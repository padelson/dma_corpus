disproportionately affects in a material respect the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies that conduct

recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or
other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to Acquisition Subs acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment
to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. Unless extended as provided in
this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the
date (the "Initial Expiration Date") that is twenty (20) Business Days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the
Exchange Act) after the commencement of the Offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, on the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of
which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied
and has not been waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms
hereof), subject to Parents and the Companys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, then Acquisition Sub shall extend (and
re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the Initial Expiration
Date for one or more periods, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10)
Business Days each, ending no later than the Outside Date, to permit such
Offer Condition to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , if, on the Initial
Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled
to expire, the Minimum Tender Condition is the only Offer Condition that has
not been satisfied or waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the
terms hereof), (i) Acquisition Sub shall, if and as requested by the Company
in writing, extend the Offer and its expiration date beyond the Initial
Expiration Date for one or more periods, in consecutive increments of up to
ten (10) Business Days each, ending no later than the Outside Date or (ii)
Acquisition Sub may extend the Offer and its expiration date beyond the
Initial Expiration Date for one period of up to ten (10) Business Days. In
addition, notwithstanding the satisfaction of any or all of the Offer
Conditions, if the Company either receives an Acquisition Proposal or
delivers to Parent a Recommendation Change Notice ten (10) or

 



-17-   fewer Business Days prior to the Initial Expiration Date or such other
subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, and the Company
provides Parent with a written request that Acquisition Sub extend the Offer,
then Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer and its expiration date to such
date as is necessary to ensure the Offer does not expire until ten (10)
Business Days from the date of such request, or for such shorter period as
may be specified by the Company in such written request. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Acquisition Sub shall, without the consent of
the Company, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or any rule or
regulation of the NYSE, in each case, applicable to the Offer. Only in the
event the exercise of the Top-Up would be insufficient to cause Parent to
reach the Short-Form Threshold or the Top-Up is otherwise held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or is enjoined by such court,
Acquisition Sub may, and the Offer Documents may reserve the right of
Acquisition Sub to, extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) in compliance
with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act and all other provisions
of applicable securities laws immediately following the expiration of the
Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and
the Offer, Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, and Acquisition Sub shall,
accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as so extended by such
subsequent offering period as promptly as reasonably practicable after any
such shares of Company Common Stock are tendered during such subsequent
offering period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

(e) _Payment_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer
and this Agreement (including the right to withhold pursuant to _Section
3.8(h)_ of this Agreement) and to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent and
Acquisition Sub in accordance with _Section 2.1(b) _of the Offer Conditions
as of the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_, the "Expiration Date"), Acquisition Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment, and pay
for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Expiration Date and in any
event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
payment for shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to
and subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as
the "Offer Closing", and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date".

(f) _Termination of Offer_. The Offer may be terminated prior to the Initial
Expiration Date, or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to
expire, only with the prior written consent of the Company, unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 10.1_. If
this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, Acquisition
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, (i) promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination) terminate the
Offer and in any event not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant thereto and (ii) promptly return, and shall cause any depositary
acting on behalf of Acquisition Sub to return, in accordance with applicable
Law, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders
thereof.

(g) _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall, after affording the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"),
which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents
attached as exhibits thereto, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the "Offer

 



-18-   Documents") and promptly thereafter shall cause the dissemination of the
Offer Documents to the holders of the Company Common Stock as required by
applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition
Sub all information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable
securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Acquisition Sub for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent necessary so that such information does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents,
as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Offer
Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence
between Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents. Prior to the filing of the Offer
Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination
thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments
of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose promptly comments on such document or
response.

(h) _Funds_. Subject in all respects to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer Conditions, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Acquisition Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase
any shares of Company Common Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

2.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) _Consent to the Offer_. Subject to _Section 6.3_, the Company hereby
approves of and consents to the Offer and consents to the inclusion of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, and the Company shall not
withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub except as provided for in _Section 6.3_. 

(b) _Schedule 14D-9_. As promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any
event, within twelve (12) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement,
the Company, after affording Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"),
which shall include the Company Board Recommendation and the Fairness Opinion
and promptly thereafter the Company shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9, by
inclusion thereof with the Offer Documents (if the Offer Documents have not
yet been so disseminated), by mail to the holders of the Company Common Stock.
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company in
writing all information concerning Parent and Acquisition Sub that may be
required by applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by the Company
for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent necessary so that such information does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in

 



-19-   light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected,
to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent and Acquisition Sub upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and
shall provide Parent and Acquisition Sub with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders
of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or the
staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and
Acquisition Sub and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose promptly comments on such document or response.

 

(c) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the
Company shall furnish or cause its transfer agent to furnish Acquisition Sub
promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record
holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date, together with copies of
all lists of stockholders, security position listings of shares of Company
Common Stock held in stock depositories, computer files and all other
information in the Companys (or its transfer agents) possession or control
regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish
to Acquisition Sub such information (including updated lists of stockholders,
security position listings of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock
depositories and computer files) and assistance as Parent or Acquisition Sub
may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and
beneficial holders of the Company Common Stock. In addition, in connection
with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause third parties to, cooperate with Parent and Acquisition Sub
to disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders of Company Common Stock held
in or subject to any Company Stock Plan and to permit such holders of Company
Common Stock to tender their Company Common Stock into the Offer. Subject to
the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall not use or disclose the information contained in any
such labels, lists, listings and files other than in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon
request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information
then in their possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

2.3 _Top-Up_.

(a) _Top-Up_. The Company hereby grants to Acquisition Sub an irrevocable
right (the "Top-Up"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth
in this  _Section 2.3_, and only for so long as this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, to purchase at a price per share equal
to the Offer Price up to a number of newly issued (treating shares owned by
the Company as treasury stock as unissued), fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") that, when added to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by
Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of the Top-Up Closing (after giving
effect to the Offer Closing), shall constitute one share of Company Common
Stock more than the number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary for
Acquisition Sub to be merged with and into the Company without a vote or
consent of the Companys stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL (the "Short-Form Threshold");

 



-20-    _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up may not be exercised (i) to
purchase an amount of Top-Up Shares in excess of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock authorized and unissued (treating shares owned by the
Company as treasury stock as unissued) and not otherwise reserved or committed
for issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up, (ii) unless the Offer
Closing shall have occurred, (iii) unless, immediately after such exercise,
Parent and its Subsidiaries would own a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to meet the Short Form Threshold or (iv) in the event the Top-Up
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or is
enjoined by such court. The Top-Up shall be exercisable only once.

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up; Top-Up Closing_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 2.3(a)_ and the satisfaction of the conditions to the
Merger, including _Section 9.1(b)_ but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding
_Section 9.1(a)_, if there shall not have been validly tendered in the Offer
and not validly withdrawn that number of shares of Company Common Stock which,
when added to the shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries, would meet the Short Form Threshold, Acquisition Sub shall be
deemed to have exercised the Top-Up for such number of Top-Up Shares as is
necessary for Acquisition Sub to reach the Short-Form Threshold and on such
date shall give the Company prior written notice specifying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing).
The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice
(and in any event no later than the Offer Closing Date), deliver written
notice to Acquisition Sub specifying, based on the information provided by
Acquisition Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased
and, upon request of Acquisition Sub, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to
Acquisition Sub the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up and after giving
effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Shares (the "Top-Up Closing"), which shall take place at the
location of the Merger Closing specified in  _Section 3.2_ and shall take
place simultaneously with, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the
Offer Closing, the purchase price owed by Acquisition Sub to the Company to
purchase the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company, at Acquisition Subs
option, (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, or (ii) by (x) paying
in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to not less than
the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering
to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the
aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up less the amount paid in cash
pursuant to the preceding _clause (x)_ (the "Promissory Note"). The
Promissory Note (i) shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up
Closing, (ii) shall bear simple interest of 5% per annum, (iii) shall be full
recourse to Parent and Acquisition Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole or in
part, at any time without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other
material terms. The Company Board and the Special Committee have determined
that such consideration for the Top-Up Shares is adequate.

(c) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that
the Top-Up Shares that Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-
Up will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in
reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities
Act. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that Acquisition Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares,
an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up and the Top-Up Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up are being and will be acquired by
Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of
the Securities Act).

 



-21-  (d) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Parties agree that neither any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of
Company Common Stock as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares nor any
cash or the Promissory Note delivered to the Company in payment for such Top-
Up Shares will be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of
any Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by
_Section 3.7(c)_, and that none of the Parties shall take any position to
the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

2.4 _Notices of Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement,
including the exercise of the Top-Up, and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually
agreed to by the Company and Parent, any shares of Company Common Stock
subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly
tendered into the Offer unless and until the shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on behalf
of Acquisition Sub.

 

2.5 _Directors_.

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Promptly upon the
purchase of, and payment for, a number of shares of Company Common Stock by
Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer that, together with any other shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and its Affiliates,
represents at least such number of shares of Company Common Stock as shall
satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition, and at all times thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up
to the next whole number, to the Company Board as will give Parent
representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number of directors
that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company
Board (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including for purposes of this _Section 2.5(a)_ such shares of
Company Common Stock as are accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the
Offer) bears to the total number of shares of issued and outstanding Company
Common Stock, and the Company shall cause Parents designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board, including by increasing the number of
directors, seeking and accepting the resignation of incumbent directors,
amending the Company Bylaws and taking any other actions that are necessary to
accomplish the foregoing. At each such time, the Company shall also cause (A)
each committee of the Company Board and (B) if requested by Parent, each
board of directors (or similar governing body) of each Subsidiary of the
Company (and each committee thereof) to include persons designated by Parent
representing at least the same percentage of each such committee, board or
governing body as Parents designees represent on the Company Board. The
provisions of this _Section 2.5_ are in addition to, and shall not limit, any
rights that Parent or Acquisition Sub may have as a record holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of Law or
otherwise with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

(b)  _Independent Directors_. In the event that Parents designees are
appointed or elected to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_, then
until the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause at least three members of the Company Board as of
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (the "Existing Directors"), who are
neither officers of the Company nor designees, stockholders, Affiliates
or associates (within the meaning of the securities Laws) of Parent and who
will be independent and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee for
purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
the NYSE ("Independent," and such Independent directors, the "Independent
Directors") to remain as directors, (ii) cause at least one of the Independent
Directors to be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item
407(d)(5)(ii) of

 



-22-   Regulation S-K of the SEC, and (iii) designate a committee of the Company
Board, which shall be composed solely of Existing Directors and which shall,
subject to applicable Law, be delegated all power, right and authority of the
Company Board with respect to the Existing Director Committee Actions (as
defined in _Section 2.5(c)_) (the "Existing Director Committee") and to
continue the existence of such Existing Director Committee until the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if at any time there are fewer
than three Existing Directors on the Existing Director Committee, the Company
Board will take all action necessary to cause an Independent person or, if
there is only one Existing Director on the Existing Director Committee, two
Independent persons designated by the remaining Existing Director(s) to fill
such vacancy(ies), and each such person shall be deemed to be an Existing
Director for purposes of this Agreement, or, if there are no Existing
Directors on the Existing Director Committee, the Company Board shall
designate three Independent persons to fill such vacancies, and each such
person shall be deemed to be an Existing Director for purposes of this
Agreement.

(c) _Existing Director Approval_. After directors designated by Parent are
elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ and
prior to the Effective Time, the approval of the Existing Director Committee,
by a majority vote of its members, shall be required for the Company
to authorize (and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no
other action on the part of the Company Board or the Company, including any
action by any other director, shall be required to authorize) (i) any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this
Agreement, (iii) any extension of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or actions hereunder by a Party other than the Company or (iv)
any waiver of compliance with any of the terms, agreements or conditions
contained herein for the benefit of the Company or any Person that is a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 11.5_ ( _clauses
(i)_ through _(iv)_ , the "Existing Director Committee Actions").

(d) _Section 14 of the Exchange Act_. The Company shall promptly take all
action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.5_,
including mailing to its stockholders an information statement containing the
information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder, and the Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
make such mailing concurrently with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9. Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall supply the Company any information with respect to
itself and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to be included in such information statement.

(e) _Effects on Continued Listing_. Following the Offer Closing, the Company
shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated
as a "controlled company" as defined by Rule 303A of the NYSE Listed Company
Manual (or any successor provision) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status.

later than the second Business Day) following, the Offer Closing (or the Top-
Up Closing if the Top-Up has been exercised), provided that the conditions
set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be

3.3 _The Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the Merger Closing Date, the Parties
shall file a certificate of ownership and merger or a certificate of merger
(in either case, the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by,
and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL, and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on such date and time as the
Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such other date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree
and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the
Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective
Time".

 

3.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein
and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, and all of the claims,
obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub
shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

3.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate of Incorporation as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended so as to read
in its entirety in a form to be agreed upon by Parent and Company in their
respective reasonable discretion and, as so amended, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to  _Section 7.1_.

(b) The Parties shall take all necessary action such that, at the Effective
Time, the Company By-Laws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended so that they will be identical to the bylaws of
Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except

resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 



-24-  (b) _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly

3.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

(i) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of capital stock of
Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(ii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A)
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (B) except as provided in _Section 3.7(c)_, the
Appraisal Shares) shall be automatically converted, subject to _Section
3.7(b)_, into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in
book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to
have any rights or claims with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and any dividends declared from and after the date
hereof with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time and that are due to such holder.

 

(iii) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company or by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor. 

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement but without duplication of the provisions of
_Section 2.1(c)_, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, there shall be any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the
effect thereof, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide
to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

(c) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and

 



-25-   who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
(the "Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled, and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights or claims with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL
or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section
3.7(a)(ii)_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock or written threats thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle or approve any
withdrawal of, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the
foregoing.

 

(d) _Company Restricted Stock_. Each holder of an unvested award of Company
Restricted Stock shall have the right to tender such Company Restricted Stock
into the Offer. Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Acquisition Sub
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in accordance with
_Section 2.1(e)_ (the "Acceptance Time"), each share of Company Restricted
Stock shall become fully vested, and the restrictions thereon shall lapse. The
Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.7(d)_ under the Company Stock Plans and any
other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all notices and
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof.

 

(e) _Company Options_. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall assume any
Company Options in connection with the Offer, Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Acceptance Time, each
outstanding, unexpired and unexercised Company Option shall vest and become
exercisable. To the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, then
upon the Effective Time each Company Option shall be deemed to be exercised
and canceled, with each former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock
Option becoming entitled to receive from the Company, at the Effective Time or
as soon as practicable thereafter, in consideration of the deemed exercise
and cancellation of such Company Option, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option; _provided_ that if the exercise price per
share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the per share
Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled and terminated
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The Company shall take
all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 3.7(e)_ under all Company Option agreements and any other plan or
arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required notices and
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof.

 



-26-  (f) _Company Warrants_. Upon the Effective Time, each Company Warrant, to the
extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall be deemed to be
exercised and canceled, with each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Warrant becoming entitled to receive from the Company, at the Effective Time
or as soon as practicable thereafter, in consideration of the deemed exercise
and cancellation of such Company Warrant, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Warrant multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant. The Company shall take all actions necessary
to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.7(f)_ under all
related agreements or arrangements of the Company, including delivering all
required notices and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof.

 

(g) _Payment of Merger Consideration_. Parent may cause the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Options and
Company Restricted Stock to be delivered through the Companys ordinary
payroll system in lieu of delivering a check or making a wire transfer to such
holders.

 

(h) _Company Stock Plans_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that (i) all awards issued under the Company Stock Plans shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time, and (ii) neither any holder of awards
under the Company Stock Plans, nor any other participant in any Company Stock
Plans shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or Parent, or to receive any payment
or benefit with respect to any award previously granted under the Company
Stock Plans, except as provided for in _Sections 3.7(a)(ii)_ and _3.7(e)_.
After the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans shall be terminated and no
further awards or other rights with respect to Equity Interests in the Company
shall be granted thereunder.

3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _ARTICLE III_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in the form reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the "Paying Agency Agreement"). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to
this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"). If any holder of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such Appraisal Shares, and the Exchange Fund shall
be deemed to include the cash so deposited.

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary
form (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form)), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of shares of 

 



-27-   Company Common Stock shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to  _Section
3.7(a)(ii)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration and any dividends declared with a record date prior to
the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time with respect to
such Company Common Stock may be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration and any such
dividends to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section
3.8(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect
of such Certificate pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ and any dividends
declared with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. No interest shall be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this _ARTICLE III_.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE
III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay all dividends declared with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as
provided in this _ARTICLE III_.

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of record of shares of Company Common
Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this  _ARTICLE III_
and any dividends declared with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to any such holder.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



-28-  (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent and in accordance with the terms of
the Paying Agency Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid solely to Parent, and any Taxes resulting therefrom
shall be paid by Parent. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses
resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of
any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
herein. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the
Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such
payments.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends declared with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time with respect thereto.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price,
Merger Consideration, Equity Award Amounts and any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
any holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock (together,
the "Company Equity Awards"), as applicable, such amounts as Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or the holder of the
Company Equity Award, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent.

 

3.9 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of the Company
and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), or
(ii) as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed by the Company with the
SEC and made publicly available within the three (3) year period prior to the
date hereof (other than in any "risk factor" disclosure or any other forward-
looking statements or other disclosures included in such documents that are
generally cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature, and it being
recognized that this _clause (ii)_ shall not be applicable to any of
_Sections 4.3_ , _4.4_ ,  _4.7_ , _4.28_ and _4.30_ ), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub as follows:

 



-29-  4.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly organized
and validly existing under Delaware Law, and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted
and to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing (to the extent either such
concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities
make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing has not had, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has publicly filed with the SEC
or made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company By-Laws, as amended to date,
and the Company is not in material violation of such organizational documents.

4.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub in _Section
5.7(a)_, the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Support Agreement, to perform its
covenants and obligations hereunder and thereunder and, subject, in the case
of the Merger, to obtaining the Stockholder Approval if required
under applicable Law, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent
and Acquisition Sub in _Section 5.7(a)_, the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement and the Support Agreement, the performance by the
Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and thereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company and no additional corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company
of this Agreement, the Support Agreement, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations hereunder and thereunder or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, other than, in the case of
the Merger, obtaining the Stockholder Approval if required by applicable Law
and filing the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. Each of this Agreement and the
Support Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Acquisition Sub, and the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Parent and Acquisition Sub in _Section 5.7(a)_, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (x) may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally, and (y) is
subject to general principles of equity ( _clause (x)_ and _(y)_
collectively, the "Enforceability Exception").

 

4.3 _Board Actions; Amendment to Rights Plan_.

(a) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held at which all
directors of the Company were present, upon the unanimous recommendation of
the Special Committee, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i)
authorizing and approving the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, (ii) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, (iii) declaring that this Agreement, the Support
Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company Stockholders,
(iv) directing that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a
meeting of the Company 

 



-30-   Stockholders unless the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys
stockholders is not required by applicable Law, (v) recommending that the
Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and, if required by applicable Law, adopt
this Agreement (this _clause (v)_ , the "Company Board Recommendation"), (vi)
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and
Acquisition Sub in _Section 5.7(a)_, causing any restrictions of any
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination," "fair
price" or other form of anti-takeover Laws (collectively, "Takeover Laws") of
any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to the Company, Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or this Agreement, the
Support Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer, the Top-Up and the Merger) and thereby with respect to any of the
foregoing not to apply or to have been satisfied with respect to each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates solely with respect
to this Agreement, the Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Offer, the Top-Up and the Merger) and thereby, and (vii)
authorizing and approving the Top-Up, all of the terms thereof and the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares thereunder, which resolutions, as of the date of
this Agreement, have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn.

(b) The Company Board has taken all necessary action so that (i) none of the
execution or delivery of this Agreement and the Support Agreement or the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement or the Support Agreement will result in (A) Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any Affiliate thereof being deemed to be an Acquiring
Person (as such terms are defined in the Rights Plan), (B) the occurrence of
a Triggering Event (as defined in the Rights Plan), or (C) the distribution of
Rights Certificates (as defined in the Rights Plan) separate from the
certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii)
the Rights will expire and be of no further force or effect pursuant to the
terms of the Rights Plan at the Effective Time.

4.4  _Voting Requirements_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in _Section 5.7(a)_, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (the "Stockholder Approval") is the only vote, if
any, of the holders of any class or series of capital stock or other Equity
Interests of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement, and to approve
and consummate the Merger, and no other vote of the Company Stockholders is
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (other than a
non-binding advisory vote on "golden parachute" arrangements in the event the
Proxy Statement is required).

4.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the Support Agreement, the performance by the Company of its
covenants and obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
will not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of (i) the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-Laws or (ii) the comparable
organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, subject to, in
the case of the Merger, if required by applicable Law, obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, (b) subject to obtaining such Consents set forth in
_Section 4.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, violate, conflict with, or
result in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or result in
the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of first offer, first refusal, modification, termination, acceleration
or loss of benefit under, any Contract to which the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of their properties or
assets may be bound, (c) assuming the Consents referred to in  _Section 4.5_
of the Company Disclosure Letter are obtained or made, and assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub
in _Section 5.7(a)_, and subject to, in the case of the Merger, if required
by applicable Law, obtaining the Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict
with any Law or Order

 



-31-   applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of
their properties or assets are bound, or (d) result in the creation of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of _clauses
(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ above, for such violations, conflicts, defaults,
terminations, accelerations, Liens, rights of first offer, first refusal,
modification, or loss of benefits which would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.6 _Required Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, or notification to (any of
the foregoing being referred to herein as a "Consent"), any Governmental
Authority is required on the part of the Company in connection with the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except (a) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
such filings with Governmental Authorities to satisfy the applicable Laws of
states in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business,
(b) such filings and approvals as may be required by any federal or state
securities laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, including the Schedule 14D-9 and, if required by applicable Law,
the Proxy Statement, (c) Consents required under any applicable Antitrust
Laws, (d) any filings or notices required under the rules and regulations of
the NYSE and (e) such other Consents, the failure of which to obtain would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.7 _Company Capitalization_.

(a) As of the close of business on March 9, 2012, the authorized capital stock
of the Company consisted of (i) 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of

(a) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its respective
organization (to the extent either such concept is recognized under
applicable Law), except where the failure to be in good standing has not had,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Companys Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority to carry on
its respective business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease
or operate its respective properties and assets. Each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent
either such concept is recognized under applicable Law), except where the

in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

the Company (collectively, the "Subsidiary Securities") (i) is duly
authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) is
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all Liens

Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments). 

(b) The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such terms
are defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) that satisfy the
requirements of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information
concerning the Company (including its Subsidiaries) is made known on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company SEC
Reports.

 



-34-  (c) The Company maintains "internal control over financial reporting" (as

are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared

transaction involving, or liabilities of, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiaries published financial
statements or other Company SEC Report.

(f) The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. The Company has not identified any material weaknesses in its
internal controls, and the Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances
that would prevent its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
from giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due. Since January 3, 2009, neither the

_however_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule

shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if, (i)
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after

Recommendation Change (a "Recommendation Change Notice") (it being agreed

notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, or update or amend
public disclosures with respect thereto shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); (B) if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available to discuss
with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate

by the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice and ending at
5:00 p.m. Central Time on the third (3rd) Business Day after the day of
delivery by the Company to Parent of the Recommendation Change Notice (the

have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel), after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement, that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ that in the event of any material change during the Match Period to
any of the facts that is the basis of the proposed Company Board
Recommendation Change, including any material revisions to an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new Recommendation Change
Notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.3_

Notice and the reasons therefor, and a new Match Period shall commence upon
the delivery of such new Recommendation Change Notice.

and representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to
the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii) access to
such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving
any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege applicable to such documents or information, (iii) access to such
documents or information would violate any obligation of confidentiality by
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, or (iv) access to a Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound
would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right to
terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; and _provided
further_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of
the Company set forth in this Agreement. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents or approvals
to permit disclosure and access to the materials referred to in
_clauses (iii)_ and _(iv)_ of the immediately preceding sentence. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.4_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys properties shall be subject
to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
shall not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and

any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
relating to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party that relate to
this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this

such litigation. Each Party hereto shall give the other Parties the
opportunity to consult with such Party regarding the defense or settlement of

with respect to such shareholder litigation; _provided_ that the Company shall
also give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
of any shareholder action against the Company and/or its directors or officers

settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or
non-occurrence, as the case may be, would be likely to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate as if made as of any time prior to the Effective Time, such that
the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ or _ARTICLE IX_ would not be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this 
_Section 6.9_ shall not (a) limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the representations or
warranties of the parties, or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereto or (b) cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision
of this Agreement. Furthermore, the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party in
connection with this Agreement from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject
matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such
consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent
or to the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.10 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company (acting
through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) will use reasonable
best efforts to seek to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d) under the
Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangements that have been or will be entered into by Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates with current or future directors, officers
or employees of the Company and its Affiliates and to insure that (a) any such
arrangements (including any amendment or modification thereof) and (b) any
payments made or to be made or benefits granted or to be granted according to
such arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of such rule. Prior
to taking the actions required by this  _Section 6.10_, the Company will
provide Parent copies of any resolutions or similar documentation with respect
to such actions and an opportunity to provide reasonable comment thereon.

 



-60-  ARTICLE VII

_COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_

7.1 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under (i) any indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provision
set forth in any certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, and (ii) all indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former directors and officers (along with any person who becomes a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, the "Indemnified Persons"). In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause
the articles of incorporation and by-laws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement
of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation
and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the articles of
incorporation and by-laws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year
period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified
in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) In addition to the provisions of _Section 7.1(a)_, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent the Company would have been permitted to
do so under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the
limitations on the Companys ability to indemnify its directors and officers
under Section 145 of the DGCL), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to any action or omission or alleged action or
omission prior to or at the Effective Time in such Indemnified Persons
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section 7.1(b)_ and
the specific basis thereof, then the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition, during the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent the Company would have been permitted to do so
under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the limitations
on the Companys ability to indemnify its directors and officers under Section
145 of the DGCL), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person
therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection
with the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
solely upon the execution and delivery to the Surviving Corporation and
Parent of an undertaking providing that the Indemnified Person undertakes to
repay the advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined that the
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving
Corporation under the provisions of this Agreement, the organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation or applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for advancement under this _Section 7.1(b)_ and the
specific basis thereof, then the right to advancement asserted in such notice
shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as
such claim is fully and finally

 



-61-  resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (i) Parent shall have the right to control the defense thereof after
the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain
his or her own counsel, whether or not Parent shall elect to control the
defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iii) no
Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or
her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section 7.1(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) shall
settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination (x) includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, and (y) does not include any statement as to
admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Person. Each Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified Persons
collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section
7.1(b)_, and each such Person shall have a right to enforce the rights
hereunder as if such person was a party to this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) obtain and fully pay for "tail" prepaid insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance (collectively, "DandO
Insurance"), for the Indemnified Persons, with terms, conditions, retentions
and levels of coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the
Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby). If such "tail" prepaid insurance policies
have been obtained, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time to, maintain such policies in full force and effect,
for their full term, and to continue to honor its respective obligations
thereunder. If the Company fails to obtain such "tail" prepaid
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time for the Indemnified Persons, the DandO
Insurance ( _provided_ that Parent (or any successor) may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage and amounts which are, in the aggregate, as favorable to the
Indemnified Persons as provided in the existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in
no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required, and the Company
shall not be permitted, to expend for such policies pursuant to this _Section
7.1_ an annualized premium amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance and, if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and the Company may, obtain a substantially similar policy
(from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier) with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount. Each Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified Persons
collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section
7.1(c)_, and each such Person shall have a right to enforce the rights
hereunder as if such person was a party to this Agreement.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section 7.1_. Each Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified Persons
collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section
7.1(d)_, and each such Person shall have a right to enforce the rights
hereunder _as if s_ uch person was a party to this Agreement.

 



-62-  (e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under
the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (and
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the
"tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons and each of the
other persons who are beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (and their heirs and representatives)
is intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.1_, with full
rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (and their heirs
and representatives)) under this _Section 7.1_ shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under
the certificates of incorporation, by-laws or other equivalent organizational
documents of, or any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or
in equity). 

(f) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this  _Section 7.1_ shall be joint and
several.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.1_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

7.2 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Effective Time, as applic _able._  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans and
compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending
or terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate, any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance
with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(c) For a period of three months following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee, the Employee
Plans and any other employee benefit plans or other compensation and severance
arrangements of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries (together, the "Company Plans" but excluding equity-based
benefits and individual employment agreements) at benefit levels that are no
less than those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of
this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing
Employee under such Company Plans, or (ii) provide compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and individual
employment 

 



-63-   agreements) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and individual
employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time ("Comparable Plans"), or (iii) provide some combination
of (i) and (ii) above such that each Continuing Employee receives
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based
benefits and individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and individual employment
agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In each case, base compensation as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall not be decreased for a period of three months following
the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period.

(d) To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to
any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause
to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (but not for benefit accrual purposes except for
vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement) to the same extent recognized
by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
,  _however_ , that such service need not be credited to the extent that it
would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate in any and all employee benefit plans
sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company Plans), and Parent shall cause to be waived all eligibility waiting
periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any
pre-existing conditions limitations under such plans (such plans,
collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall waive, or use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause insurance companies to waive, all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending plan with
any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the
applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by
a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall
not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit
future accruals, except in all cases to the same extent as provided under the
terms of the vacation or paid time off program in effect with respect to
employees of the Surviving Company.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, (ii) confer
upon any Person (including any current or former director, officer or
employee of, or consultant or

 



-64-   independent contractor to, the Company, Parent, or Surviving Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries) any third party beneficiary or other rights
or remedies, (iii) constitute an amendment to any Employee Plan, or (iv)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
_Section 7.2_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time.

7.3 _Other Actions by Parent and Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall, promptly
following the execution of this Agreement, approve and adopt this Agreement in
its capacity as sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub in accordance with
applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Acquisition
Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written
consent so approving and adopting this Agreement.

7.4  _Tax Matters_ . All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes and including any filing and recording fees) and
related amounts (including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) and
all such reasonable costs (including accounting and legal fees) associated
with filing all Tax Returns related to transfer Taxes incurred by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby ("Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by Parent.
Parent shall be responsible for filing all Tax Returns related to Transfer
Taxes. All Parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
avail themselves of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and
to cooperate with the other Parties hereto in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

or Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other

or has (or would reasonably be expected to have) the effect of, preventing,
impairing, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or the ability of such Party to fully perform its
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no action permitted to be taken pursuant to _Section 6.2_
or _Section 6.3_ shall be prohibited, or required to be taken, by this
sentence.

 



-65-  8.2 _Regulatory Filings_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event

and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as

faith and in consultation with each other. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate and coordinate with
the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any
information that reasonably may be required in order to make such filings,
(iii) supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall, and shall cause their

Parties of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of

any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any Party hereto or
Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or

other Antitrust Laws with respect to which any such filings have been made,
then such Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other Party, an appropriate response in compliance with such
request. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent

Authority regarding the Offer or the Merger, (vi) provide each other (or
counsel of each Party, as appropriate) with copies of all written

to the others may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under
applicable Law or as appropriate to protect Confidential Information.

Company agree to, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
take any and all actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or
approvals required under or in connection with any domestic or foreign

expire, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law asserted by any Governmental Authority, in each case, to cause
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby to occur prior to
the Outside Date, including but not limited to (i) promptly complying with any
requests for additional information by any Governmental Authority, and (ii)
contesting, defending and appealing any threatened or pending preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree, ruling, statute, rule, regulation
or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of any Party hereto
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and taking any and all
other actions to prevent the entry, enactment, or promulgation thereof;
_provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require that
Parent offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of
any or all of the capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of
Parent, its Subsidiaries and its and their Affiliates and the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

"Proxy Statement"), to be mailed to the Company Stockholders at the earliest
practicable date after the date that the SEC confirms it has no further
comments. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to: (i) respond as promptly

the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto,
and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or warranty is made by Parent
or Acquisition Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent
and Acquisition Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Preliminary Proxy
Statement and the Proxy Statement promptly following request therefor from the
Company.

 

(e) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall vote or cause to be voted all
shares of Company Common Stock acquired in the Offer or otherwise
beneficially owned by it or any of its Affiliates as of the applicable record
date or with respect to which it or any of its Affiliates has the power (by

stockholders of the Company by consent in lieu of a meeting).

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary, if,
following the Offer Closing and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up, Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the

action, including (i) with respect to the transfer to Acquisition Sub of any
shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or its Affiliates and (ii)

required by Section 253 of the DGCL, to cause the Merger to become effective
as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 

8.4 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that the restrictions of any state
anti-takeover or other similar Law are or become applicable to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than, with
respect to the Company, as a result of the inaccuracy of the representations
and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub in  _Section 5.7(a)_), the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and

minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and
Parent, and thereafter none of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and
Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public release or make any
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or
regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the relevant Party is subject
or submits, wherever situated, in which case the Party required to make the
release or

 



-68-   announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the
other Party or Parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of
any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 8.5_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or
proposed to be made by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3_ or following a
Company Board Recommendation Change.

acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain at the Acceptance Time a pay-off letter in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, evidencing the amount (the "Pay-off Amount")
necessary to pay-off, at the Acceptance Time, all existing indebtedness and
other obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement. At the Acceptance Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, (i) pay, on behalf
of the Company, the Pay-off Amount to an account or accounts designated by the
administrative agent under the Existing Credit Agreement and (ii) provide, on
behalf of the Company, such other funds or backstop letters of credit as may
be necessary to satisfy the conditions precedent to termination of the
Existing Credit Agreement under the pay-off letter, such payments and
provisions to be loans to, or otherwise for the account of, the Company on
terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company.

-69-  ARTICLE X

_TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be validly terminated and the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (or in the case of the
termination right set forth in  _Section 10.1(c)_, at any time prior to the
Effective Time) only as follows (it being understood and hereby agreed that
this Agreement may not be terminated for any other reason or on any other
basis):

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either the Company or Parent in the event that the Offer Closing shall
not have occurred on or before July 12, 2012 (such date referred to herein as
the "Outside Date");  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be
available to Parent if (A) Parents or Acquisition Subs actions or omissions
have been a principal cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the
Offer Closing to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to
act constitutes a breach of this Agreement or (B) Parent or Acquisition Sub is
in material breach of this Agreement, and (ii) the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to the
Company if (A) the Companys actions or omissions have been a principal cause
of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the Offer Closing to occur on or
before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
this Agreement or (B) the Company is in material breach of this Agreement;

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent if there shall be any Law enacted by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction after the date of this
Agreement remaining in effect that makes the acceptance for payment of or
payment for Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer illegal or
that prohibits the consummation of the Merger, or any court of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the
acceptance for payment of or payment for Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
injunction shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the case of an injunction a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(c)_ if the issuance
of any such injunction is attributable to the failure of such Party (or any
Affiliate of such Party) to perform any covenant or other obligation under
this Agreement required to be performed by such Party (or any Affiliate of
such Party) at or prior to the Effective Time;

 

(d) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company shall have received a
Superior Proposal and there is no material breach of  _Section 6.2(d)_; (ii)
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law; (iii) the Company shall have first
delivered to Parent a Recommendation Change Notice regarding such
Superior Proposal; (iv) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made
its Representatives available to discuss with Parents Representatives and
shall cause its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parents
Representatives (if Parent desires to negotiate) any proposed modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at
5:00 p.m. Central Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Recommendation Change Notice and ending three (3) Business Days later at 5:00
p.m. Central Time (it being understood and hereby agreed that such three (3)
Business Day period shall be the Match Period stipulated by _Section 6.3(a)_
and subject to its requirements, including the renewal of the Match Period);
(v) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal

 



-70-   counsel), after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement, that the Superior Proposal remains as such and
the failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; and (vi)
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the Company pays Parent
the Company Termination Fee payable to Parent pursuant to _Section 10.3(d)_;

(e) by Parent, in the event that (i) Parent and Acquisition Sub have not
breached any of their respective representations, warranties or covenants
under this Agreement in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall have
breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement such that any of the Offer Conditions would not be satisfied and
shall have failed to cure such breach by the earlier of ten (10) Business Days
after the Company has received written notice of such breach from Parent and
the Outside Date (it being understood that Parent shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(e)_ in respect of the
breach set forth in any such written notice (x) at any time during such
period to cure, and (y) at any time after such period to cure if the Company
shall have cured such breach during such period and such breach remains
cured);

 

(f) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change; (ii) the
Company Board shall have failed to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation as promptly as practicable (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after receipt of a written request by Parent to provide
such reaffirmation following the public announcement of an Acquisition
Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal otherwise becoming publicly known (other
than in the circumstances contemplated by _clause (v)_ of this _Section
10.1(f)_ below, which shall instead be governed by such _clause (v)_ ); (iii)
the Company shall have failed to include in the Schedule 14D-9 when mailed the
Company Board Recommendation; (iv) the Company shall have intentionally and
materially breached _Section 6.2_ (not including any breach by any
Representative whose breach is imputed to the Company other than an
intentional and material breach by any director, officer or investment banker
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries); (v) the Company shall have
entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement; or (vi) a tender or
exchange offer for Company Common Stock that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) is commenced by a Person
unaffiliated with Parent and, within ten (10) Business Days after the public
announcement of the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall not have filed a Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act recommending that the Company Stockholders
reject such Acquisition Proposal and not tender any shares of Company Common
Stock into such tender or exchange offer;

 

(g) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company has not breached any of
its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement in any
material respect and (ii) Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have breached (A)
any of its representations or warranties under this Agreement (which breach
would or would reasonably be expected to individually or in the aggregate,
prevent or materially impede, hinder or delay the performance by Parent or
Acquisition Sub of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement or
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger) or (B) any of its covenants
or obligations hereunder, and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B),
Parent or Merger Sub shall have failed to cure such breach by the earlier of
ten (10) Business Days after Parent has received written notice of such breach
from the Company and the Outside Date (it being understood that the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1(g)_ in respect of the breach set forth in any such written notice (x) at
any time during such period to cure, and (y) at any time after such period to
cure if Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have cured such breach during such
period and such breach remains cured);

 



-71-  (h) by the Company, in the event that (i) Acquisition Sub fails to commence
the Offer within the time period required by _Section 2.1(a)_ or terminates
or makes any change to the Offer in violation of the terms of this Agreement
or (ii) at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Acquisition Sub fails
to accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer subject to the terms of and
in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ and at such time all of the conditions
set forth in _Annex A_  are satisfied and no subsequent expiration date for
the Offer is established in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
applicable Law; or

(i) by the Company, in the event that as of the expiration of the Offer where
no subsequent expiration date for the Offer is established in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and applicable Law, all of the Offer Conditions
have been satisfied or waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the
terms hereof) except for the Minimum Tender Condition.

10.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ shall be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating Party to
the other Party or Parties hereto, as applicable. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable (or any director, officer, employee, affiliate,
agent or other representative of such Party or Parties) to the other Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of  _ARTICLE I_, the
last sentence of _Section 2.2(c)_, the last sentence of _Section 6.4_,
_Section 8.6_, this _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_ and _ARTICLE XI_, each
of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (b) subject to
_Section 10.3(g)_, nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable, from liability or damages for any knowing and
intentional breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement.

10.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 10.3_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party or Parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_ or by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(b)_, (ii) neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall have
materially breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants under
this Agreement, (iii) at or prior to the time of the termination of this
Agreement a third party shall have publicly disclosed a  _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to which the holders of Company Common Stock
would be paid a price per share of Company Common Stock in excess of the
Merger Consideration (and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been
withdrawn prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement) (such
Acquisition Proposal, the "Outstanding Proposal"), and (iv) within twelve (12)
months after the termination of this Agreement (the "Tail Period"), the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to the Outstanding
Proposal and the Outstanding Proposal is consummated (whether or not such
consummation occurs within the Tail Period), then, in any such case,
the Company shall pay to Parent $5.59 million (the "Termination Fee"), less
the Expense Reimbursement to the extent previously paid pursuant to _Section
10.3(e)_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent, on the date such transaction is
consummated. For the purposes of the definition of "Outstanding Proposal"
only, references in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" to "fifteen
percent (15%)" and "eighty-five percent (85%)" shall be replaced with
references to "fifty percent (50%)."

 



-72-  (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section 10.1(d)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after written
demand by Parent;

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
10.1(f)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after written
demand by Parent; _provided_ that if Parent terminates pursuant to clause (i)
of _Section 10.1(f)_, due to a Company Board Recommendation Change and such
Company Board Recommendation Change is not with respect to a Superior
Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent $6.88 million by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination.

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(i)_ or _Section 10.1(b)_ (and in the event of termination
pursuant to  _Section 10.1(b)_, all of the Offer Conditions have been
satisfied or waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms
hereof) except for the Minimum Tender Condition), the Company shall reimburse
Parent and Acquisition Sub for all documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with this Agreement up to the date of
termination of this Agreement not to exceed $1 million in aggregate (the
"Expense Reimbursement") within two (2) Business Days following request
therefor.

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any of the
amounts due to Parent pursuant to _Sections_ _10.3(b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_ ,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that
results in an award against the Company for such fee, the Company shall pay
Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on
the amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made.

 

(g) In no event shall the Company be required to make any payment pursuant to
_Section_ _10.3(b)_ , _(c)_ ,  _(d)_ or _(e)_ on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) if the Company
makes any payment pursuant to either _Section_ _10.3(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_
or (e), then any such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Acquisition Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
equity holders, managers, members, Affiliates or successors and none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates or successors shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (y) if Parent or Acquisition Sub receives any payments from the
Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Parent is
entitled to receive the Termination Fee under _Section 10.3_, the amount of
such Termination Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments
made by the Company to Parent or Acquisition Sub in respect of any
such breaches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability or damages for any
knowing and intentional breach of, or fraud in connection with, this
Agreement.

 



-73-  10.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred or the Stockholder
Approval shall have been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) after the
Offer Closing and subject to _Section 3.7(b)_, there shall be no amendment
that decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration, and (y) after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that
by applicable Law requires further approval by the Company Stockholders
without such further approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

10.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party or Parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed
and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party or Parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party or
Parties hereto contained herein (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Minimum Tender Condition unless such waiver is consented to in writing by
the Company). Any agreement on the part of a Party or Parties hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party or Parties, as applicable. Any delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other Parties, and any assignment without such prior written approval
shall be null and void; _provided_ , that Acquisition Sub, upon prior written
notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Parent or to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, in which event all references
herein to Acquisition Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary
except that all representations and 

 



-75-   warranties made herein with respect to Acquisition Sub as of the date of

respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that (a) no such assignment may be made if it would
materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (b) no such assignment shall relieve Acquisition Sub
from any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall (i) be binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Annexes
hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time
and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance
with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto. EACH PARTY
HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES,
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE
COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR
REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO
THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR
COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE) BY ITSELF OR
ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER
OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

 

11.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 



-76-  11.7 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that in any such case any breach of this Agreement could not be
adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 10.1_, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with _Section 11.9_, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of
this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party hereto accordingly agrees not
to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party
under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.7_.
Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to post a bond or undertaking in connection
with such order or injunction sought in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 11.7_.

11.8 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT
LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON,
RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

 

11.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle
County in the State of Delaware or Delaware Superior Court, for the purpose of
any Legal Proceeding directly or indirectly based upon, relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or
proceeding shall be brought in, and may be heard and determined, exclusively
in such state or federal courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in, and any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any action or proceeding
so brought. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any action or

corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company

_Conditions to the Offer_

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Acquisition
Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause
Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act (relating to Acquisition Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered
shares of Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of
the Offer), pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) if: (a)
there shall not be validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the Offer a number of shares of Company Common Stock, which,
when added to the number of shares already owned by Parent and Acquisition
Sub and their respective Subsidiaries and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying the Company Stock Options that are available to be
acquired by Parent immediately after the Acceptance Time pursuant to the
Support Agreement, represent at least a majority of the sum of (x) the issued
and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the expiration of the
Offer, _plus_ (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable to holders of outstanding Company Stock Options (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Company
Stock Options that are available to be acquired by Parent immediately after
the Acceptance Time pursuant to the Support Agreement), _plus_ (z) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable to holders of
outstanding Company Warrants (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); (b)
the waiting period applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger under the HSR
Act (or any extension thereof) shall have neither expired nor terminated; or
(c) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the expiration of the Offer:

(i) there shall be any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent in
nature) issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other restraint or
prohibition of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in effect,
or any Law enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable by
any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and remaining in effect,
that, in any such case, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger;

 

(ii) (A) any representations or warranties of the Company contained in
_Section 4.3_, _Section 4.4_,  _Section 4.7_ (other than _Section
4.7(a)_), _Section 4.28_ and _Section 4.30 _(x) if qualified as to
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect, shall fail to be true and
correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent
such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date), or (y) if not qualified as to
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect, shall fail to be true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the
extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date); (B) the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.7(a)_ shall fail to be true and correct in
all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date
as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which
case as of such earlier date), subject only to  _de minimis_ exceptions; (C)
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.13(a)(ii)_ shall
fail to be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date; or (D)
any of the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) disregarding all
qualifications or limitations as to materiality, Company Material Adverse
Effect and words of similar import set forth therein, except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



1 (iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all
material respects with its obligations required to be performed or complied
with by it under this Agreement;

(iv) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred and be
continuing a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(v) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate
executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the conditions set
forth in _clauses (c)(ii)_ , _(c)(iii)_ , and _(c)(iv)_ above shall have
occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition
Sub and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and
Acquisition Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their
sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition).

 

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not defined in this _Annex A_
shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of March 12, 2012, by and among TBC Corporation, Gearshift Merger Corp. and
Midas, Inc.
