The Unit Holders Representative must deliver written notice to Acquiror setting forth in reasonable detail any objections it has with respect to the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice no later than thirty (30) days after the date on which Acquiror delivered the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice (the " _Notice of Objection_ "). If the Unit Holders Representative does not so deliver the Notice of Objection within such thirty (30) day period, the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice shall become conclusive and binding on the parties and the Unit Holders for all purposes of this Agreement.

 (b) If the Unit Holders Representative and Acquiror are unable to resolve all of the Objections within said thirty (30) day period, they shall refer any remaining Objections that have not been resolved by such date to the CPA Firm, which, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall make its determination as to the resolution of such remaining Objections. Acquiror and the Unit Holders Representative shall instruct the CPA Firm to deliver its written determination to Acquiror and the Unit Holders Representative no later than thirty (30) days after their submission to it of such remaining Objections. The CPA Firms determination with respect to the remaining Objections shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties and the Unit Holders. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be shared equally by the Unit Holders, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, and, in the case of the Unit Holders, shall be payable from the Adjustment Escrow Fund. The Unit Holders Representative and Acquiror shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records and any work papers relating to the estimates delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 2.3 and the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice, respectively, and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm in connection therewith.

and representatives shall have reasonable access to all information used by
the Unit Holders Representative, the Manager and/or the Company in preparing
the estimates delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 2.3. 

   

 (d) Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after all aspects of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall have become conclusive and binding on the parties pursuant to the foregoing provisions, (i) if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Acquiror will pay the absolute value thereof to the Unit Holders Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Unit Holders Representative and (ii) if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Acquiror and the Unit Holders Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the Adjustment Escrow Agent to (A) distribute to Acquiror from the Adjustment Escrow Fund cash equal to the lesser of (x) such Post-Closing Adjustment Amount and (y) the Adjustment Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement and (B) if such positive Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow Fund, to distribute the balance of the Adjustment Fund Escrow to the Unit Holders Representative in accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement for distribution to the Unit Holders in accordance with the Unit Holders Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, if a positive Post-Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the amount thereof shall be payable only from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and there shall be no positive Post-Closing Adjustment Amount in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Fund. 

   

 Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Acquiror or the Surviving Entity will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as Acquiror or the Surviving Entity is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority.

 (b) To the extent necessary to determine the liability for Taxes for a portion of a taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the determination of the Taxes for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the Closing shall be determined by assuming that the taxable year or period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) To the extent necessary to determine the liability for Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to any assets or otherwise measured by the level of any item, the determination of the Taxes for the portion of the year or period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the close of the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

Tax Period that will be filed after the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to the Unit Holders Representative no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the due date of such return, a draft of such return for the

unreasonably withheld or delayed). Acquiror shall provide timely notice to the
Unit Holders of any communication from a taxing authority that Acquiror or
Acquiror Sub may receive with respect to the Company or a Subsidiary for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Unit Holders Representative shall control the
defense and settlement of any audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to the income Tax Returns for the Company and each
Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Acquiror shall have no authority
to amend any Tax Return of the Company or a Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing

 (iii) for purposes of each Acquiror Plan in which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible to participate and participates in after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Subsidiaries to, (A) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period to the extent such condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was satisfied or waived under the comparable Benefit Plan of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and (B) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Effective Time under the comparable Benefit Plan of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 (d) Acquiror shall be responsible for providing or discharging any and all notifications, benefits and liabilities to Continuing Employees and governmental authorities required by WARN or by any other applicable Law relating to plant closings or employee separations or severance pay that are required to be provided occurring after the Closing.

Furthermore, nothing contained in this Section 5.6 shall require or imply that the employment of the Employees or the Continuing Employees will continue for any particular period of time following the Effective Time.

administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Persons

the request of the Company, any Subsidiary or the Manager, and arising out of
actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions in such
capacities occurring, at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement
right of any Indemnitees (each, a " _Claim_ "). All rights of the Indemnitees
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing as provided in the LLC Agreement
(including under Section 8.6 thereof), the respective Subsidiaries
certificates or articles of organization or operating
agreements, certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of
the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In addition,
the Surviving Entity shall pay any expenses of any Indemnitee under this
Section 5.7, as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable
Law. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Entity, from and after the Closing, shall cause (i) the limited liability company agreement or comparable organizational documents of the Surviving Entity to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of the liabilities and indemnification of directors, officers and employees with respect to actual or alleged acts and omissions by them in such capacities on or prior to the Closing Date than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the LLC Agreement of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Closing in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by applicable Law and (ii) the certificates or articles of organization or operating agreements, certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational documents of each Subsidiary to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to indemnification of directors, officers and employees with respect to actual or alleged acts and omissions by them in such capacities on or prior to the Closing Date than are set forth therein as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions in each case shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Closing in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees unless such modification is required by applicable Law. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Entity shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control the defense of, including the investigation of, any Claim against any Indemnitee with counsel selected by the Surviving Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding __the foregoing (i) such Indemnitee may participate in the defense of such Claim with independent legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, (ii) the Surviving Entity shall not have the right to enter into any settlement of such Claim on such Indemnitees behalf without the consent of such Indemnitee unless (x) any amount to be paid by the Indemnitee is paid by the Surviving Entity 

      ##### 

  

    

(including with the proceeds of any available insurance coverage), (y) such
settlement does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of law
or any injunctive or other form of non-monetary relief binding upon such
Indemnitee other than reasonable confidentiality obligations relating to the
terms of such settlement, and (z) such settlement expressly and
unconditionally fully releases such Indemnitee from all Liabilities with
respect to such Claim, (iii) the Surviving Entity shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnitee promptly as invoices
therefor are received, (iv) such Indemnitee will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter and
(v) the Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement of any Claim
effected without its written consent. Promptly after learning of any Claim
for which indemnification is provided under Section 5.7(a), the
Indemnitee shall notify the Surviving Entity and Acquiror (although the
failure to notify the Surviving Entity and Acquiror shall not relieve the
Surviving Entity from any liability which it may have under Section 5.7(a)
except to the extent such failure actually prejudices the Surviving Entity).
If there is more than one Indemnitee in connection with any Claim, such
Indemnitees as a group shall retain one law firm (in addition to local
counsel) to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct (as advised in writing by
counsel to such Indemnitees), a conflict on any significant issue between the
position of any two or more of such Indemnitees, in which event, additional
counsel may be retained by one or more of such Indemnitees as may be
appropriate and the cost of thereof shall be paid as set forth above. 

   

 (d) Each of Acquiror and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. 

   

 (e) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Closing, Acquiror shall maintain in effect the Companys current policy of directors and officers liability and employment practices insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing with respect to those persons who are currently covered by such policies on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to such persons than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;  _provided_ that Acquiror may substitute therefor policies (including "tail" policies) of a reputable insurance company the terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such persons than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section 5.7(e); and _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Acquiror be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance and if the annual premiums for such insurance coverage exceed such amount, then Acquiror shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this Section 5.7: (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Surviving Entity under this Section 5.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as 

      ##### 

  

    

to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.7 applies without
the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.7). 

   

 (g) If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.7. 

   

 Section 5.8 _Contact with Customers, Supplier and Other Business Relations_. Prior to the Closing, except as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and their representatives shall not have any contact or otherwise communicate with the employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations of the Company and the Subsidiaries about the Company or the Subsidiaries or their respective assets, properties, operations or Businesses in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby without the Companys prior consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 Section 5.9 _Discontinued Channels_. At any time after the Effective Time hereof but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the Closing, Acquiror may provide written notice to the Company of any programming channels which will not continue to be distributed on any or all of the Systems of the Company or the Subsidiaries after the Closing (each such channel, a " _Discontinued Channel_ ").

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters, and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Letters; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror shall be entitled to amend or waive any provision of or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter, or replace it, provided that no such amendment, waiver or replacement may (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Ultimate Parent increases its funding commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter by an amount equal to the amount of such reduction subject to receipt of the proceeds of Debt Financing and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.2) or (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (B) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (C) adversely impact the ability of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. Each of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Financing Letters, to execute and deliver the Senior Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility (each as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and to negotiate all other definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letters, (ii) to satisfy all conditions to such definitive agreements and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iii) to comply with its obligations under the Financing Letters. Acquiror shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of all definitive documents related to the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall give the Company prompt notice: (i) of any breach or default by any party to any Financing Letters or definitive document related to the Financing of which Acquiror and Acquiror Sub become aware; (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Financing source with respect to any: (A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing or any provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing; and (iii) if for any reason Acquiror or Acquiror Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing;  _provided_ , that Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall be under no obligation to disclose any information that is subject to an attorney-client or similar privilege if Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within 5 days of the date  the Company delivers Acquiror or Acquiror Sub a written request, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and any other Persons providing Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions

contemplated by this Agreement if all conditions to closing contained in
Article VI are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that
all or any portion of the Debt Financing to be obtained through the issuance
of Notes as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter has not been obtained
on or prior to the Closing, then Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause, no later than the Closing, the proceeds of the Bridge Loans
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to be used to replace such portion
of the Notes not issued at Closing. Acquiror and Acquiror Sub acknowledge
and agree that the obtaining of the Financing is not a condition to Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing has not been obtained,
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall continue to be obligated, subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI,
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.11 or in any
other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Acquiror or Acquiror Sub
be required (i) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or
(ii) to consummate the Closing any earlier than the final day of the Marketing
Period. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub, at Acquirors sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Acquiror in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any issuance of the Senior Notes as defined in and contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter) or any permitted amended or modified financing (collectively with the Financing, the " _Available Financing_ ") ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries), including (i) furnishing Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and their Financing sources as promptly as practicable with all financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to clause (vii) (Financial Statements) of Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter, other than pro forma financial statements unless Acquiror or Acquiror Sub has provided the Company information relating to pro forma adjustments at least 30 days prior to the date pro forma financial statements are required to be delivered (without giving effect to any qualification therein with respect to receipt by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub); (ii) furnishing Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and their Financing sources as promptly as practicable with information relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably requested by Acquiror to prepare the confidential information memorandum and the lender presentation contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (information required pursuant to clause (i) and this clause (ii) being referred to as the " _Required Bank Information_ "), (iii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Available Financing and senior management, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company), presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Available Financing, (iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and legal opinions reasonably requested by Acquiror, (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain surveys and title insurance reasonably requested by Acquiror, (vi) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Acquiror to permit the consummation of the Available Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Surviving Entity at the Closing, (vii) executing and delivering any pledge and 

      ##### 

  

    

security documents, other definitive financing documents or other
certificates, and documents as may be reasonably requested by Acquiror
(including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters in the form of _Exhibit H_ attached hereto and
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any material relating to
the Available Financing), (viii) providing authorization letters to the
Financing sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective
lenders and containing a customary representation to the arranger of the
Available Financing that the information contained in the confidential
information memorandum contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and, in the case of
the public-side version, containing a representation to the arranger of the
Available Financing that such public-side version does not include material
non-public information about the Company and the Subsidiaries, (ix)
cooperating reasonably with Acquirors Financing sources due diligence to
the extent reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with the
business of the Company; (x) using its commercially reasonable efforts to
permit any cash and marketable securities of the Company and the Subsidiaries
that can, without violating Law or incurring material Taxes, reasonably be
made available to pay a portion of the aggregate Total Consideration to be
made available for that purpose at the Closing (it being understood that the
Company has not made any representations about how much that cash and
marketable securities will be), (xi) assisting in (A) the preparation of and
entering into one or more credit agreements or purchase agreements or
other agreements on the terms contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or,
if applicable, on the terms contemplated by the Available Financing, and
currency or interest hedging agreements as reasonably requested by Acquiror
or Acquiror Sub or (B) the amendment of any of the Companys or
the Subsidiaries currency or interest hedging agreements on terms reasonably
requested by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub; _provided_ that no obligation of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries under any such agreements or amendments
shall be effective until the Closing, and (xii) assisting with the
preparation of the confidential information memorandum, the lender
presentation and one rating agency presentation for each of Moodys Investor
Services and Standard and Poors Ratings Group, a division of the McGraw Hill
Corporation; _provided_ that (A) any confidential information memorandum and
the lender presentation need not be issued by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries and (B) any confidential information memorandum and the lender
presentation shall contain disclosure reflecting the Surviving Corporation
and/or the Subsidiaries as the obligor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no
obligation of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries under any certificate,
document or instrument (other than the authorization letters referred to
above) shall be effective until the Closing Date and (B) none of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries shall be required to bear any cost or expense or
to pay any commitment or other similar fee in connection with the Available
Financing prior to the Closing Date. The Company hereby consents to the use
of its and the Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Available
Financing;  _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries. All non-public or other confidential  information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 5.11(b) shall be kept confidential, except that Acquiror and Acquiror
Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to potential sources of
capital and to rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors
during syndication of the Available Financing 

      #####

information, with the Company being a beneficiary of such confidentiality
undertakings. Acquiror shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse

Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and the
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 5.11, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in connection with the
arrangement of any Available Financing and any information used in connection
therewith. 

   

 (c) The Company shall furnish Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and their Financing sources as promptly as practicable with all financial and other pertinent information with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Acquiror in order to prepare the offering memorandum and private placement memorandum referred to in clause (x) in Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter in order to consummate the offering of the Senior Notes contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter on the Closing Date, including all financial statements and financial data (provided that in the case of pro forma financial statements all information related to pro forma adjustments shall have been provided by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub at least 30 days prior to when pro forma financial statements are required to be provided) that are customarily included in a preliminary offering memorandum for a high-yield debt securities offering (including all financial data that would be reasonably required to enable the independent registered public accountants of the Company and the Subsidiaries to render a customary "comfort letter" (including customary "negative assurances")) (information required pursuant to this clause being referred to as the " _Required Notes Information_ ";  _provided_ , that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has delivered the Required Notes Information, it may deliver to Acquiror a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case the Required Notes Information shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date of such notice unless Acquiror in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not completed delivery of the Required Notes Information and, within four (4) Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with specificity which Required Notes Information the Company has not been delivered.) 

   

 (d) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, upon the reasonable request of Acquiror Sub, to take any action reasonably requested by Acquiror Sub in connection with its strategic planning; provided, however, that (i) the Company shall not be required to take any action in contravention of any organizational document or other Contract relating to it or any of the Subsidiaries, (ii) any such actions or transactions shall be conditioned upon the Closing occurring, (iii) any and all such actions shall not constitute a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty or covenant made by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, (iv) no such actions shall subject the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives to any potential liability prior to the Closing or any potential criminal liability (at any time) and (v) the Company shall not be required to take any action that could reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement or make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtain the Financing) less likely to occur. If the Closing is
not consummated, Acquiror Sub shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company in connection with any actions taken by the Company in accordance with
this Section 5.11(d). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.11(d) to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to take any action prior to the
Closing under this Section 5.11(d), unless Acquiror Sub shall have agreed to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents
or representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by them in connection with such actions.

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall give prompt notice to Acquiror, and Acquiror shall give prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication received by such party from any Government Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Entity or Acquiror, (ii) of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced relating to or otherwise affecting such party of any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) if such party becomes aware of any fact, circumstance or event that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3 not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that neither the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 nor any disclosures provided thereby shall affect any of the rights, remedies or obligations of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub hereunder.

 (a) Acquiror, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing by giving written notice of termination to the other(s), if: (i) the Closing shall not have occurred by the date six (6) months following the date hereof (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if (x) any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1(a), (b) or (c) are not satisfied on the End Date or all such conditions are satisfied on, but the Marketing Period has not ended by, the End Date, then in either case the Company or Acquiror shall be entitled to extend the End Date to the date which is nine (9) months following the date of this Agreement and (y) any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1(a) or 6.1(c) are not satisfied at the end of such extension, then Acquiror shall be entitled to extend the End Date to the date which is twelve (12) months following the date of this Agreement; in each case so long as the party proposing to terminate has not breached in any material respect any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately caused (such breaching party, a " _Proximate Cause Party_ ") the failure of the Closing to so occur; or (ii) any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-appealable, so long as the party proposing to terminate is not a Proximate Cause Party with respect to the issuance, existence or effectiveness of such Law. 

   

 (b) The Company may terminate this Agreement: 

    

 (i) at any time prior to the Closing, by written notice to Acquiror, if (x) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Acquiror herein or any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue as of and as though made on any date after the date of this Agreement, (y) such breach or untruth would cause any of the closing conditions in Sections 6.3(a) or (b) not to be satisfied (assuming, in the case of any such untruth, that such date was the Closing Date) and (z) such breach or untruth is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by Acquiror within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by the Company to Acquiror; or 

   

 (ii) immediately, if (A) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), (B) Acquiror fails to complete the Closing within two Business Days following the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1(b), and (C) the Company irrevocably confirmed in writing that (x) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) or will be waived by the Company and (y) it is prepared to consummate the Closing. 

  

 (c) Acquiror may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing, by written notice to the Company, if (x) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company herein or any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue as of and as though made on any date after the date of this Agreement, (y) such breach or untruth would cause any of the closing conditions in Sections 6.2(a) or (b) not to be satisfied (assuming, in the case of any such untruth, that such date was the Closing Date) and

(z) such breach or untruth is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the
Company within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated either (i) pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(ii) or (ii) pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and at the time of termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (or, if the End Date has been extended pursuant to clause (y) of Section 8.2(a), at the time of such extension) all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have been (or, in the case of a clause (y) extension, were) satisfied other than any condition in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c), then the Ultimate Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds (it being understood that in no event shall the Ultimate Parent be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion) an amount equal to $50 million (the " _Termination Fee_ "). The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2(d) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that without these agreements the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Ultimate Parent fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee due pursuant to this Section 8.2(d) and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Ultimate Parent for the Termination Fee, the Ultimate Parent shall pay to the Company its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Termination Fee from the date the Termination Fee was required to be made through the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on such required payment date (such costs, expenses, interest and the Termination Fee collectively, the " _Termination Payments_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Companys receipt of the Termination Payments from the Ultimate Parent pursuant to this Section 8.2(d) shall, subject to the Companys rights pursuant to Section 9.5, be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Subsidiaries and their Affiliates against the Ultimate Parent, the Debt Financing Sources, the former, current and future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of the Ultimate Parent or any Debt Financing Sources and any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Buyer Entities_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of any breach by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or the Ultimate Parent of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of the Termination Payments none of the Buyer Entities shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that, subject to the Companys rights under the Section 9.5, the Company or any of its Affiliates asserts in any litigation or other proceeding (A) that the provisions of this Section 8.2(d) limiting the liability of the Buyer Entities for the matters described herein to the Termination Payments or the other provisions of this Section 8.2(d) are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, (B) that the Ultimate Parent or any Debt Financing Source is liable for payments in excess of the Termination Payment or any other Buyer Entity has any liability hereunder or (C) any theory of liability against any Buyer Entity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than the Ultimate Parents obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2(d), then (i) the 

     ##### 

  

    

obligations of the Ultimate Parent under this Section 8.2(d) shall terminate
_ab initio_ and be null and void, (ii) if the Ultimate Parent has previously
made any payments pursuant to this Section 8.2(d), it shall be entitled to
recover such payments and (iii) neither the Ultimate Parent nor any of the
Buyer Entities shall have any liability to the Company, the Unit Holders
Representative, any of the Unit Holders or any of their respective Affiliates
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the Companys rights
under the Section 9.5, under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to
monetary damages from any Buyer Entity other than the Ultimate Parent or any
monetary damages from the Ultimate Parent in excess of the amount of the
Termination Payment. While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance pursuant to the last sentence of Section 9.5(a) and the payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2(d), under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance and any money damages, including all or any portion of
the Termination Fee. 

   

 Section 8.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 or 8.2, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability to the other party or parties hereto or their respective Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers or employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in this Section 8.3 and in Sections 9.1, 9.4, 9.7, 9.8 and 9.10 (and any related definitional provisions set forth in Article I); provided, that nothing in this Section 8.3 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement that arose prior to such termination.

 Section 9.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived only if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Acquiror and the Company, or in the case of a waiver, by the party or parties against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or 

   

60 

      

* * *

partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 

   

 Section 9.3 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, except that Acquiror or Acquiror Sub may assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement to any Debt Financing Source in connection with the Debt Financing or to another wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror without the prior written consent of the Company (but no such assignment shall relieve Acquiror or Acquiror Sub of any of their respective obligations hereunder). Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Acquiror, the Company, the Indemnitees and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement other than the rights of the Debt Financing Sources to enforce the rights granted to them in Section 8.2(d) and Section 9.9. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules, Exhibits and Annexes hereto) and the Unit Holders Agreement contains the entire agreement among the parties hereto and thereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Enforcement_. 

  

 (a) Irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of such parties hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Each party shall be, entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other parties hereto and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which each such party is entitled at law or in equity. No party will oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such other order or injunction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the Ultimate Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger if (but only if) (i) all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied (or, with respect to those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, are capable of being satisfied at the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the Marketing Period has ended and the Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters (or, if alternative financing is being 

  ##### 

  

    

used in accordance with Section 5.11, pursuant to the commitments with respect
thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing pursuant to Article II will
occur. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to cause Acquiror to enforce the terms of the Debt Financing Commitments, including by demanding Acquiror to file one or more lawsuits against the Debt Financing Sources to fully enforce such sources obligations thereunder and Acquirors rights thereunder. 

   

 (c) To the extent a party brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action is pending, plus twenty Business Days, or (ii) if such other time period established by the court presiding over such Action. 

   

 Section 9.6 _Public Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as may be required to comply with the requirements of any applicable Law and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties or any of their respective Affiliates is listed, no press release or similar public announcement or communication shall be made or caused to be made relating to this Agreement unless specifically approved in advance by Acquiror and the Company (or after Closing, by the Unit Holders Representative). 

  

 Section 9.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein this Agreement, regardless of whether the Closing occurs, all costs, expenses and Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses or the party upon which such costs, expenses or Taxes are imposed by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Schedules_. The disclosure of any matter in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure for purposes of any other Section of this Agreement to which the application of such disclosure to such Section is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure, but shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or Acquiror or to otherwise imply that any such matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement, unless the inclusion of such matter in such Disclosure Schedule is required to make the representation true. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Merger, exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery or in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in 

   ##### 

  

    

connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the Merger (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the
Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv)
agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action
or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 9.1 of this Agreement. Each party hereto irrevocably designates
Corporation Service Company as its agent and attorney-in-fact for the
acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on its behalf
in any such claim or proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it before the
Chosen Courts and each party hereto stipulates that such consent and
appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Each party
hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof) and that the provisions of this Section 9.9 relating to the waiver
of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim. 

  

 Section 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.11 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of contents hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. 

  

 Section 9.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, to the extent as shall be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
