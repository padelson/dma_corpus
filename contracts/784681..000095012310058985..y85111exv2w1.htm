The Unit Holders&#146; Representative must deliver written notice to Acquiror setting forth in

that notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror shall be entitled to amend or waive any provision of
or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter, or replace it, provided that no such amendment, waiver
or replacement may (i)&nbsp;reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Ultimate
Parent increases its funding commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter by an amount equal to
the amount of such reduction subject to receipt of the proceeds of Debt Financing and the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;6.1 and 6.2) or (ii)&nbsp;impose
new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A)&nbsp;delay or prevent
the Closing Date, (B)&nbsp;make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (C)&nbsp;adversely impact the ability of Acquiror
or Acquiror Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. Each of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts (i)&nbsp;to maintain in effect the Financing Letters, to execute and
deliver the Senior Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility (each as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter) and to negotiate all other definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter and related fee letters, (ii)&nbsp;to satisfy all conditions to such definitive
agreements and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iii)&nbsp;to comply with its
obligations under the Financing Letters. Acquiror shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
provide to the Company copies of all definitive documents related to the Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall give the Company prompt
notice: (i)&nbsp;of any breach or default by any party to any Financing Letters or definitive document
related to the Financing of which Acquiror and Acquiror Sub become aware; (ii)&nbsp;of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any Financing source with respect to any:
(A)&nbsp;breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing or any provisions of the Financing Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing or (B)&nbsp;material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to any Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing; and
(iii)&nbsp;if for any reason Acquiror or Acquiror Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing;
<U>provided</U>, that Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall be under no obligation to disclose any
information that is subject to an attorney-client or similar privilege if Acquiror and Acquiror Sub
shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive
such privilege. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within 5&nbsp;days of the date
 the
Company delivers Acquiror or Acquiror Sub a written request, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred
to in clause (i), (ii)&nbsp;or (iii)&nbsp;of the immediately preceding sentence. Acquiror and Acquiror Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and any other Persons providing
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions

at any time prior to the Closing by giving written notice of termination to the other(s), if: (i)
the Closing shall not have occurred by the date six (6)&nbsp;months following the date hereof (the
&#147;<U>End Date</U>&#148;); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if (x)&nbsp;any of the conditions set forth
in Sections&nbsp;6.1(a), (b)&nbsp;or (c)&nbsp;are not satisfied on the End Date or all such conditions are
satisfied on, but the Marketing Period has not ended by, the End Date, then in either case the
Company or Acquiror shall be entitled to extend the End Date to the date which is nine (9)&nbsp;months
following the date of this Agreement and (y)&nbsp;any of the conditions set forth in Sections&nbsp;6.1(a) or
6.1(c) are not satisfied at the end of such extension, then Acquiror shall be entitled to extend
the End Date to the date which is twelve (12)&nbsp;months following the date of this Agreement; in each
case so long as the party proposing to terminate has not breached in any material respect any of
its covenants or agreements under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately caused
(such breaching party, a &#147;<U>Proximate Cause Party</U>&#148;) the failure of the Closing to so occur;
or (ii)&nbsp;any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
Merger shall become final and non-appealable, so long as the party proposing to terminate is not a
Proximate Cause Party with respect to the issuance, existence or effectiveness of such Law.

been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Acquiror herein
or any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue as of and as though made on
any date after the date of this Agreement, (y)&nbsp;such breach or untruth would cause any of the
closing conditions in Sections&nbsp;6.3(a) or (b)&nbsp;not to be satisfied (assuming, in the case of
any such untruth, that such date was the Closing Date) and (z)&nbsp;such breach or untruth is not

the Closing within two Business Days following the date the Closing should have occurred
pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(b), and (C)&nbsp;the Company irrevocably confirmed in writing that (x)
all of the conditions set forth in Sections&nbsp;6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied (other than

termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds (it being
understood that in no event shall the Ultimate Parent be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion) an amount equal to $50&nbsp;million (the &#147;<U>Termination Fee</U>&#148;). The
parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section&nbsp;8.2(d) are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that without these agreements the parties would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Ultimate Parent fails to promptly pay the
Termination Fee due pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.2(d) and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Ultimate Parent for the Termination
Fee, the Ultimate Parent shall pay to the Company its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys&#146; fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Termination
Fee from the date the Termination Fee was required to be made through the date of payment at the
prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on such required payment date (such costs, expenses, interest
and the Termination Fee collectively, the &#147;<U>Termination Payments</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s receipt of the Termination Payments
from the Ultimate Parent pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.2(d) shall, subject to the Company&#146;s rights
pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.5, be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Subsidiaries and
their Affiliates against the Ultimate Parent, the Debt Financing Sources, the former, current and
future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of the Ultimate Parent or any Debt
Financing Sources and any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent or assignee of any
of the foregoing (collectively, the &#147;<U>Buyer Entities</U>&#148;) for any loss suffered as a result of
any breach by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or the Ultimate Parent of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of the
Termination Payments none of the Buyer Entities shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that, subject to the Company&#146;s rights under the Section&nbsp;9.5, the
Company or any of its Affiliates asserts in any litigation or other proceeding (A)&nbsp;that the
provisions of this Section&nbsp;8.2(d) limiting the liability of the Buyer Entities for the matters
described herein to the Termination Payments or the other provisions of this Section&nbsp;8.2(d) are
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, (B)&nbsp;that the Ultimate Parent or any Debt
Financing Source is liable for payments in excess of the Termination Payment or any other Buyer
Entity has any liability hereunder or (C)&nbsp;any theory of liability against any Buyer Entity with
