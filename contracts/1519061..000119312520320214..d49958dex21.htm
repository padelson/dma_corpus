Re: _Put Option_

Dear Madam or Sir,

 

Reference is made to our recent discussions relating to the contemplated
acquisition of the business of developing, manufacturing, regenerating and
selling activated methyl methacrylates (MMA) and polymethyl methacrylates
(PMMA) (as further defined in the Share Purchase Agreement, the " _Business_
") currently operated by certain of Subsidiaries of Arkema.

 

We (" _we_ " or the " _Purchaser_ ") are pleased to enter into an irrevocable
commitment to purchase the Transferred Shares and the Transferred
Intellectual Property in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in (i) a Share Purchase Agreement and its annexes in the
form attached hereto as _Annex A_ (which form results from our
previous negotiations) (the " _Share Purchase Agreement_ ") and (ii) a
Warranty Agreement and its annexes in the form attached hereto as _Annex B_
(which form results from our previous negotiations) (the "
_Warranty Agreement_ ", and together with the Share Purchase Agreement, the "
_Transaction Agreements_ "), which you may, at your discretion and option,
exercise in accordance with the procedures described below (the "
_Put Option_ ") for an aggregate consideration determined in accordance with
the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms used in this
letter agreement (this " _Put Option Agreement_ ") and not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the form of Share Purchase
Agreement attached hereto.

The parties acknowledge that the Put Option is irrevocable until the Put
Option Expiry Time (as such term is defined below) and further acknowledge
that the Put Option is a _promesse unilat erale_ governed by article 1124 of
the French Civil Code and does not constitute an offer ( _offre_ ) governed
by article 1114 _et seq_ of the French Civil Code. The Purchaser acknowledges
that the Beneficiary is party to this Put Option Agreement solely in order to
accept the benefit of the Put Option as an option and of the
other representations, warranties and covenants of the Purchaser hereunder
and to be bound by the covenants set forth in _Sections 3_ ( _Consultation
Process_ ), _6_ ( _Covenants_ ), _7_ ( _Exclusivity_ ) __ and _8_  (
_Confidentiality_ ) __ and _10_ ( _Miscellaneous_ ). The Purchaser further
acknowledges that nothing herein shall

   

 constitute in any manner whatsoever an undertaking by the Beneficiary or any
of its Affiliates to sell to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates all or
part of the Transferred Shares and the Transferred Intellectual Property or
to be bound by any obligation of any nature whatsoever in connection with the
contemplated Transaction (other than those obligations set forth in this Put
Option Agreement).

_Execution of the Transaction Agreements_. __ 

---|--- 
 

1.1. The Purchaser hereby irrevocably undertakes to execute and deliver the
Transaction Agreements (together with their respective annexes, schedules
or appendixes) concurrently with their execution and delivery by the
Beneficiary on the date and location set forth in a written request to such
effect (an " _Execution Notice_ ") from the Beneficiary (with the date of
execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by the Beneficiary (in
its name and on its own behalf and in the name and on behalf of the Sellers)
being referred to herein as the " _Execution Date_ ") provided that the
proposed Execution Date set forth in the Execution Notice shall be a Business
Day no less than two (2) Business Days and no more than five (5) Business Days
after the delivery of the Execution Notice.

 

1.2. Following delivery of an Execution Notice by the Beneficiary and
execution of the Transaction Agreements by the Beneficiary, the sale of the
Transferred Shares and the Transferred Intellectual Property will be deemed
perfected and definitive subject only to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Transaction Agreements, and all terms of the Transaction Agreements shall
be deemed to apply to the parties thereto and the Purchaser shall be bound to
purchase the Transferred Shares and the Transferred Intellectual Property for
the consideration and on the other terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Transaction Agreements (notwithstanding any failure on the part
of the Purchaser to execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements).

1.3. This Put Option Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the
execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by the Beneficiary and
the Purchaser in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.4_.

Sections and Annexes are inserted for convenience only, and shall have no
legal effect.

of this Agreement, and references to "this Agreement" shall be deemed to
include the same.

Article, Section or subsection in which the reference appears; and

 

(C) except when used with the word " _either_ ", the word " _or_ " may have a
disjunctive and not alternative meaning (i.e., where two items or qualities
are separated by the word " _or_ ", the existence of one item or quality shall
not be deemed to be exclusive of the existence of the other and, as the
context may require, the word " _or_ " may be deemed to include the word "
_and_ ").

(iii) A reference to a specific time of day shall be to local time in Paris,
France.

(iv) A reference to any Party __ to this Agreement or any other agreement or
document includes such Partys successors and permitted assigns.

ou chome_" and " _premier jour ouvrable_ " shall be interpreted by reference
to the definition of "Business Day" appearing herein.

 

(viii) A provision in this Agreement will not be construed against a Party
merely because that Party was responsible for the preparation of that
provision or because it may have been inserted for that Partys benefit, and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties
expressly waives the benefits of Articles 1190 and 1602 of the French Civil
Code.

 

(ix) Any reference to a French legal concept shall, in respect of any
jurisdiction other than France, be construed as a reference to the equivalent
or closest legal concept applicable in such jurisdiction.

(x) An obligation to use commercially reasonable, reasonable or best efforts
or endeavors (or any similar obligation) shall be construed as an __ "
_obligation de moyens_ ".

(d) In the event of a discrepancy or inconsistency between the terms of this

avoidance of doubt, any of the Local Sale Agreements or the IP Short Form
Assignment Agreement), as between the Parties, the terms of this Agreement

determined as bearing upon a given Seller ( _e.g._ , representations
and warranties allocated to a given Seller under _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ or an
undertaking relating to an asset or a liability that an identified Seller held
or assumed prior to the relevant Pre-Closing Reorganization) in which case
the obligation shall be entirely borne by such Seller.

Statement shall be prepared in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_

Allocation Statement. If Sellers Agent does not provide any comments to the
Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) days following delivery by the
Purchaser of the US Purchase Price Allocation Statement, then the US Purchase
Price Allocation Statement proposed by the Purchaser shall be deemed to be
final and binding among the Parties and their respective Affiliates. To the
extent that Sellers Agent disagrees with the US Purchase Price Allocation
Statement or any items therein, Sellers Agent shall notify the Purchaser and
submit comments to the Purchaser in writing within such thirty (30) day period
detailing its disagreement. If the Sellers Agent timely delivers such a
statement to the Purchaser, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any disputes, but if they do not reach a final resolution within
fifteen (15) days after the delivery of such statement, neither the Purchaser
nor the Seller shall be bound by the US Purchase Price Allocation Statement
and each Party shall be entitled to file all Tax Returns, including IRS Form
8594, without regards to the US Purchase Price Allocation Statement. If the
Sellers Agent and the Purchaser have reached an agreement within such
fifteen (15) day period regarding the disputed item(s), or if the US Purchase
Price Allocation Statement has not been disputed by the Sellers Agent as
provided above, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to report and file all Tax Returns, in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Statement (as adjusted
and finally resolved pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_) unless
otherwise required pursuant to a determination within the meaning of Section
1313 of the Code (or any similar provisions of state, local or non-U.S.
Law, as appropriate).

this Agreement ( _ex ecution forcee_)), by written notice to the Purchaser
served on the date set for Closing (without the need for any prior notice (
_une_ _mise en demeure_ )):

(i) to terminate this Agreement, without any liability on the part of the
Sellers, unless the relevant failure by the Purchaser is due to the breach by
any of the Sellers of any of the covenants, agreements or other undertakings
set forth in this Agreement to be performed or observed by the Sellers;

(ii) to effect the Closing so far as practicable taking into account the
defaults which have occurred; or

(iii) to set a new date for Closing (not being more than ten (10) Business
Days following the initially agreed date for Closing), in which case the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall apply
to the Closing as so deferred but provided that such deferral shall be at the
sole discretion of the Sellers Agent and may only occur once, and the term
"Closing Date" throughout this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to the new
Closing Date.

 

(b) If the Sellers fail to comply with any of their obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_, the Purchaser shall be entitled (in addition to and
without prejudice to all other rights or remedies available to it, including

(ii) to effect the Closing so far as practicable taking into account the
defaults which have occurred; or

(iii) to set a new date for Closing (not being more than ten (10) Business

sole discretion of the Purchaser and may only occur once, and the term

2.9 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) Physical Stocktaking.

 

(i) On or as promptly as practicable prior to the Closing Reference Date (but
in any event not earlier than three (3) Business Days before the Closing

Purchaser and the Sellers Agent, representatives of the Purchaser and of the
Sellers will jointly proceed with a physical stocktaking of the Inventory __
of the Transferred Companies

 



34

    

 (other than Inventory in transit or in possession of Third Parties) as of
the Closing Reference Date (it being specified that the physical stocktaking
will only be conducted in locations where the Inventory represents a gross
book value in excess of EUR 200,000) consistent with the Transferred
Companies and the Sellers procedures for the taking of a full year-end
physical inventory count and in the presence of representatives of the
Inventory Expert. The Sellers Agent will provide the Purchaser and the
Inventory Expert with such procedures sufficiently in advance of the Closing
to enable the Purchaser and the Inventory Expert to prepare for such physical
count and in any event at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of
the stocktaking. The Inventory Experts representatives shall draw-up, on the
day of the physical stocktaking, a certificate setting out the inventory
count as agreed upon between the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent and, in the
event of a disagreement between the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent on the
volume of any given item, the Inventory Experts representative will
determine the volume of such item on the day of the physical stocktaking and
enter this information on the certificate, and the determination of the
Inventory Experts representative will be non-appealable, final and binding
on the Parties, save in the event of manifest error ( _erreur grossi ere_), in
which case the Parties shall refer the dispute to be finally settled under the
Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a sole
arbitrator appointed in accordance with the said Rules, and the provisions of
_Sections 12.18(c)_ to _12.18(e)_ shall apply.

 

(ii) The fees and expenses of the Inventory Expert shall be borne equally
between the Sellers on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other hand.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that:

 

(A) the physical stocktaking may not be completed prior to the Closing Date
and, if this were to be the case, this shall not prevent the Parties from
proceeding with the Closing; and

(B) the Sellers Agents estimate of the value attached to the Inventory of
the Transferred Companies set out in the Pre-Closing Certificate may be based
on a Sellers Agent prior estimation of the volumes of such Inventory.

 

(b) Defined Benefit Obligation Amount.

 

(i) Delivery.

(A) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and by no later than on the
date of the final determination of the Final Pension Asset Transfer Amount

assistance of the Sellers Actuary at the Sellers expense, and deliver to

_mutatis mutandis_. The Purchaser shall have a reasonable access to the
documentation and financial and accounting records of the Sellers and the
Sellers Actuary relating to the Defined Benefit Obligation Amount and have
the reasonable cooperation of Sellers and Sellers Actuary as reasonably
necessary to enable a proper review of the Defined Benefit Obligation Amount
Report to be conducted.

 



35

    

(ii) Review.

 

(A) As from the date of the Purchasers receipt of the Defined Benefit
Obligation Report, the Purchaser shall be entitled to proceed, at the
Purchasers expense, with a review of the Defined Benefit Obligation Report
for the purpose of verifying the same. Such review shall be finally completed
by no later than forty (40) Business Days after the date of the
Purchasers receipt of the Defined Benefit Obligation Report. The Sellers
shall procure that the Purchaser is provided with a reasonable opportunity to
discuss, review and reconcile the data contained in the Defined Benefit
Obligation Report with the Sellers Actuary.

(B) At any time prior to the expiration of such forty (40) Business Days
period, the Purchaser shall deliver a written notice to the Sellers Agent
indicating that it either accepts or rejects the Defined Benefit Obligation
Amount Report. If the Purchaser rejects the Defined Benefit Obligation Amount
Report, the notice must set out in reasonable detail the basis for the
rejection. If Purchaser has not delivered such notice to the Sellers Agent by
the expiration of the forty (40) Business Days period, Purchaser shall be
deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have accepted the Defined
Benefit Obligation Amount Report.

(C) All expenses of Purchaser in reviewing the Defined Benefit Obligation
Amount Report shall be borne by Purchaser.

(D) Purchaser shall only be entitled to reject the Defined Benefit Obligation
Amount Report on the grounds that the Defined Benefit Obligation Amount was
not calculated using the methodology plan provisions, or assumptions, as used
in the definition of "Defined Benefit Obligation Amount" above, or was not
otherwise calculated accurately in any material respects. If Purchaser
rejects the Defined Benefit Obligation Amount Report, then the Sellers Agent
and Purchaser shall attempt to resolve the differences.

 

(iii) Dispute.

(A) If the differences are not resolved within a period of twenty (20)
Business Days after receipt of the written notice of rejection, the dispute
may be referred by either the Sellers Agent or Purchaser to an independent
actuary of national recognition that is mutually acceptable to both parties
(the " _Defined Benefit Obligation Amount Mediator_ " or " _DBOAM_ ").

 

(B) If the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent have not agreed on a DBOAM within
ten (10) days from the expiration of the twenty (20) Business Day delay
referred to in paragraph (A) above, the DBOAM shall be appointed by the
President of the Commercial Court of Paris ( _Tribunal de Commerce de Paris_ )
at the request of the first of the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent to make
such request, with each of such Parties having the opportunity to be heard.

(iv) Final determination.

 

(A) The DBOAM, acting in the capacity of a " _tiers arbitre mandataire_ " in
accordance with the provisions of Article 1592 et seq. of the French Civil
Code, shall determine how the differences are to be resolved as promptly as
practicable, but in any event by no later than the later of (i) thirty (30)
days following its appointment and (ii) the date on which the Final Pension
Asset Transfer Amount is finally determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.6(c)_.

 



36

    

(B) The determination of the DBOAM of the matters in dispute shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Parties and the Independent Expert (as the
case may be), absent manifest error, and shall not be subject to appeal. The
scope of the DBOAMs review shall be limited to determining whether the
Defined Benefit Obligation Amount was calculated using the methodology plan
provisions, or assumptions, as used in the definition of "Defined Benefit
Obligation Amount" contained herein, or was otherwise calculated accurately in
any material respects.

 

(C) Once a settlement or determination has been achieved, the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the Defined Benefit Obligation
Amount Report with such revisions as the DBOAM requires, upon delivery of the
DBOAM report to the Parties.

(c) Closing Statement Delivery.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and by no later
than eighty (80) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Sellers Agent
shall prepare with the assistance of the Sellers Accountants, at the Sellers

") in the format specified in _Part 4_ of _Annex F_ , and signed by the
Sellers Agent, setting forth in reasonable detail the Sellers computation of
(x) each of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amounts (it being specified that (a)
the Closing Working Capital shall be determined, _inter alia_ , on the basis

2.9(a)_ and (b) the Defined Benefit Obligation Amount shall be determined in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.9(b)_), (y) the Net Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount, and (z) the resulting Purchase Price, in each case in accordance with
the Accounting Principles.

(ii) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred
Companies to, cooperate with the Sellers and the Sellers Accountants in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amounts and, in particular:

 

(A) procure that the Sellers Agent and the Sellers Accountants are provided
with reasonable access, during normal working hours and on reasonable advance
notice, to the premises and personnel of the Transferred Companies as well as

other documents of the Transferred Companies as may be reasonably requested
by the Sellers Agent or the Sellers Accountants in connection with the
preparation of the Closing Statement;

the same (including the Post-Closing Adjustment Amounts, the Net Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount and the Purchase Price set forth therein). Such review shall

Delivery Date (the " _Review Period_ "). The Sellers shall procure that the
Purchasers Accountants are provided with a reasonable opportunity to discuss
the accounts of the Transferred Companies with the Sellers Accountants.

 



37

    

(ii) Disputed Item Notice. At any time prior to expiration of the Review
Period, the Purchaser may deliver written notice (a " _Disputed Items Notice_
") to the Sellers Agent signed by the Purchaser, stating that the Purchaser
objects to any elements of, or amounts contained in, the Closing Statement
(other than the results of the physical stocktaking made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(a))_ or the computation of any of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amounts or of the Purchase Price set forth therein, specifying in
reasonable detail the items and amounts subject to such objection and the
basis for such objection, setting forth the Purchasers computation of such
amounts and the resulting Purchase Price and providing all reasonable
supporting evidence, to the extent available. The Purchaser shall be deemed
to have accepted any items of the Closing Statement which are not specifically
disputed in the Disputed Items Notice (other than the Defined benefit
Obligation amount, which shall be finally determined in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(b)_), it being understood and agreed that the Purchaser
shall not be entitled to raise new disputed items after the date of delivery
of the Disputed Items Notice.

 

(iii) Disputed Items. Upon delivery of a Disputed Items Notice, the Purchaser
and the Sellers Agent (with the assistance, at the option of the Party
concerned, of the Purchasers Accountants or the Sellers Accountants) shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items, draw
up the definitive Closing Statement and finally determine the Net Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount and the resulting Purchase Price as promptly as
practicable. Any resolution by the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent of the
disputed items shall be set forth in a document signed by the Purchaser and
the Sellers Agent and identifying (x) the items on which they have reached
agreement (the " _Resolved Items_ "), and (y) the items on which they have not
reached agreement (such items, or in the absence of any such agreement and
identification, all the disputed items set forth in the Disputed Items Notice,
are referred to, collectively, as the " _Unresolved Items_ ").

 

(e) Dispute Resolution.

 

(i) If the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent do not agree upon the Net Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount and the resulting Purchase Price within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Disputed Items Notice, the Purchaser and the
Sellers Agent shall each have the right to request (upon not less than two

any conditions or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amounts of financing contemplated thereunder other than the conditions set
forth herein.

 

(d) The Purchaser undertakes (i) not to terminate the Debt Financing
Commitments prior to the funding thereof (or the funding of any "high yield"
bond financing funded in lieu of any portion of the Debt Financing
Commitments), or amend the Debt Financing Commitments to (x) decrease the

the conditionality under the Debt Financing Commitments (in the case of this

or appropriate to obtain drawdown of the available funds under the Debt
Financing Commitments at the latest on the Closing Date prior to the Closing

condition or materially delay drawdown of the available funds under the Debt
Financing Commitments. Notwithstanding anything herein, the Purchaser shall be
permitted to amend the Debt Financing Commitments to add additional lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities.

(e) The Purchaser shall be entitled to replace the Debt Financing Commitments
by alternative debt financing (including any "high yield" bond financing),

of certainty of funds that is at least equivalent to the degree of certainty
of funds under the Debt Financing Commitments, shall provide for the
availability on the Closing Date of at least the same principal amount of debt
financing, and shall not result in any greater obligation of the Sellers
under this Agreement (in particular the provision by the Sellers of
information or documents other than the Required Information), (ii) the
Purchaser shall notify such replacement to the Sellers Agent (with a copy
of such alternative debt financing documentation duly executed) at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and (iii) such alternative debt
financing shall thereafter be referred to as the Debt Financing Commitments

 meetings, expert sessions, site visits and QandA sessions with the Sellers,
the management of the Transferred Companies and their respective advisors. The
Purchaser further acknowledges that it has carried out an independent and
satisfactory due diligence investigation of the Transferred Companies and the
Business, has reviewed and assessed the content of the Disclosed Information,
in particular by discussing the same with senior management of the
Transferred Companies and the Business and asking questions to such senior
management and the advisers of the Sellers. In entering into this Agreement
and the Warranty Agreement, the Purchaser has relied upon its own review

warranties of the Sellers expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Warranty Agreement and upon its own independent investigations.

 

(c) The Purchaser further acknowledges that the representations and warranties
of the Sellers expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Warranty
Agreement supersede any and all earlier representations, warranties or
statements made by any directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives
or advisors of the Sellers (collectively, the " _Sellers  Representatives_")
regarding the Business, the Transferred Shares, the Transferred Intellectual
Property, the Transferred Companies, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred
Liabilities or any other matter referenced in this Agreement (including any
information, facts or matters disclosed in the Disclosed Information), and

Representatives shall have any liability in respect of any such earlier
representations, warranties or statements, including any information, facts or
matters disclosed in the Disclosed Information (and in respect of which the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from bringing any
claim or action against any of the Sellers or any of the Sellers Affiliates
or Sellers Representatives) other than pursuant to this Agreement and the
Warranty Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Warranty Agreement, neither any of the Sellers nor any of the Sellers
Representatives makes any representation or warranty, either express or
implied, of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Business, the Transferred
Shares, the Transferred Intellectual Property, the Transferred Companies, the
Transferred Assets, the Transferred Liabilities or any of the transactions

furtherance of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law and except in case of fraud ( _fraude_ ) or willful misconduct ( _dol_ ),
the Purchaser hereby expressly and irrevocably waives the benefit of any
warranties generally available to purchasers under any and all applicable
Laws. 

(d) The Purchaser further acknowledges that neither any of the Sellers nor any
of the Sellers Affiliates or Sellers Representatives makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any financial projections, business
plans, financial or business prospects, budgets, estimates, predictions or
forecasts (collectively " _projections_ ") relating to the Business or the
Transferred Companies (and in respect of which the Purchaser undertakes not
to, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, bring any claim or action against
any of the Sellers or any of the Sellers Affiliates or Sellers
Representatives). The Purchaser acknowledges that there are numerous
assumptions reflected in such projections and significant uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such projections (and has had in this respect
the opportunity to discuss the same with the management of the Transferred
Companies), that the Purchaser is fully familiar with such types of
assumptions and uncertainties, that the Purchaser is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all projections or forward-looking statements furnished to it and its
Affiliates, advisors and other representatives, and that the Purchaser shall
not have any claim against any of the Sellers or any of the
Sellers Affiliates or Sellers Representatives with respect thereto.

(a) Non-Assignable Items, CoC Contracts and Transferred IP-Related

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, neither this Agreement nor any of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Arrangements shall constitute an agreement to sell, convey,
assign or transfer any asset, claim, right or benefit under a "Transferred
Contract" under this Agreement, to the NewCos, if an attempted sale,
conveyance, assignment or transfer thereof, without the prior consent,

Sellers to obtain the Material Consents by providing any information or
otherwise taking any reasonable actions which the Sellers may reasonably
request and that do not require Purchaser to make any payment or deliver any
guarantee, comfort letter or similar undertaking to a Third Party or to accept
any change to any contractual terms of the relevant agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if a guarantee, comfort letter or similar undertaking is
requested by a counterparty to any Contract relating to a Non-Assignable
Item, to a CoC Contract or a Transferred IP-Related Agreement for which a
Material Consent is required and such request is made pursuant to the
express terms of such Contract, then the Purchaser shall be obliged to give
(or procure that a financial institution gives) any such guarantee, deposit or
other undertaking;

event that the Purchaser (a) consents to a change proposed by a Third Party
and (b) agrees to hold the relevant Seller harmless from and against the
consequences of such change, then the relevant Seller shall be required to
accept such change); and

(C) the failure to obtain any or all of such Material Consents shall not
entitle the Purchaser to terminate this Agreement or not to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby.

not obtained on or prior to Closing:

(A) the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser, fifteen (15) Business Days prior

the obligations of the relevant Seller thereunder or in connection therewith
arising from and after the Closing, excluding any obligations arising from any
breach or any event, circumstance or condition that with notice or lapse of
time or both would result in a breach with respect to any such Non-Assignable
Item or Transferred IP-Related Agreement caused by the relevant Seller.

 



60

    

(iii) If a Material Consent relating to a Non-Assignable Item is obtained at
any time after the Closing, such Non-Assignable Item shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as having been a Transferred Asset effective as of
the Closing Date.

6.13 _Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) Attached in _Annex_ __ _ 6.13_ is a list of certain material Contracts
which are used in the operation of the Business but are not Transferred

(b) During the period as from the date hereof until the Closing Date, the

require any of them or their Affiliates to incur any financial obligations or
pay any costs, fees or expenses) to obtain that the counterparty to any
Shared Contract enters into a new contract (in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser), an amendment to the existing Shared Contract
splitting the Shared Contract (in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the relevant Seller and the Purchaser) or an assignment in relevant part
(in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the relevant Seller and the
Purchaser), in each case, effective as of the Closing Date pursuant to which
the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Companies), as designated by the Purchaser, shall receive substantially the
same services and benefits provided (and, if applicable, will be subject to
substantially the same obligations, terms, and conditions imposed) to the
Business under the applicable Shared Contract as of the Closing Date.

(c) To the extent that any such new contract, amendment or assignment is not
so obtained with respect to any Shared Contract identified as "Available for
Back-to-Back" in  _Annex_ __ _ 6.13_:

(1) to the extent reasonably practicable and not prohibited by any
applicable Law or the applicable Shared Contract, the Sellers shall cooperate
and enter into with the Purchaser with a view to provide any reasonable and
lawful arrangement requested by the Purchaser designed to provide the NewCos
with the benefits, rights, and privileges of the portion of any such Shared
Contract which relates to the Business, including by subcontracting,

the relevant Seller and the Purchaser, until the first to occur of (a) the
date which is six (6) months after the Closing Date, (b) the date of
expiration of the relevant Shared Contract (provided that the relevant Seller
shall not be obligated to extend the stated term of the relevant Shared
Contract, including pursuant to any available automatic renewal option) and
(c) the termination by the relevant Third Party of the relevant Shared
Contract; and

 

(2) to the extent that the NewCos are provided the benefits, rights and
privileges of any such portion of such Shared Contract pursuant to
the paragraph above, the relevant NewCos shall pay, perform, or discharge
when due the obligations of the relevant Seller thereunder or in connection
therewith arising from and after the Closing, excluding any obligations
arising from any breach or any event, circumstance or condition that with
notice or lapse of time or both would result in a breach with respect to any

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that as of the Closing Date at 9am
CET, the Transferred Companies and their respective directors, officers and
employees shall automatically cease to be covered by Arkema group insurance
policies, including the policies listed in _Annex_ __ _ 6.14_ (the " _Arkema
Group Insurance Policies_ "), it being specified that, with respect to the
Arkema Group Insurance Policies coverage written on an "occurrence basis", no
Arkema Group Insurance Policies shall be available for occurrences which take

Group Insurance Policies coverage written on a "claims made basis", no Arkema
Group Insurance Policies shall be available for claims made after 9am CET on

61

    

(b) The Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Arkema Group
Insurance Policies identified as the "General Liability Big Box" and the
"Products Liabilities Big Box" (the " _Big Box Insurance Policies_ ") are
written on a "occurrence basis" and (ii) pursuant to the Big Box Insurance
Policies, Arkema Inc. shall repay to the insurers thereunder any amount paid
by them in accordance with the terms thereof. Consequently, the Purchaser
shall promptly repay to Arkema Inc. any amount paid by it to the insurers
under the Big Box Insurance Policies in connection with facts, events or
circumstances relating to the US Business that occurred prior to 9am CET on
the Closing Date (whether the claim made in connection therewith is made
prior, on or after the Closing Date). 

(c) The Purchaser shall procure that the Arkema Group Insurance Policies are
replaced by other suitable insurance policies for the Transferred Companies
at the latest on the Closing Date. The Sellers shall not assume any
responsibility with respect to the survival of existing insurance coverage of
the Transferred Companies on or after such date and the Transferred
Companies shall not be entitled to any refund of premium related payments
made by them to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates prior to the Closing in
respect of any Arkema Group Insurance Policy.

 

(d) Until 9am CET on the Closing Date, the Sellers will not terminate and will
use their commercially reasonable efforts not adversely modify the coverage
of the Transferred Companies (and, until completion of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization, the US Business, the Mexican Business and the Italian
Business) under the Arkema Group Insurance Policies. 

(e) After the Closing Date, the Sellers shall allow, and shall cause their
Affiliates to allow the Transferred Companies to make claim under the Arkema
Group Insurance Policies for any Insurance Event that occurred prior to
Closing but solely in respect of Arkema Group Insurance Policies coverage
written on an "occurrence basis".

 

(f) If and to the extent that prior to, on or after the Closing Date, any of
the Sellers or any Sellers Affiliate (other than the Transferred Companies)
receives any payment from their insurers in respect of any claim of any
Transferred Companies under any non-captive and non-fronted Arkema
Group Insurance Policies, the Sellers shall, and shall cause such Sellers
Affiliate to, hold such payment for the benefit of the relevant Transferred
Company and remit such payment to the relevant Transferred Company or its
designee as promptly as practicable, provided, however, that with respect to
any Insurance Event related to the US Business, the Italian Business or the
Mexican Business or any Transferred Asset or any Transferred Liability
occurring before the Closing Date, such payment shall in no event exceed the
insurance indemnifiable financial consequences of such Insurance Event to be
actually borne by the US NewCo, Italian NewCo or Mexican NewCo (as the case
may be) subsequent to the Closing Date.

 

For the purpose hereof, " _Insurance Event_ " shall mean, with respect to
first party insurances, damaging event causing loss to property, and, with
respect to third party insurances, claim received from third parties for
indemnifying their damages (with respect to "claims made basis" policies) or
damaging event causing loss to third parties (with respect to
"occurrence basis" policies).

6.15 _IT Separation Costs_. The Purchaser shall on the Closing Date pay, on
behalf of each of the Transferred Companies listed in _Annex 6.15_ , the
amount set forth opposite its name in such Annex (together with any applicable

corresponds to the allocated portion of the aggregate capital expenditures,
expenses and costs of the Sellers in connection with the separation activities
to be conducted prior to the Closing Date in respect of the information
systems (applications and infrastructure) of the Transferred Companies
(collectively, the " _IT Separation Costs_ ").

 



62

    

6.16 _South Korean Plant_. The Parties acknowledge that, as of the Put Option
Date, the South Korean Plant is subject to an on-going expropriation
proceedings whose outcome and timing remain uncertain and that, accordingly,
the South Korean Plant and all associated rights, assets and liabilities,
have not been included in the scope of the Transaction.

(a) The Parties have however agreed to discuss in good faith the terms upon
which the business of marketing, distributing and selling the PMMA Products
manufactured in the South Korean Plant as currently conducted by Arkema Korea
(the " _SK Distribution Business_ ") would be transferred (together with
related employees) to the Purchaser, while Arkema Korea would retain the
business of developing, manufacturing and regenerating the specific PMMA
Products manufactured in the South Korean Plant as currently conducted (the "
_SK Production Business_ "), and the Purchaser would purchase all of the PMMA
Products manufactured in the South Korean Plant by Arkema Korea and would
supply Arkema Korea with all of the MMA required for the manufacturing of the
same, for a certain period of time after the Closing Date (the " _Tolling
Arrangement_ ").

(b) In such connection, during the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Closing, the Parties shall (and shall their respective Affiliates to)
negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing on or prior to the Closing
Date the terms and conditions of:

 

(i) a business transfer agreement (the " _SK Distribution Business Transfer
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which:

 

(A) Arkema Korea would transfer to the Purchaser for a fixed consideration all
of its assets, properties and rights used primarily in the conduct of the SK
Distribution Business (including finished PMMA product inventory, Contracts,
Intellectual Property Rights (to the extent not already transferred to the
Purchaser or the Transferred Companies pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement) and customers list) and the Liabilities related thereto; and

(B) the Purchaser would offer employment to the six (6) employees currently
dedicated to the SK Distribution Business effective as of completion of the
business transfer;

and

 

(ii) a toll manufacturing agreement with respect to the Tolling Arrangement
(the " _SK Tolling Agreement_ "), pursuant to which: 

(A) Arkema Korea would manufacture, for a limited period of time after the
Closing Date (taking into consideration the development of the expropriation
proceedings), the Products exclusively for the Purchaser using its own
equipment and workforce at the South Korean Plant for an annual tolling fee
(to reflect the total actual direct and indirect costs at plant level plus a
total fixed margin to be agreed);

(B) the Purchaser would supply all necessary MMA and shall purchase the full
Product production capacity of the South Korean Plant;

(C) the Purchaser would make available to Arkema Korea at no cost all
Intellectual Property Rights transferred to it or the Transferred Companies
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement required for the SK Production
Business; and

 



63

    

(D) Arkema Korea and the Purchaser would enter into put and call arrangements
providing for the transfer of the assets and rights relating to the South
Korean Plant to the Purchaser upon termination of the Tolling Agreement, for a
consideration equal to the fair market value of such assets (determined on the
basis of the future cash flows of the SK Production Business), with an option
for the Purchaser to be relieved from its purchase obligation upon payment to
Arkema Korea of an indemnity to compensate Arkema Korea for the loss of future
revenues, it being provided that the Sellers would not be entitled to
exercise the put option in case the expropriation proceedings are on-going at
the date of exercise.

 

(c) The Sellers undertake not to increase the production volume of the South
Korean plan above the capacity existing as of the Put Option Date.

required prior to the Closing for the transfer of any Governmental
Authorizations required by Environmental Law, Sellers shall provide Purchaser
with reasonable cooperation in submitting the required documentation in a
timely manner, including by providing any information requested by
Purchaser that is necessary for the submission.

6.18 _Steering Committee_. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date hereof, the Parties shall establish a steering committee, consisting of
one lead representative from Sellers and one lead representative from the
Purchaser, which shall be tasked with monitoring the performance by the
Parties of their respective obligations set forth in this _Article VI_ in

(b) In such connection, after the Closing: (x) the Purchaser shall cause the

(i) solicit or encourage any Transferred Employee to leave his or her current
or future positions within the Purchaser or the Transferred Companies; or

(ii) contract for services with, hire or employ (even in the case of a

66

    

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Sellers or their Affiliates from soliciting or employing (i) any Transferred
Employee who responds to a _bona fide_ general solicitation of employment not
specifically directed towards Transferred Employees (including through an open
recruiting process by way of advertising or head-hunter), (ii) any
Transferred Employee who had ceased to be an employee or an officer of any of

__ _ 7.5(c)_ shall not apply to employees of the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates who would be primarily dedicated to the Business.

 

7.6 _U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plan_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but no later
than sixty (60) Business Days thereafter, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause
one of its Subsidiaries, to establish a defined benefit pension plan intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Purchaser DB Plan_ ")
which shall contain substantially similar terms as the Sellers Pension Plan
in effect as of the Closing Reference Date for the benefit of the Pension
Participants, and such Purchaser DB Plan shall have terms and conditions that
comply with the applicable CBAs, as such terms may be modified by time to
time in accordance with such CBA and applicable Law; provided, that, the
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates may modify the terms of any such Purchaser
DB Plan in order to comply with applicable Law, including any coverage or non-
discrimination requirements. To the extent the Purchaser DB Plan is not
established and effective as of the Closing Reference Date, the Purchaser
shall or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries, subject to applicable Law,
including any coverage or non-discrimination requirements, to modify the terms
of the Purchaser DB Plan to provide each Transferred Employee who is a Pension
Participant a benefit that is equal to the benefits that such Transferred
Employee would have accrued if the Purchaser DB Plan would have been effective
as of the Closing Reference Date.

 

(b) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or such
later time as mutually agreed by between the applicable Seller and the
Purchaser), the applicable Seller or its Subsidiary shall cause the Sellers
Actuary to determine the estimated value, as of the Closing Reference Date, of
the assets to be transferred to the Purchaser DB Plan for Closing
Pension Participants, such determination to be made in accordance with the
assumptions and valuation methodology set forth within _Annex 7.6_ , as
adjusted, to the extent necessary, to comply with applicable Law, including
but not limited to Section 414(l) of the Code and Section 4044 of ERISA (the
" _Estimated Pension Asset Transfer Amount_ "). As soon as practicable
following the establishment of the Purchaser DB Plan (but no later than one
(1) month thereafter), the applicable Seller or its Affiliate shall direct
the trustee of the trust under the Sellers Pension

 



67

    

 Plan to transfer from that trust to the trust under the Purchaser DB Plan an
amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the Estimated Pension Asset Transfer
Amount (such amount, the " _Initial Pension Asset Transfer Amount_ "), which
such amount shall be in cash. With respect to the Sellers Pension Plan, the
date of such transfer is hereinafter referred to as the " _Initial Pension
Asset Transfer Date_ " and shall occur on the last Business Day of the
applicable month.

(c) Within ninety (90) days (or such later time as mutually agreed by the
applicable Seller or one of its Affiliates and the Purchaser) following the
Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the Sellers Actuary to provide the
Purchaser with a revised calculation of the value, as of the Closing Reference
Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Purchaser DB Plan for the
Closing Pension Participants determined in accordance with the assumptions and
valuation methodology (including a provision for crediting any distributions
made from the Sellers Pension Plan) set forth within _Annex 7.6_ (the "
_Revised Pension Asset Transfer Amount_ "). The Purchaser may submit, at its
sole cost and expense, the Revised Pension Asset Transfer Amount to the
actuary of the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser_ __ _s Actuary_ ") for
verification; _provided_ , that such verification process and any calculation
performed by the Purchasers Actuary in connection therewith shall be
performed solely on the basis of the assumptions and valuation methodology
set forth within _Annex 7.6_. The Purchaser shall be responsible for the cost
and expense of the Purchasers Actuary and the applicable Seller or one of its
Affiliates shall be responsible for the cost and expense of the Sellers
Actuary for such data transfer. In the event the Purchasers Actuary so
determines that the value, as of the Closing Reference Date, of the assets to
be transferred to the Purchaser DB Plan differs from the Revised Pension
Asset Transfer Amount, the Purchasers Actuary shall identify in writing to
the Sellers Actuary all objections to the determination within ninety (90)
days following Sellers Actuarys delivery of the revised value calculation
to Purchaser pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_,
and the Purchasers Actuary and Sellers Actuary shall use good faith efforts
to reconcile any such difference. If the Purchasers Actuary and the Sellers
Actuary fail to reconcile such differences, the Purchasers Actuary and the
Sellers Actuary shall jointly designate a third, independent actuary whose
calculation of the value, as of the Closing Reference Date, of the assets to
be transferred to the Purchaser DB Plan shall be final and binding; provided,
that such calculation must be performed within sixty (60) days following
designation of such independent actuary and in accordance with the
assumptions and valuation methodology set forth within _Annex 7.6_ ; and
_provided_ , further, that if such value is not equal to or between the value
determined by the Purchasers Actuary and the Revised Pension Asset Transfer
Amount, such value shall be deemed to be either the value determined by the
Purchasers Actuary or the Revised Pension Asset Transfer Amount, whichever is
closer. The applicable Seller or its Affiliate and the Purchaser shall each
pay one-half of the costs incurred in connection with the retention of such
independent actuary. The final, verified value, as of the Closing Reference
Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Purchaser DB Plan as determined
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_ shall be referred to herein as
the " _Final Pension Asset Transfer Amount_."

 

(d) Within forty-five (45) days (or such later time as mutually agreed by the
applicable Seller or its Affiliate and the Purchaser) of the determination of
the Final Pension Asset Transfer Amount, the applicable Seller or its
Affiliate shall cause the Sellers Pension Plan to transfer to the Purchaser
DB Plan (the date of such transfer, the " _Final Pension Asset Transfer Date_
") an amount in cash equal to (A) the Final Pension Asset Transfer Amount
minus (B) the Initial Pension Asset Transfer Amount (such difference, as
adjusted to reflect earnings or losses as described below, the "
_Pension Asset True-Up Amount_"); provided, that in the event the Pension
Asset True-Up Amount is negative, the applicable Seller or its Affiliate shall
not be required to cause any such additional transfer and, instead the
Purchaser shall be required to cause a transfer of cash, cash equivalents or
securities (or, if determined by the Purchaser with the prior written consent
of the Seller, assets in kind) from the Purchaser DB Plan to the Sellers
Pension Plan in amount equal to the absolute value of the Pension Asset True-
Up Amount. The Parties acknowledge that the Sellers Pension Plans transfer
of the Pension Asset True-Up Amount to the Purchaser DB Plan shall be in full
settlement and satisfaction of the obligations of the Seller and its
Affiliates to cause the transfer of, and the Sellers Pension Plan to
transfer, assets to the Purchaser DB Plan pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.6(d)_.

 



68

    

 The Pension Asset True-Up Amount, if any, shall be paid from the Sellers
Pension Plan to the Purchaser DB Plan, in cash and shall be adjusted
to reflect fees or charges paid or incurred, and earnings or losses, during
the period from the Closing Date to the Final Pension Asset Transfer Date.
Such earnings or losses shall be determined based on the actual rate of return
of the Sellers Pension Plan for the period commencing on the Closing
Reference Date and ending as close as administratively practicable to the
Final Pension Asset Transfer Date. In the event that the Purchaser is
obligated to cause the Purchaser DB Plan to reimburse the Sellers Pension
Plan pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_, such reimbursement shall be
performed in accordance with the same principles set forth herein with respect
to the payment of the Pension Asset True-Up Amount. The Parties acknowledge
that the Purchaser DB Plans transfer of such reimbursement amount to the
Sellers Pension Plan shall be in full settlement and satisfaction of the
obligations of the Purchaser and its Affiliates to cause the transfer of, and
the Purchaser DB Plan to transfer, assets to the Sellers Pension Plan
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_.

 

(e) To the extent any Pension Participants are Inactive Employees, but become
Transferred Employees pursuant to Section 7.11 (the " _Inactive Employee
Participants_ "), within one (1) month following the six (6) month anniversary
of the Closing Date (or such later time as mutually agreed by the applicable
Seller or one of its Affiliates and the Purchaser), the Seller shall direct
the trustee of the trust under the Sellers Pension Plan to transfer from that
trust to the trust under the Purchaser DB Plan the Inactive Employee Pension
Transfer Amount, which such amount shall be in cash. With respect to the
Sellers Pension Plan, the date of such transfer is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Inactive Employee Pension Asset Transfer Date_ " and shall occur on the
last Business Day of the applicable month. The actual amount of assets
transferred from the Sellers Pension Plan to the Purchaser DB Plan for the
Inactive Employee Participants shall be determined in accordance with Section
414(l) of the Code and shall be equal to the minimum amount required to be
transferred pursuant to Section 414(l) of the Code and Section 4044 of ERISA;
provided, that such minimum amount shall be (i) calculated in accordance with
the methodology and assumptions set forth on Annex 7.6, and (ii) reduced by
any amounts paid to the Inactive Employee Participants pursuant to the
applicable Sellers Pension Plan and increased or decreased by the actual
weighted-average investment return for the Sellers Pension Plan from
the date in which Inactive Employee Participant became a Transferred Employee
to the Inactive Employee Pension Asset Transfer Date (such minimum amount
(after giving effect to any such adjustment), the " _Inactive Employee Pension
Transfer Amount_ ").

(f) The Purchaser and the Sellers shall provide each other with such records
and information as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out their
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ or for the purpose of
administration of the Purchaser DB Plan, and shall cooperate in the filing of
all documents required for the transfer of assets and liabilities described
herein. The Purchaser shall, or shall cause one its Subsidiaries to, direct
the trustee of the Purchaser DB Plan to accept such transfer of the Initial
Pension Transfer Amount, the Final Pension Transfer Amount and
Inactive Employee Pension Transfer Amount, as applicable, from the Sellers
Pension Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such asset transfers shall be
made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ until such time as (i)
the Purchaser has been provided evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser that that the Sellers Pension Plan satisfies the requirements for a
qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust which is
part of such plan is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code
and (ii) the Sellers have been provided evidence reasonably satisfactory to
the Sellers that that the Purchaser DB Plan satisfies the requirements for a
qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust which is
part of such plan is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code.

 

(g) The Sellers or one of its Affiliates shall provide the Purchasers Actuary
with information reasonably necessary to calculate the Initial Pension Asset
Transfer Amount, the Final Pension Asset Transfer Amount and the Inactive
Employee Pension Transfer Amount, and to verify that such calculations have
been performed in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
Each of the Purchaser and the applicable Seller shall be responsible for the
cost of its own actuary.

 



69

    

(h) The Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate to file with the IRS, to the
extent necessary and required, proper notice on IRS Form 5310-A regarding the
Pension Transfer Amount from the Sellers Pension Plan to the Purchaser DB
Plan. The Sellers Actuary shall be responsible for any actuarial
certification required in connection with the filing of IRS Form 5310-A.

7.7  _U.S. 401(k) Plan_. Effective as of the Closing Reference Date, the
Sellers shall, or cause one of its Affiliates to, take all actions necessary
or appropriate to cause all Transferred Employees who participate in the
defined contribution Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") to be fully vested in their
account balances under the Seller 401(k) Plan, and the Sellers or one of its
Affiliates shall, make to the Seller 401(k) Plan all employer contributions
that would have been made on behalf of such employees had the Transaction not
occurred, regardless of any service or end of year employment requirements,
but prorated for the portion of the plan year that ends on the Closing
Reference Date. As of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause
one of its Subsidiaries to, establish or designate one or more defined
contribution plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
for those Transferred Employees who participated in the Seller 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing, with terms substantially similar as those of
such Sellers 401(k) Plan (each, a " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "). The
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall cause each Purchaser 401(k) Plan to be able
to accept rollovers (including, if they are current, participant loans, if
any). As soon as practicable following the establishment or designation of
the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall take all
actions necessary to cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept a participant
rollover of an account balance for a Transferred Employee from the
applicable Seller 401(k) Plan that is an "eligible rollover distribution"
(within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code), provided that such
rollover is in cash, but including loan notes, if any, and if such loans are
current, evidencing any outstanding loans to such Transferred Employees as of
the date of distribution).

7.8 _U.S. Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits_. Without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement, as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser or one of
its Subsidiaries shall: (i) maintain a plan or plans providing retiree medical
benefits, throughout the 12-month period immediately after the Closing Date
(or for such longer period as required pursuant to the terms of any applicable
CBA) to each US Transferred Employee who is eligible to participate under the
Arkema Inc. Pre-65 Retiree Medical Plan in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date (and the applicable dependents and beneficiaries thereof) (the "
_Retiree Medical Participants_ ") (upon satisfying the applicable
eligibility, age or service requirements) that is no less favorable than the
retiree medical benefits provided or made available to such individual under
the Arkema Inc. Pre-65 Retiree Medical Plan in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date, taking into account the extent of coverage and the cost-
sharing structure immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that the
terms of such plan may be modified by time to time in accordance with such
CBA and applicable Law; and (ii) assume all Liabilities with respect to the
retiree medical coverage for the Retiree Medical Participants.

 

7.9 _Seller Retained Liabilities and Obligations_. The Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than a Transferred Company) shall be solely responsible for
providing group health continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the
Code with respect to all employees and former employees of Sellers and their
Affiliates (including a Transferred Company), including any dependents or
beneficiaries, and any other Persons who are or become "MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries" (as defined in Treasury Regulations § 54.4980B-9) as a result
of the consummation of the Transaction. Except as expressly provided in
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_, _7.7_ , _7.8_ , _7.12_ , _Annex E_ , _F_ , or _N_ , the
Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) shall
assume and/or retain the sponsorship of and be solely responsible for all
Liabilities relating to or at any time arising under or in connection with or
pursuant to any Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy agreement or arrangement of any kind at any time maintained,
sponsored or contributed to or required to be contributed to by any Seller or
any of its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, a Transferred Company)
or under or with respect to which any Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including, prior to the Closing, a Transferred Company) has any Liability.



 



70

    

7.10 _US Service Crediting_. Effective on the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to credit the US
Transferred Employees with all prior service with the Sellers or any of its
Affiliates for purposes of eligibility and vesting, and for purposes of
determining the level of paid time off, vacation, holiday, and severance
benefits, under each benefit plan of the Purchaser or its Affiliates in which
the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate during the two (2) year
period following the Closing (the " _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ ") to the same
extent and for the same purposes as recognized under the comparable US Benefit
Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that no such
credit shall be granted for any purposes under any equity or equity-based
compensation plan or arrangement or to the extent that it results in the
duplication of benefits or compensation. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to cause each US
Transferred Employee to be eligible to commence participation in the Purchaser
Benefit Plans in effect as of the Closing Date, but solely to the extent that
such US Transferred Employee participated in the comparable US Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and subject to subsections (i) through
(iii) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_. In the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs, to the extent permitted by the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plan
providing group health benefits, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-
existing, waiting period or actively-at-work conditions applicable to each
Transferred Employee and under such Purchaser Benefit Plans to the same extent
waived under a comparable US Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date; (ii) give credit under such Purchaser Benefit Plans for amounts
paid by a Transferred Employee (or a qualifying, covered dependent) under the
corresponding US Benefit Plan, including applying deductibles, co-insurance,
copayments and out-of-pocket maximums, for the portion of the plan year
occurring prior to the Closing Date, as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Purchaser Benefit
Plan for purposes of satisfying any deductibles, co-insurance, copayments and
out-of-pocket maximums for the applicable plan year; and (iii) to cause any
Purchaser Benefit Plan providing group term life insurance benefits to waive
any medical certification for the US Transferred Employees up to the amount
of coverage such US Transferred Employee had under the comparable Benefit Plan
in effect immediately prior to the Closing (but subject to any limits on the
maximum amount of coverage under the life insurance plans of Purchaser and
its Affiliates).

7.11 _Inactive Employees_. If an Inactive Employee becomes available for and
able to return to work within the 180 days following the Closing Date, the
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall offer employment to such Inactive
Employee effective upon the date such Inactive Employee is available for and
able to return to work at which time such Inactive Employee shall be
considered a Transferred Employee for purposes of this Agreement; provided,
that prior to any such date, the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than a
Transferred Company) shall be solely responsible for all Liabilities,
including benefits, incurred with respect to any Inactive Employee.

7.12 _US Flexible Spending Accounts_. The Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cause benefit plan that is a cafeteria plan qualifying under
Section 125 of the Code (the " _Purchaser_ __ _s Cafeteria Plan_ ") to
accept a spin-off of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts from the US
Benefit Plan that is a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code
(the " _Seller_ __ _s Cafeteria Plan_ ") and shall honor and continue
through the end of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs the elections
made by each Transferred Employee under Sellers Cafeteria Plan in respect of
the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect for the
Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing. As soon as practicable
following the Closing, the relevant Seller or its relevant Subsidiary shall
cause to be transferred from Sellers Cafeteria Plan to Purchasers Cafeteria
Plan the excess, if any, of the aggregate

 



71

    

 accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts
made during the year in which the Closing occurs by Transferred Employees over
the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such year from such accounts to
the Transferred Employees. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts from the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts under Sellers Cafeteria Plan made
during the year in which the Closing occurs to Transferred Employees exceed
the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts for such year by the
Transferred Employees, the Purchaser shall cause such excess to be transferred
to the relevant Seller or its relevant Subsidiary as soon as practicable
following the Closing. The Sellers and its Subsidiaries shall provide to the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, all books and records that are specific to the
eligible Transferred Employees and necessary to permit the Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries to administer such plan.

7.13 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Article VII, express
or implied, shall (i) create or confer any right in any Person to employment
or service, continued employment or service with the Purchaser, any
Transferred Company or any of their Affiliates, or any particular term or
condition of employment or service, (ii) be considered or deemed to
establish, amend, or modify any Benefit Plan or any other benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, (iii) prohibit
or limit the ability of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Transferred Company) to (y) amend, modify or
terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement,
arrangement, or contract at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them or (z) terminate the employment or service of
any Person at any time for any or no reason, or (iv) confer any rights or
benefits (including any third-party beneficiary rights) on any Person other
than the Parties by reason of this _Article VII_. Further, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Article VII_ , Purchasers obligations under
this _Article VII_ shall not (1) apply to any individual who is furloughed,
temporarily laid off, or suffers a termination of employment or reduction in
hours or benefits in whole or in part because of COVID-19-related
circumstances at any time, or (2) limit the Purchasers right, in its sole
discretion, to furlough, temporarily layoff, terminate the employment of, or
reduce the hours or benefits of, any employee.

 

7.14 _Limitations to the Transfer of Mexican Employees_. To the extent that it
is not legally possible to transfer the employment relationships of some of
the Mexican Employees prior to the Closing Reference Date, including for such
cases in which a Mexican Employee is under a temporary disability leave
(including sick or maternity leaves) duly certified by the IMSS or any other
situation that makes it legally impossible to transfer their employment,
Arkema Mexico Servicios and New ServiceCo will cooperate to transfer such
Mexican Employee(s) as soon as legally possible after the Closing Reference
Date, pursuant to this Agreement, provided that any costs associated with
such Mexican Employee(s) will be borne and covered exclusively by Arkema
Mexico Servicios until the actual transfer to the Mexican New ServiceCo takes
place, in the understanding that such transfer will be made effective as of
the date in which the corresponding temporary disability leave (or any other
situation that makes it legally impossible to transfer their employment)
concludes.

is asserted, notified or instituted by any Third Party which, if successful,
could give rise to Damages for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to
an Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ (any such claim, demand or
Proceeding, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall send to
the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") specifying the
factual basis of such claim and, to the extent such amount can be determined,
the amount or a good faith estimated amount of related Damages (which
estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim), all with
reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which a right to a partial repayment of the
Purchase Price or a right to be indemnified is claimed, and such available
supporting evidence.

(b) Time for Claim Notice. The Indemnified Party shall send a Claim Notice,
with respect to a given Third Party Claim, within thirty (30) days of receipt
(including by any Transferred Company, in the case of the Purchaser) of actual
notice of such Third Party Claim (or such shorter period as may be warranted
under the circumstances (e.g., in the case of emergency proceedings or when a
response to a notification must be given within a time period in order to
avoid a forfeiture of rights) to permit the Indemnifying Party to exercise
its rights hereunder). For avoidance of doubt, failure by the Indemnified
Party to comply with such notice periods shall have no consequences on its
right to make a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, provided,
however, that any such failure shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party to the extent of any
increase of the Damage resulting from such failure. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, _Section 9.7_ (and not this Section 9.3(b)) shall apply with
respect to any Tax Claim.

 



74

    

(c) Third Party Claim Review Period. With respect to a given Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days following its
receipt of the relevant Claim Notice (the " _Third Party Claim Review Period_
") to make such investigation of the underlying claim as it considers
reasonably necessary or desirable. During the Third Party Claim Review
Period, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach an amicable solution with respect to
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
fail to agree, on or prior to the expiration of the Third Party Claim Review
Period, upon an amicable solution with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
dispute may be resolved in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 12.18_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section 9.7_ (and not this Section 9.3(b))
shall apply with respect to any Tax Claim.

 

(d) Defense of Third Party Claim.

 

(i) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice hereunder, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to retain (at its expense) counsel of its choice,
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, to represent the Indemnified
Party (including any Transferred Company if the Purchaser is the
Indemnified Party) unless (a) such Third Party Claim is in connection with a
Patent Specific Liability or (b) such Third Party Claim is reasonably likely
to result in injunctions, equitable or other non monetary remedies which are
likely to materialy adversely impact the Business or the business of the
Tranferred Companies (if the Indemnified Party is the Purchaser). The
Indemnified Party shall take (and, if the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party,
shall cause the Transferred Companies to take) such actions as the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably consider necessary or appropriate under
the circumstances to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
defending such Third Party Claim (including, furnish to the Indemnifying
Party all necessary information and documentation concerning such Third Party
Claim), and shall refrain (and, if the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party,
shall cause the relevant Transferred Company to refrain) from taking any
action likely to jeopardize or interfere with the defense of such claim. The
Indemnified Party may assist, at its expense, in the defense of any Third
Party Claim with counsel of its choice. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the
Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the development of the underlying
claim. The conduct of the defense of a Third Party Claim by the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to constitute an admission or acknowledgement by the
Indemnifying Party of liability to the Indemnified Party in respect of such
Third Party Claim.

(ii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party (x) fails to assume control of
the defense of a Third Party Claim with reasonable promptness after receipt of
a Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party,
or (y) does not notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to assume
control of the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
conduct (or if the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, shall cause the
relevant Transferred Company to conduct) the defense of such Third Party Claim
(subject to subsection (e) below) in good faith and using all reasonable
means and defenses available to it (or if the Purchaser is the Indemnified
Party, to the relevant Transferred Company) and shall have the right to retain
counsel of its choice, at the cost of the Indemnifying Party (but only under
circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is ultimately found to be liable
for Damages resulting from or arising out of such Third Party Claim). The
Indemnifying Party may assist, at its expense, in the defense of any Third
Party Claim with counsel of its choice. The Indemnified Party shall keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the development of the underlying
claim.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section 9.7_ (and not this Section
9.3(b)) shall apply with respect to any Tax Claim.

 



75

    

(e) Settlement of Third Party Claims.

 

(i) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Third Party Claim which
is settled or otherwise compromised or in respect of which any admission of
liability is made, in each case without its prior written consent.

(ii) In the event that (x) the Indemnified Party (or if the Purchaser is the
Indemnified Party, the relevant Transferred Company) receives from a Third
Party or (y) the Indemnified Party (or if the Purchaser is the Indemnified
Party, the relevant Transferred Company) proposes to make to a Third Party,
an offer of settlement of a Third Party Claim (a " _Settlement Offer_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such Settlement Offer
promptly upon receipt thereof from the Third Party and reasonably in advance
of responding thereto, or reasonably in advance of making such Settlement
Offer, and shall provide with such notice all related supporting documentation
reasonably required to enable the Indemnifying Party to assess the relative
merits of the Settlement Offer.

(iii) At the reasonable request of either the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, the Parties will consult in good faith with respect to
any such Settlement Offer. The Indemnifying Party shall then determine in the
exercise of its own business judgment whether or not to consent to the
Settlement Offer.

 

(iv) In the event that a Settlement Offer is received which the Indemnifying
Party, but not the Indemnified Party, is willing to accept, the Indemnified
Party may elect to continue the defense of such Third Party Claim at its own
expense, in which case the liability of the Indemnifying Party shall be
limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of Damages calculated as if the
Third Party Claim were settled in accordance with the proposed Settlement
Offer; and (ii) the Damages actually suffered by the Indemnified Party (or, if
the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, the relevant Transferred Company)
taking into account the final determination of the Third Party Claim.

(v) In the event that a Settlement Offer is received which the Indemnified
Party is willing to accept, but the Indemnifying Party decides to refuse,
such refusal shall be deemed to constitute an admission or acknowledgement by
the Indemnifying Party of Liability to the Indemnified Party in respect of
such Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable toward to the
Indemnified Party for the full amount of the Damages actually suffered by the
Indemnified Party (or, if the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, the relevant
Transferred Company) taking into account the final determination of the Third
Party Claim.

(f) Access. From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice hereunder, at the
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
grant to the Indemnifying Party and its representatives (including
professional advisors) reasonable access to the premises, books, records,
computerized systems, employees and senior management of the Indemnified
Party (including the Transferred Companies, if the Purchaser is the
Indemnified Party) to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which
the Claim Notice relates. For the avoidance of doubt, any document
or information received in this context shall be subject to _Section_ __ _
11.12_. Except in connection with such Claim Notice and the defense of any
related Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not, and shall require
that its representatives do not, use or disclose to any Third Party other
than the Indemnifying Partys representatives (except as may otherwise be
required by applicable Laws) any information obtained pursuant to this
subsection (a) which is reasonably designated as confidential by the
Indemnified Party. All such access shall be granted during normal business
hours, and shall be granted under conditions which will not unduly interfere
with the business and operations of the Indemnified Party (or, if the
Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, the Transferred Companies) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall not be required to provide access
to any information which it may not provide to the Indemnifying 

 



76

    

 Party and its representatives by reason of applicable Law; it being
specified that such access may be limited to the extent the Purchaser
reasonably determines, in light of the COVID-19 (taking into account any
Pandemic Measure), that such access would jeopardize the health, safety and
welfare of the directors, officers or employees of the Transferred Companies
or the Business and other individuals having business dealing with the
Transferred Companies or the Business.

(g) Cooperation. From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice hereunder, in
the event that any Damage is susceptible of remedy, the Indemnified Party
shall allow (and if the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, it shall cause the
Transferred Companies to allow) the Indemnifying Party an opportunity to
implement such remedy within a reasonable period.

(h) Duty to Mitigate. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts (and if the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, it shall
cause the Transferred Companies to use their commercially reasonable efforts)
to mitigate any Damages resulting from or arising out of any matters giving
rise to a claim for a partial repayment of the Purchase Price or
indemnification under this _Article IX_ it being agreed that such duty to
mitigate shall not include the requirement to compromise any right, to deliver
any guarantee or to accept any changes to any contract. Accordingly, the
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, if the
Indemnified Party is the Purchaser, the Transferred Companies) to prosecute
diligently and in good faith any claim that it (or, if the Purchaser is the
Indemnified Party, the relevant Transferred Company) may have to receive
indemnification or any other recovery (including insurance proceeds) from any
Third Party.

 

(i) Payment.

(i) No amount shall become due and payable by an Indemnifying Party to an
Indemnified Party (x) in respect of any claim arising by reason of contingent
liability, unless and to the extent that such contingent liability ceases to
be contingent and has become an actual Damage; and (y) in respect of any
Third Party Claim unless and to the extent that the Indemnified Party (or if
the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, the relevant Transferred Company) is
under the obligation to pay the relevant Damages to the relevant Third Party
as a result of an enforceable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction,
an enforceable decision of an arbitral tribunal or a binding settlement or
other agreement among the relevant parties entered into in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

(ii) Subject to paragraph (i) above, any payment due by the Sellers to
the Purchaser in respect of any claim made under this _Article IX_ shall be
payable within thirty (30) Business Days following the latest of:

 

(A) the date determined by mutual agreement between the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party or the date of issuance of an enforceable decision
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.18_ (or, if later, the date for payment set
forth in such judgment); or

(B) the date on which payment must be made to the relevant Third Party
pursuant to a final settlement of such Third Party Claim reached in accordance
with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

 

(iii) All payments made by the Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant to this
_Article IX_ shall be treated by the Parties hereto for all purposes,
including tax, accounting and financial reporting purposes, as a partial
repayment of the Purchase Price to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law.

 



77

    

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(i)_, if
an Indemnified Party is required to make any payment in respect of Taxes to
be permitted to contest or defend any Third Party Claim in respect of such
Taxes, the Indemnifiying Party in respect of such Taxes shall make such
payment no later than the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the
date on which it is due to the applicable Governmental Authority.

9.4  _Calculation of Damages_.

(a) Deductions. In calculating the amount of any Damages which may be due and
payable by the Indemnifying Party as a result of any claim brought by the
Indemnified Party made under this _Article IX_ , there shall be deducted:

 

(i) the amount of any indemnification or other recoveries (including proceeds
under the WandI Insurance Policy or other insurance proceeds), net of any
reasonable costs incurred for obtaining such indemnification or other
recoveries, premium increases, and of any Tax chargeable on such amount
including any Taxes which would have been chargeable but for the use of any
available tax loss or relief, received by the Indemnified Party (or, if the
Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, to the Transferred Companies) from any
Third Party with respect to such Damages;

 

(ii) the amount of any insurance proceeds (net of any Tax that would have been
chargeable on such amount including any Taxes which would have been
chargeable but for the use of any available tax loss or relief) which would
have been recoverable by the Purchaser or the Transferred Companies with
respect to such Damages had the insurance coverage of the Transferred
Companies in effect immediately prior to the Closing not been modified by the
Purchaser or the Transferred Companies at or subsequent to the Closing;

(iii) the amount of any reserve or provision included in the Closing
Statement for Damages of the type to which such claim relates but only to the
extent such reserve or provision has been specifically recorded to address any
such Damages; and

 

(iv) the amount of any corresponding Tax Benefit.

 

(b) Subsequent Repayments. In the event that the availability or amount of any
deduction referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ is determined only after
payment by the Sellers of the amount otherwise required pursuant to this
_Article IX_ , the Purchaser shall repay to the Sellers promptly after such
determination any such payments that the Sellers would not have had to make
pursuant to this _Article IX_ had such determination been made at or prior to
the time of such payment.

 

9.5 _Exclusion_.

 

(a) No Double Recovery. Any liability for a partial repayment of the Purchase
Price under this _Article IX_ shall be determined without duplication of
recovery, and (x) the Purchaser shall not be entitled to a partial repayment

extent that the amount of such Damage was taken into account in the Closing
Statement, and (y) the Sellers shall not be required to make any partial
repayment of the Purchase Price more than once on account of the same events,
facts, matters, circumstances or omissions.

 

(b) Subsequent Events. The Sellers shall have no liability for Damages under
this _Article IX_ if and to the extent such Damages directly result from or
arise out of:

(i) actions taken by or on behalf of, or omissions of, the Purchaser or the
relevant Transferred Company after the Closing principally intended to give
rise to a Third Party Claim that would be subject to an indemnification
obligation to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_; or

 



78

    

(ii) the passing of, or any change in, any Law or administrative practice of
any Governmental Authority, in any such case not actually in force at the
date of this Agreement (even if retroactive in effect), including any increase
in the Tax rates in effect on the date hereof or imposition of any Tax not in
effect on the date hereof.

9.6 _Claim Period_. The liability of the Sellers under this _Article IX_ shall
terminate on the date which is:

(a) the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to any
Employee Claim Specific Liability;

(b) the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to any Patent
Specific Liability;

 

(c) the date which is sixty (60) days following the end of the applicable

Liability;

(d) the date which is sixty (60) days following the end of the applicable
statute of limitation with respect to any Former Sites Specific Liability;

unless prior to such date the Purchaser has notified the Sellers Agent of a
Claim Notice.

 

9.7 _Tax Claim for Straddle Period_.

 

(a) Tax Claims. A " _Tax Claim_ " shall mean any claim, demand, audit,
investigation or other Proceeding which is asserted, notified or instituted
by any Person (including by any Governmental Authority) against the Purchaser
or any of the NewCos at any time after the Closing Reference Date in respect
of any Tax for a Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax Claim asserted,
notified or instituted on or after the Closing Date, the Party first receiving
notice of any such Tax Claim shall provide the other Party (or in the case of
any required notice to the Seller, the Sellers Agent) with a copy of such
Tax Claim within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by such Party or the
relevant NewCo of actual notice of such Tax Claim (or such shorter period as
may be warranted under the circumstances (e.g., in the case of emergency
proceedings or when a response to a notification must be given within a time
period in order to avoid a forfeiture of rights); _provided_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not relieve either Party or any of their
Affiliates of any of their obligations under any of the Transaction
Documents).

(b) Defense of Tax Claims. As from the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
conduct (or shall procure that the relevant NewCo conducts) the defense of
each Tax Claim (subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.7(c)_ below) in good faith and
using all reasonable means and defenses available to it or the
relevant NewCo. The Purchaser shall keep the Sellers Agent timely informed
of the development of each Tax Claim and shall provide (or shall cause the
relevant Transferred Company to provide) the Sellers Agent with all
information, documents or access to personnel in relation to such Tax Claim
which the Sellers Agent may reasonably request. The Sellers Agent may at any
time elect to participate, at its expense, in the defense of any Tax Claim
with counsel of its choice by providing written notice to such effect to the
Purchaser. In such case, the Purchaser shall take (and shall procure that the
relevant NewCo takes) into account such reasonable comments and proposed
actions as the Sellers Agent shall consider reasonably necessary or
appropriate under the circumstances in defending such Tax Claim.

 



79

    

(c) Settlement of Certain Tax Claims. In the event that the Sellers Agent
concludes at any time that a Tax Claim could reasonably be expected to have,
if adversely determined or settled, an adverse effect on any of the Sellers or
their Affiliates Tax position or liability, it may provide written notice to
such effect to the Purchaser (a " _Seller Tax Notice_ "), which notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail the analysis conducted to support such
conclusion. In such connection, in the event that (x) the Purchaser or any of
the NewCos shall receive from any Person (including any Governmental
Authority), or (y) the Purchaser or any of the NewCos) shall propose to make
to any Person (including any Governmental Authority), an offer of settlement
of such Tax Claim (a " _Settlement Offer_ "), the Purchaser shall notify the
Sellers Agent of such Settlement Offer promptly upon receipt thereof from the
third party and reasonably in advance of responding thereto, or reasonably in
advance of making such Settlement Offer, and shall provide with such notice
all related supporting documentation reasonably required to enable the
Sellers Agent to assess the relative merits of the Settlement Offer. At the
reasonable request of either the Sellers Agent or the Purchaser, the
Sellers Agent and the Purchaser will consult in good faith with respect to
any such Settlement Offer. Purchaser shall not settle or compromise such Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of Sellers Agent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Marghera Ministerial Decrees from Arkema S.r.l. to Italian NewCo is subject

conditions which will not disrupt normal business operations, in each case
with prior notice of not less than five (5) Business Days to Italian NewCo
specifying the purpose of such visit, which time frame may be shorter if
necessary to meet the demands of a Governmental Authority or in case of
emergency;

(D) send prior notice to Arkema S.r.l of any meeting with any Governmental

Purchasers sole costs and expenses.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that the Required Italian

shall cause the Transferred Companies not to, use any tradename which consists
of or incorporates the "Arkema" name, the "Arkema" visual identity, or
anything that is substantially or confusingly similar to this name or visual
identity (" _Retained Name_ ") from and after the Closing Date except that the
Transferred Companies shall have the right to use, market and sell, or
otherwise dispose of, the inventory, signage, vehicles, equipment, machinery,
business consumables, marketing materials, packaging, or other materials
(including letters, brochures and business cards) and other tangible assets in
the Purchasers possession as of the Closing Date on which a Retained Name is
printed, painted, affixed, or otherwise displayed until the earlier of (i) the
deletion of the foregoing or (ii) for a period of six (6) months after the
Closing Date; provided that such use shall be in a manner which is consistent
with the use of this name and visual identity prior to the Closing Date, does
not create confusion as to the origin of the services and products supplied by

of the Closing Date, it will not, and will cause its controlled Affiliates,
not to, engage in any Competing Business in the Restricted Territory. For the

interest in any Entity which conducts a Competing Business in the Restricted
Territory if such operations account for up to twenty percent (20%) of such

independent trustees or independent managers.

(c) Each of Arkema and the Sellers acknowledges and agrees that the covenants
set forth under this _Section_ __ _ 11.4 _are reasonable and proportionate to
the Purchasers legitimate interest. If any Governmental Authority determines
that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ are too onerous in scope or
duration or are not necessary for the protection of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates (as applicable), each Party agrees that any court of
competent jurisdiction may impose lesser restrictions that such court may
consider to be fair, reasonable, necessary or appropriate to properly protect
the Purchaser and its Affiliates (as applicable) under the circumstances. If
any Governmental Authority determines that any of the provisions of this

Sellers Affiliate. If such suspension is not legally possible or if the
Purchaser elects not to do so, the Purchaser shall purchase the outstanding

French Civil Code ( _Code Civil_ ) and agrees not to make any claim under
article 1195 of the French Civil Code ( _Code Civil_ ) (including in the
event of any fluctuation or change of interest rates or market conditions).

 

(b) Each Party further acknowledges, after due consideration, that there are
no circumstances that cannot be foreseen at the time this Agreement is
entered into which could make the performance of its obligations excessively
onerous and each Party agrees to bear its own risks in relation thereto.

 

12.8 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers
may seek specific performance in the event of a breach by the Purchaser of its
obligations under this Agreement, including the obligation to purchase the
Transferred Shares and pay the Closing Purchase Price under this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of article 1221 of the French Civil Code (
_Code Civil_ ). The Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that such
specific performance would not result in or constitute a
manifest disproportion ( _disproportion manifeste_ ) within the meaning of
article 1221 of the French Civil Code ( _Code Civil_ ).

 

12.9 _Express Waivers_. The Purchaser expressly and irrevocably waives (i) any
right it may have under articles 1217 and 1221 to 1230 of the French Civil
Code ( _Code Civil_ ) to terminate this Agreement, (ii) any right it may have
under articles 1186 and 1187 of the French Civil Code ( _Code Civil_ ) to
claim that this Agreement has lapsed as a result of any other contract
contributing to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereunder
having terminated, lapsed or being ineffective for any reason whatsoever,
(iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefits
of articles 1130 et seq., 1190, 1602, 1626, 1641 and 1643 of the French Civil
Code ( _Code Civil_ ), and (iv) its right to benefit from the provisions of
article 1223 of the French Civil Code and to accept a partial performance of
the Agreement in exchange for a proportional discount of the price (unless
otherwise provided) and, more generally, the Purchaser waives any right to
terminate or rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

12.10 _Sellers_ __ _Agent_.

 

(a) The Sellers hereby irrevocably and exclusively appoint Arkema France as
their sole representative (the " _Sellers  Agent_"), with full power and
authority to, in their name, place and stead, take all actions permitted or
required to be taken by them pursuant to this Agreement, including:

 

(i) receive notices under this Agreement;

 

(ii) receive any payments made by the Purchaser under this Agreement and
allocate any such payment between the Sellers;

 

(iii) deliver any notices, certifications, consents, approvals or waivers
required or appropriate under this Agreement;

 

(iv) amend the terms of this Agreement, to the extent such amendment does not
materially affect one Seller more than the other Sellers;

 

(v) handle, contest, dispute, compromise, adjust, settle or otherwise deal
with any and all claims by or against or disputes with the Purchaser under
this Agreement; and

 



92

    

(vi) more generally, exercise the rights of the Sellers on their behalf under
this Agreement (including the right to terminate this Agreement under
_Article 10.1_ ).

(b) Any act or decision taken by the Sellers Agent in accordance with this
Agreement shall bind each of the Sellers.

(c) References to the "Sellers Agent" appearing herein shall be deemed to be
qualified by the phrase "(on behalf of each of the Sellers)", provided that
the Sellers Agents so acting as the agent for each of the Sellers neither
implies that the Sellers Agent shall be deemed to be liable for any
obligations of a Seller hereunder nor to establish any joint and several
liability among the Sellers.

(d) The Sellers Agent shall not bear any liability whatsoever, to either any
of the Sellers or the Purchaser, in its capacity as agent of the Sellers under
this Agreement, except in case of wilful misconduct ( _faute intentionnelle_
).

 

12.11 _Waiver of Conflicts_.

 

(a) Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies after the Closing),
that, following the Closing, Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP (" _WFG_ ") may
serve as counsel to Arkema and its Affiliates in connection with any matters
related to any of the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to the Transaction Documents, the negotiation, performance or subject
matter hereof or thereof, or the Transaction, notwithstanding any
representation by WFG prior to the Closing Date of any of the Transferred
Companies. Purchaser hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies after the Closing), to waive
any claim they have or may have that WFG has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation. WFG is expressly
intended as a third-party beneficiary of this provision of this Agreement.

 

(b) Sellers and Arkema acknowledge and agree, on their behalf and on behalf of
their Affiliates, that following the Closing, the legal advisors of the
Transferred Companies and the Sellers (in respect of the Business) may serve
as counsel to the Transferred Companies notwithstanding any representation by
them prior to, or following, the Closing Date of any of the Transferred
Companies or the Sellers (in respect of the Business), to the extent that
such representation after the Closing Date does not place such legal advisors
in a position of conflict of interests towards any member of the Arkema Group
which would prevent such legal advisor to act for the Transfer Companies in
accordance with the relevant applicable bar regulation.

12.12 _Notices_. 

(a) All notices and other communications required or permitted to be given or
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing in the English language

delivering an acknowledgement of receipt (such as FEDEX or DHL) or registered

12.12_.

12.2_ in accordance with provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 12.2_, provided
that such notification shall only be effective:

 

(i) on the date specified in the notification as the date on which the change

(ii) if no date is specified or the date specified is less than one (1)
Business Day after the date on which notice is given, the date which is one
(1) Business Day after notice of any such change has been given.

12.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
represent the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with reference
to the transactions set forth herein and therein and supersede all prior
negotiations, discussions, correspondence, communications, understandings and
agreements between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and all prior drafts of such documents, all of which are merged into
the executed version of such documents; provided, however, that in the event
of a conflict between this Agreement and any other Transaction Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall govern. No prior drafts of any Transaction
Document may be used to show the intent of the Parties in connection
therewith and the transactions contemplated thereby or shall otherwise be
admissible into evidence in any Proceeding or other legal action involving
this Agreement.

 

12.14 _No Third Party Rights; Assignment_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as expressly provided herein, none of
the Parties shall assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations
created under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser may assign its rights
and obligations to any of its wholly-owned Affiliates incorporated in the
European Union, Mexico or the United States of America without the prior
consent of the Sellers provided that Purchaser shall remain jointly and
severally ( _solidairement_ ) liable with such Affiliate under this Agreement.
Except as expressly provided herein, nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
be construed to give any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement
(including any current or former employees, any participant in any benefit
plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) any right, remedy or claim or
any obligation or liability under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement.

 



94

    

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Parties
expressly agree that the Purchaser may assign or transfer, by way of security
or charge, the right to receive any repayment of a portion of the Purchase
Price or other payments hereunder to any direct or indirect provider of
finance in connection with the debt financing of all or a part of the
Transaction, provided that under no circumstance shall the obligations or
liabilities of the Sellers be increased as a result of any such assignment or
transfer.

 

12.15 _Severability_. This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other term
or provision hereof. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, the Parties hereto intend that there shall be added as a
part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such invalid or
unenforceable provision as may be possible to effectuate the intent of the
Parties hereunder.

 

12.16 _Waivers and Amendments_. No modification of, or amendment to, this
Agreement shall be valid unless in a writing signed by the Parties hereto
referring specifically to this Agreement and stating the Parties intention to
modify or amend the same. Any waiver of any term or condition of this
Agreement must be in a writing signed by the Party entitled to grant such
waiver referring specifically to the term or condition to be waived, and no
such waiver shall be deemed to constitute the waiver of any other breach of
the same or of any other term or condition of this Agreement.

 

12.17 _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Tax that may become payable as a result
of the signing of this Agreement or the transfer of the Transferred Shares
and the Transferred Intellectual Property pursuant hereto shall be borne by
the Purchaser and shall be paid on a timely basis in compliance with all
statutory requirements. The Purchaser shall provide the Sellers Agent with
evidence of the payment of any such Transfer Taxes promptly after payment has
been made and in any event no later than thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date. Each of the Sellers agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in the
filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including by
supplying information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to
complete such returns.

 

12.18 _Governing Law and Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of France (without giving effect to the conflicts-
of-law principles thereof).

(b) Except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, all disputes, controversies
or claims (each a " _Dispute_ ") arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement including any question regarding its existence, validity,
interpretation, breach or termination __ shall be referred to and finally
settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce (the " _Rules_ ") by three (3) arbitrators which Rules are
incorporated by reference into this  _Section_ __ _ 12.18_. One shall be
nominated by the claimant and one shall be nominated by the respondent. The
third arbitrator, who shall be the Chairman of the tribunal, shall be
nominated by the two party nominated arbitrators within 30 calendar days of
the last of their confirmations by the International Court of Arbitration of
the International Chamber of Commerce (the " _ICC Court_ "). If the two party
appointed arbitrators fail to appoint the Chairman within 30 calendar days of
the last of their appointments, the Chairman shall be appointed by the ICC
Court.

 



95

    

(c) The arbitral tribunal (and for the avoidance of doubt, in this  _Section_
__ _ 12.18_, "arbitral tribunal" shall refer to a sole arbitrator or a
tribunal, as applicable) shall use its best efforts to render its final award
as soon as is reasonably practicable. Without prejudice to such provisional
remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a competent court, the
arbitral tribunal shall have the power to make such directions and any
provisional, interim or partial award as they consider just and
desirable, including injunctive relief and/or specific performance. The
arbitral tribunal shall not have the power to decide the dispute as "
_amiables compositeurs_ ". The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final
and binding upon the Parties as from the date it is made, and each Party
hereby waives any and all rights to appeal or challenge the award on the law
and/or merits insofar as such waiver can be validly made. Each party
undertakes to carry out any award of the tribunal without delay.

(d) The place of arbitration shall be Paris, France and the governing law of
the arbitration agreements contained in  _Section_ __ _ 12.18_ shall be the
law of France. The English language shall be used throughout the proceedings,
but documentary evidence in French may be submitted without translation.

 

(e) The parties shall preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of any
arbitration brought pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.18_ of this Agreement and
shall not disclose to any Third Party (other than disclosure to affiliate(s)
and professional advisers of a party on a need-to-know basis where such
person(s) are informed of the confidential nature of such information and are
instructed to keep such information confidential):

 

(i) any information made known and documents produced in the arbitration not
otherwise in the public domain;

 

(ii) all evidence and materials created for the purposes of the arbitration;
and

 

(iii) all orders and awards arising from the arbitration, except:

 

(iv) where disclosure is required by law or regulation;

 

(v) where such disclosure is required to protect or pursue a legal right or is
required to enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court
or other competent judicial authority;

(vi) where such disclosure consists only of information already within the
public domain; or

(vii) in the case of disclosure by any party to a Third Party, with the
consent of all other parties, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

12.19 _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, each of the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates and Subsidiaries (on behalf of themselves and their respective
Affiliates and Subsidiaries) hereby:

 

(a) (i) waives any claims or rights against any Debt Financing Source relating
to or arising out of (and no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability
for any claims or damages to the Sellers in connection with) this Agreement,
the Debt Financing Commitments and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, (ii) hereby agrees not to bring any Proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing
Commitments and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (iii)
hereby agrees to cause any suit, action or proceeding asserted against any
Debt Financing Source by or on behalf of the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, or any officer, director, employee, member, manager, partner,
controlling person, advisor, attorney, agent and representative thereof in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to be dismissed or otherwise
terminated;

 



96

    

(b) notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting the foregoing, agrees
that it will not bring or support any person, or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their Affiliates or their respective representatives to
bring or support any person, in any claim, against the Debt Financing Source
Related Parties in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Debt Financing Commitments or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts located
in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York, and any appellate
court thereof, and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its
property with respect to any such claim to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court (and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively
do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim
in any such court);

(c) agrees that, except to the extent relating to the interpretation of any
of the provisions of this Agreement, all claims against any of the Debt
Financing Source Related Parties in any way arising out of or relating to the
Debt Financing Commitments or the performance thereof, shall be exclusively
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State
of New York;

(d) irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitments;

 

(e) agrees that service of process upon the Sellers and their Subsidiaries in
any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
_Section 12.10_; and

(f) agrees that the Debt Financing Source Related Parties are express third
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions in this
Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in _Section 12.10_ and this
_Section 12.19_, and such provisions and the definitions of "Debt
Financing Sources" or "Debt Financing Source Related Parties" (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of  _Section 12.10_ or any provision of this _Section 12.19_ or
the definitions of "Debt Financing Sources" or "Debt Financing Source Related
Parties") shall not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in
any way adverse to the Debt Financing Source Related Parties without the prior
written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 

(g) notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 12.19_ shall
limit the liability or obligations of the Debt Financing Sources under the
Debt Financing Commitments or the documents governing any existing credit
facilities provided by any Debt Financing Source to Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

 

(h) For the purposes of this _Section 12.19_:

 

(i) " _Debt Financing Source_ " means each entity that is party to the Debt
Financing Commitments (other than any of the Purchaser or its Affiliates) and
each other entity that has committed to provide or arrange or otherwise
entered into agreements in connection with all or any part of the Debt
Financing Commitments or other financings in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the parties to any joinder
agreements or definitive documentation relating thereto (and any additional
party added as a party to the Debt Financing Commitments after the date
hereof).

 

(ii) " _Debt Financing Source Related Party_ " means the Debt Financing
Sources, together with their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members,

THIS WARRANTY AGREEMENT, dated [●] (as the same may be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its terms, this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and between:

(i) Arkema, a French  _soci_ _e_ _t_ _e_ _anonyme_ with its registered
offices at 420, rue dEstienne dOrves, 92700 Colombes, France and registered
with the registry of commerce and company of Nanterre under number 445 074

at 26-28 rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg

3.2 _Time Limits for Claims_.

 

(a) Without prejudice to any rights of the Purchaser under the WandI Insurance
Policy, the liability of the Sellers under  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ shall
terminate on the date which is:

(i) five (5) years after the Closing Date in respect of any claim for
indemnification in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in _Sections 2.4_ ( _Tax Matters_ ), _Section_ _ 2.15_ (
_Employment Matters_ ) and _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ ( _Environmental Matters_ );
and

(ii) three (3) years after the Closing Date in respect of any claim for
indemnification in respect of a breach of representation or warranty other
than those contained in _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ ( _Tax Matters_ ), _Section_ _
2.9_ ( _Environmental Matters_ ) or _Section_ __ _ 2.15_ ( _Employment
Matters_ );

unless prior to such date the Purchaser has notified the Sellers Agent of a
claim thereunder.

 

(b) Any claim made by the Purchaser against the Sellers under _Section_ __ _
3.1_ which is not satisfied, settled or withdrawn within six (6) months of
the date of delivery of the initial claim notice relating to such claim shall
be deemed to have been withdrawn (and the Purchaser shall not be permitted to
make any new or additional claims in respect of any event, fact, matter,
circumstance or omission which gave rise to such initial claim) unless legal
proceedings in respect of such claim have been commenced against the Sellers
prior to such time pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.14_ and are being diligently
prosecuted by the Purchaser.

3.3 _Payment_. Without prejudice to any rights of the Purchaser under the WandI
Insurance Policy, no amount shall become due and payable by the Sellers to the
Purchaser (x) in respect of any claim arising by reason of contingent
liability, unless and to the extent that such contingent liability ceases to
be contingent and has become an actual liability; and (y) in respect of any
claim made by a third party, unless and to the extent that the Purchaser or
the relevant Transferred Company is under the obligation to immediately pay
the relevant Damages to the relevant third party as a result of a final non-
appealable Judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, a final non-
appealable decision of an arbitral tribunal or a binding settlement or other
agreement among the relevant parties.

 



28

    

3.4 _Exclusions_. Without prejudice to any rights of the Purchaser under the
WandI Insurance Policy, the Sellers shall not have any liability under this
_Article III_ for any Damages resulting from or arising out of:

 

(a) any event, fact, matter, circumstance or omission which was Fairly
Disclosed in the SPA, this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any Schedule hereto but excluding any Updated Disclosure, except to the extent
set forth in Section 3.5 ( _further exclusions_ ) below) or Fairly Disclosed
in the Disclosed Information;

 

(b) the passing of, or any change in, any Law or administrative practice of
any Governmental Authority, in any such case not actually in force as of (i)
the Put Option Date (even if retroactive in effect) (in respect of
representations and warranties granted as of the date of the Put Option Date),
(ii) the date of this Agreement (even if retroactive in effect) (in respect
of representations and warranties granted as of the date of this Agreement)
and (iii) the Closing Date (even if retroactive in effect) (in respect of
representations and warranties granted as of the date of the Closing Date),
including, in each case of the foregoing causes (i), (ii) and (iii), any
increase in the Tax rates in effect at the Put Option Date, the date of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, as applicable, or imposition of any Tax not in
effect at the Put Option Date, the date of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, as applicable.

3.5 _Further Exclusions_.

 

(a) The Sellers shall not have any liability for any Damages resulting from or
arising out of breach of the representations and warranties given as of the
date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date to the extent of any event,
fact, matter, circumstance or omission which was Fairly Disclosed in the
Updated Disclosure, provided, however, that such event, fact, matter,
circumstance or omission shall not constitute an exception to the
representations and warranties granted as of the date of the Put Option and
therefore shall not limit in any way the liability of the Sellers and hence
the Purchasers right for indemnification in case of breach of the
representations and warranties granted as of the date of the Put Option,
subject always to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) In addition, not earlier than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, the Sellers Agent shall provide to the Purchaser an update to the
Updated Disclosure reflecting any new event, fact, matter, circumstance or
omission which occurred between the date hereof and the Closing Date which
renders any representations or warranties granted in this Agreement untrue
or inaccurate, it being specified however that such update shall constitute a
valid exception to such representations and warranties given as at the Closing
Date but shall not constitute an exception to the representations and
warranties granted in the Warranty Agreement as of the date of the Put Option
or as of the date of this Agreement and therefore shall not limit in any way
the liability of the Sellers and hence the Purchasers right for
indemnification in case of breach of the representations and warranties
granted as of the date of the Put Option or the date of this Agreement,
subject always to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

 

3.6 _Local Sale Agreements and Pre-Closing Reorganization Arrangements_

 

(a) Without prejudice to any rights of the Purchaser under the WandI Insurance
Policy, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided under the
Ancillary Agreements (excluding the IP Short Form Assignment Agreement) or the
Pre-Closing Reorganization Arrangements, the representations and warranties
made by the Sellers under Article IV of the SPA and Article II are the only
representations and warranties granted by the Sellers to the Purchaser in
connection with the Transferred Companies, the Transferred Intellectual
Property and the Business and the Purchaser and 

 



29

    

 its Affiliates shall not be entitled to any claim for indemnification from
the Sellers or their Affiliates in connection with the Transferred Companies,
the Transferred Intellectual Property and the Business other than as provided
under and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the SPA or
the IP Short Form Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 3.6(a) shall restrict the rights of the Purchaser and the Transferred
Companies under the Ancillary Agreements (other than the Local Sale
Agreements).

constitute a manifest disproportion ( _disproportion manifeste_ ) within the
meaning of article 1221 of the French Civil Code ( _Code Civil_ ).

 

4.7 _Express Waivers_. The Purchaser expressly and irrevocably waives (i) any
right it may have under articles 1217 and 1221 to 1230 of the French Civil
