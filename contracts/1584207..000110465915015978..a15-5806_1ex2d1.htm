 **ARTICLE 2**

 



 

PURCHASE AND SALE

 



 

Section 2.01. _Purchase and Sale_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees
to purchase, the Shares at the Closing. The purchase price for the Shares (the
" **Purchase Price** ") shall be equal to the sum of (i) $4,250,000,000 _plus_
(ii) the amount by which Closing Stockholders Equity exceeds Base Stockholders
Equity (or _minus_ the amount by which Base Stockholders Equity exceeds

(b) In addition, at the Closing, Buyer agrees to pay to Seller the amount of
Closing Repayable Debt, which payment shall be used to settle and pay in full
such Closing Repayable Debt. The sum of the Purchase Price plus the amount of
Closing Repayable Debt is referred to as the " **Total Closing Payment**."

 



 

(c) The Total Closing Payment shall be paid as provided in Section 2.02 and
shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.05.

 



 

Section 2.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " **Closing** ") of the purchase and
sale of the Shares hereunder shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, as soon as
possible, but in no event later than two Business Days, after satisfaction or,
to the extent permissible, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of those conditions at the Closing), or at such other
time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree. At the Closing:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Estimated Total Closing Payment in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Seller
designated by Seller, by notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not

(b) Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer certificates for
the Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in
blank, with any required transfer stamps affixed thereto;

 



 

(c) Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer a statement
certifying that Seller is not a foreign person, substantially in the form of
the applicable sample certificate set forth in Treasury Regulations §
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv); and

 



 

(d) Buyer, Seller and the Company shall, or shall cause their applicable
Affiliates to, enter into each other Transaction Agreement that has not been
entered into prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 2.03. _Determination of Total Estimated Closing Payment_ _. _(a) No
later than two Business Days prior to the date on which the Closing is
scheduled to occur, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate of the
Closing Balance Sheet (the " **Estimated Closing Balance Sheet** "), which
shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Policies, and a schedule
based on such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet setting forth:

 



 

(i) Sellers calculation of Closing Stockholders Equity (" **Estimated Closing
Stockholders Equity** ");

 



 

(ii) Sellers calculation of the Purchase Price based on Estimated Closing
Stockholders Equity and otherwise in accordance with the calculation of
Purchase Price set forth in Section 2.01 (the " **Estimated Purchase Price**
");

 



 

(iii) Sellers calculation of Closing Repayable Debt (" **Estimated Closing
Repayable Debt** "); and

 



 

(iv) Sellers calculation of the Total Closing Payment, which shall equal the
sum of the Estimated Purchase Price _plus_ Estimated Closing Repayable Debt
(the " **Estimated Total Closing Payment** ").

 



 

Section 2.04. _Closing Balance Sheet._ (a) As promptly as practicable, but no
later than 60 days, after the Closing Date, Seller will cause to be prepared
and delivered to Buyer the Closing Balance Sheet and a schedule based on such
Closing Balance Sheet setting forth Sellers calculation of (i) Closing
Stockholders Equity, (ii) the Purchase Price, (iii) Closing Repayable Debt

 



      
 

 



 

and (iv) the Total Closing Payment. The Closing Balance Sheet (the " **Closing
Balance Sheet** ") shall (x) present the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the close of business on the Closing
Date on a basis consistent with the Balance Sheet, (y) include line items
substantially consistent with those in the Balance Sheet and the illustrative
Closing Balance Sheet attached as Exhibit D and (z) be prepared in accordance
with accounting policies and practices consistent with the Accounting
Policies. " **Closing Stockholders Equity** " means the amount, as shown on
the Closing Balance Sheet, of consolidated stockholders equity of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. " **Closing Repayable Debt** " means the amount, as
shown on the Closing Balance Sheet, of the related party debt of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (not including debt held by any Affiliate of Seller as a
syndicate participant with other lenders in any third-party credit facility).

 



 

(b) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of Closing Stockholders
Equity or Closing Repayable Debt delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a), Buyer
may, within 30 days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section
2.04(a), deliver a notice to Seller disagreeing with such calculation and
which specifies Buyers calculation of such amount or amounts and, in
reasonable detail, Buyers grounds for such disagreement. Any such notice of
disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees
and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing
Stockholders Equity and Closing Repayable Debt delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(a).

 



 

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15 days following such delivery,
use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing
Stockholders Equity and Closing Repayable Debt, as applicable, each of which
amount shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in Sellers
calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a) nor less than the amount
thereof shown in Buyers calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b). If
Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such period, they
shall promptly thereafter cause a firm of independent accountants (the "
**Independent Accounting Firm** ") of nationally recognized standing
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller promptly to review this Agreement
and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing
Stockholders Equity and Closing Repayable Debt, as applicable. In making such
calculation, the Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items
or amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet or Sellers calculation of Closing
Stockholders Equity and Closing Repayable Debt, as applicable, as to which
Buyer has disagreed. The Independent Accounting Firm shall deliver to Buyer
and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such
calculation. Such report shall be final and

 



      
 

 



 

binding upon Buyer and Seller. The cost of such review and report shall be
borne (i) by Seller if the difference between the Final Total Closing Payment
and the Estimated Total Closing Payment is greater than the difference between
the Final Total Closing Payment and the Total Closing Payment based on Buyers
calculation of Closing Stockholders Equity and Closing Repayable Debt
delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b), (ii) by Buyer if the first such
difference is less than the second such difference and (iii) otherwise equally
by Buyer and Seller.

 



 

(d) Buyer and Seller agree that they will and, in the case of Buyer, will
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing
Stockholders Equity and Closing Repayable Debt, including the making available
to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel and (ii)
cause their respective independent accountants to assist, as appropriate, in
the foregoing.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
calculations to be made pursuant to this Section 2.04, and the purchase price
adjustment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.04, in respect of Closing
Stockholders Equity is only meant to reflect changes in stockholders equity of
the Company and its Subsidiaries from the Balance Sheet Date to the date of
the Closing Balance Sheet as determined in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. Neither Section 2.04 nor Section 2.05 is intended to be used to
adjust for claims that may be made with respect to the Balance Sheet or any
inconsistencies between the Balance Sheet or the Accounting Policies, on the
one hand, and GAAP, on the other, for which Article 11 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy.

 



 

Section 2.05. _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. (a) If the Estimated Total
Closing Payment exceeds the Final Total Closing Payment, Seller shall pay to
Buyer, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest
as provided in Section 2.05(b), the amount of such excess. If the Final Total
Closing Payment exceeds the Estimated Total Closing Payment, Buyer shall pay
to Seller, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.05(b), the
amount of such excess. " **Final Total Closing Payment** " means the Total
Closing Payment based on Final Closing Stockholders Equity and Final Closing
Repayable Debt. " **Final Closing Stockholders Equity** " and " **Final
Closing Repayable Debt** " mean Closing Stockholders Equity and Closing
Repayable Debt, respectively, (i) as shown in Sellers calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 2.04(a), if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto
is duly and timely delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b); or (ii) if such a
notice of disagreement is so delivered, (A) as agreed by Buyer and Seller
pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown
in the independent accountants calculation delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(c); _provided_ that in no event shall Final Closing Stockholders Equity
or Final Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Repayable Debt be more than Sellers calculation of Closing Stockholders
Equity or Closing Repayable Debt, as the case may be, delivered pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) or less than Buyers calculation of Closing Stockholders
Equity or Closing Repayable Debt, as the case may be, delivered pursuant to
Section 2.04(b).

 



 

(b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.05(a) shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within 10 days after the Final Total Closing Payment
has been determined by delivery by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, of a
certified or official bank check payable in immediately available funds to the
other party or by causing such payments to be credited to such account of such
other party as may be designated by such other party. The amount of any
payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall bear interest from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per
annum equal to the prime rate as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ ,
_Eastern Edition_ in effect from time to time during the period from the
Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the
same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on
the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

 



 

Section 2.06. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement the amounts required
to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. Any amounts so withheld shall be
paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. Buyer shall notify Seller, and
Seller shall notify Buyer, as the case may be, as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in any event shall use commercially reasonable efforts to so
notify no less than ten Business Days prior to the Closing or other time for
payment, as applicable) if Buyer or Seller, as applicable, determines that any
deduction or withholding will be required; _provided_ that no failure of
either party to so notify the other shall affect the first partys authority
to withhold any amounts otherwise permitted to be withheld under this Section
2.06.

are in on the Closing Date based upon its own inspection, examination and
determination with respect thereto as to all matters, and without reliance

unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Seller and its Affiliates,

foregoing, Buyer shall not have access to personnel records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other information which in Sellers good faith opinion is

"Citigroup", "Citicorp", "CitiFinancial, "EquityPlus", the "Arc Design" mark
that appears as part of the Citi and Citibank logos, the Blue Wave or any
other marks, names, logos, domain names or trade dress of Seller and its
Affiliates or any marks, names, logos, domain names or trade dress derivative
thereof or confusingly similar thereto (collectively, the " **Citi Marks** ");
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 6.01 shall prevent the Company or its
Subsidiaries or servicers from, in a manner that would not constitute
infringement or passing off of any Citi Mark, (A) providing to third parties
documents and correspondence pertaining to the Company Loans (the " **Loan
Documents** ") to the extent reasonably necessary in order to service, or
enforce rights with respect to, the Company Loans or (B) referencing the legal
names or doing-business-as names of Seller or its Affiliates that appear in
the Loan Documents solely in order to describe or refer to the sale of the
Shares to Buyer (including reference to the Company Loans as formerly owned or
serviced by Seller or its Affiliates) in any communications with Obligors or
other third parties related strictly to the Company Loans as the Company or
its Subsidiaries or servicers in their reasonable judgment deem necessary or
advisable.

 



 

Section 6.02. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_ _. _(a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and
agrees to cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to waive and not to
assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the " **Post-Closing Representation** "),
of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, employee or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (any such Person, a "
**Designated Person** ") in any matter involving this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, by any legal counsel
currently representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
thereby (the " **Current Representation** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries to waive and not to assert, any attorney-client privilege
with respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any Designated
Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any
Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with
Buyer, and following the Closing, with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
it being the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to such
attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall
be retained by Seller and its Affiliates; _provided_ that the foregoing waiver
and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
thereby, or to communications with any Person other than the Designated
Persons and their advisers.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Seller Guarantees_ _. _(a) As soon as practicable after the
Closing, but in no event later than 90 days after the Closing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (with the reasonable
cooperation of Seller and its Affiliates) use its and their reasonable best
efforts to obtain the termination of, and have Seller and its Affiliates
released from, any and all obligations arising under, any and all guarantees,
keepwells, letters of credit, indemnity or contribution agreements, support
agreements, statements of support, insurance surety bonds or other similar
agreements made by Seller or its Affiliates in respect of the obligations of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any Company Employees (each, a
" **Seller Guarantee** "). For the avoidance of doubt, such efforts shall
include an offer by Buyer (or, with Sellers consent, an Affiliate of Buyer)
to substitute its own obligations for those of Seller and its Affiliates under
any Seller Guarantee on no less favorable terms (including letters of credit
and guarantees as needed). Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that, to
the knowledge of Seller, Section 6.03(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
lists each Seller Guarantee in effect as of the date hereof.

 



 

(b) To the extent the beneficiary or counterparty under any Seller Guarantee
does not accept any such guarantee or other obligation proffered by Buyer (or,
with Sellers consent, an Affiliate of Buyer), from and after the Closing,
Buyer and its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
and its Subsidiaries) shall not renew, extend the terms of, or increase any
obligations covered by any such Seller Guarantee without either (i) securing
the release of Seller and its Affiliates from such Seller Guarantee in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller or (ii) obtaining an
acknowledgement in writing (in a form and in substance reasonably satisfactory
to Seller) from the beneficiary or counterparty under any such Seller
Guarantee, for the benefit of Seller and its Affiliates, as the case may be,
that such Seller Guarantee shall not cover any such renewed, extended or
increased obligations.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, pay,

 



      
 

 



 

perform and discharge fully all the obligations or other liabilities of Seller
and its Affiliates under any Seller Guarantee.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Previously Sold Receivables_. Until July 24, 2016, Buyer shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to specifically target Obligors
under the Loans sold pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as
of July 18, 2013, between Seller and CVI Loan Trust I with OneMain product
offerings; _provided_ that the foregoing will not restrict or preclude (i)
credit risk management or modeling activities or analyses with respect to any
such data or (ii) any general solicitation of customers based on generalized
lists not targeted at such Obligors.

after consulting with, and considering

(iv) not participate or agree to participate in any meeting or substantive
discussion (including any discussion relating to the antitrust merits, any

the Closing from Governmental Authorities.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or other Person relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby or regulatory filings under applicable
Regulatory Law subject to the provisions of Section 7.01(a), Section 7.01(b),
Section 7.01(d) and Section 7.01(e) and provided that Buyer shall consult
with, and consider in good faith the views of, Seller throughout the antitrust

be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction, or any other Person,
may assert under Regulatory Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the impact of, each and every
impediment under Regulatory Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later
than the date determined in accordance with Section 12.01(b) (as it may be
extended pursuant to the provisions of Section 12.01(b), the " **Termination
Date** ")); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement
requires Buyer, Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take, or
cause to be taken, any Antitrust Action with respect to any of the assets,
businesses or product lines of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or any combination thereof, if such action
would exceed the Detriment Limit. For purposes of this Agreement, "
**Antitrust Action** " means any action with respect to assets, businesses or
product lines of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any combination thereof, including a request that they be
(x) divested, licensed or held separate (including by establishing a trust or
otherwise) or (y) subject to conduct remedies, limitations or other actions
(including pursuant to any settlement, undertaking, consent decree,
stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Authority) (and that any
divestiture include the opportunity to hire employees associated with the
applicable assets or businesses), and the " **Detriment Limit** " would be
exceeded if the assets, businesses or product lines to be divested, licensed
or held separate pursuant to Antitrust Action in order to obtain actions or
nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, clearances, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities
under Regulatory Laws account for more than $677,000,000 of aggregate revenue
for the twelve (12) months ended December 31, 2014 (it being understood and
agreed that any Intellectual Property Rights required by Governmental
Authorities to be licensed to third parties in connection with a required
Antitrust Action that is a divestiture of assets (other than Intellectual
Property Rights) within the Detriment Limit shall not be considered "divested"
for purposes of this definition of "Detriment Limit"). If requested by Buyer,
the Seller will, and will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, agree to
and take any action contemplated by this Section 7.01(d), _provided_ that the
consummation of any divestiture or the effectiveness of any other remedy is
conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing agreement in this section is made solely to facilitate the Closing
and does not constitute a representation or admission that the transactions
contemplated hereby, if consummated without any modification, would violate
any Regulatory Laws or that agreeing to any divestitures, hold separate
conditions or other restrictions permitted herein or suggested by any Person
or authority acting under any Regulatory Law would not be harmful to the
parties hereto.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
the next sentence, Buyer (i) shall have the right, but not the obligation,
during the twelve-month period following the date hereof to oppose or refuse
to consent to, through litigation or otherwise, any request, attempt or demand
by any Governmental Authority or other Person for any divestiture, hold
separate condition or any other restriction with respect to any assets,
businesses or product lines of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, if Buyer exercises such right, then neither
Buyer nor Seller may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(b)
prior to the date that is six (6) months after such litigation or other
opposition has concluded; _provided, further_ , that, after such twelve-month
period, Buyer shall promptly consent to any such request, attempt or demand
that is ongoing and does not exceed the Detriment Limit, (ii) shall have the
obligation to oppose, through litigation or otherwise, any request, attempt or
demand by any Governmental Authority or other Person for any divestiture, hold
separate condition or any other restriction with respect to any assets,
businesses or product lines of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries that exceeds the Detriment Limit if Buyer refuses to consent to
any such request, attempt or demand unless Buyer and Seller agree in good
faith in writing that Buyers opposition to such request, attempt or demand
does not have a likelihood of success on the merits; _provided_ that, if (A)
Buyer asserts in good faith that Buyers opposition to such request, attempt
or demand does not have a likelihood of success on the merits but Seller does
not so agree and (B) Buyers opposition to such request, attempt or demand
does not succeed on the merits and this Agreement is terminated, then Seller
shall promptly reimburse Buyer for fifty percent (50%) of Buyers documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in opposing such request, attempt or demand
and (iii) shall have the obligation to defend any litigation instituted by a
Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the legality of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under applicable Regulatory Laws.
In the event Buyer opposes or refuses to consent to, through litigation or
otherwise, including any appeals, any request, attempt or demand by any
Governmental Authority or other Person as provided in the preceding sentence,
and (i) such proceedings would be reasonably likely to conclude prior to the
Termination Date with a decree, injunction or order restricting or prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) no
decree, order or injunction would be reasonably likely to be issued in such
proceedings prior to the Termination Date, then Buyer shall take such actions
(including Antitrust Actions) in a timely manner, as are necessary to achieve

condition set forth in Section 10.01(a) and Section 10.01(b) (with respect to

the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other
federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Applicable Laws, including any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation laws, that are designed or intended
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall cause FIG and its controlled Affiliates to comply with the
obligations set forth in Section 7.01(a)-(b) as if they were parties to this

including a request that they be (x) divested, licensed or held separate

to make payment of the Purchase Price and the Buyer Transaction Expenses.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall not enter into
any transaction, amend or waive any term or provision of any existing
committed financing lines or facilities or take any other action, in each case
if such action would reasonably be expected to cause Buyers Available Funds,
at any time prior to the Closing, to be less than an amount sufficient to
enable it to make payment of the Purchase Price and the Buyer Transaction
Expenses. If, at any time prior to the Closing, any circumstance arises that
would reasonably be expected to make Buyers Available Funds not sufficient to
enable it to make payment of the Purchase Price and the Buyer Transaction
Expenses, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of such deficiency.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, each of Seller and the Company shall, and shall
cause the Companys officers, senior executives and finance-related employees,

one or more debt or equity capital markets transactions), or (ii) any offer to
purchase or amend any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries outstanding debt
or financing facilities, in each case, as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such cooperation
shall include:

 



       
 

 



 

(1) participation by members of management of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in a reasonable number of meetings, conference calls, presentations and road
shows and other marketing efforts; (2) assisting Buyer and its Representatives

(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include (A) all customary historical
financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is reasonably
available to or readily obtainable by the Company that is required by
Regulation S-X, including for the time periods required by Rule 3-05, but
excluding information required by Rule 3-10 and Rule 3-16, and Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act for a registered offering or in the case of a 144A

extent so required and (B) all customary information and data that would be
necessary for any financing sources to receive customary "comfort" letters
from the independent accountants of the Company); (5) cooperating with Buyer
in the negotiation of any agreements; (6) requesting consents of the Companys

offering or other materials; (7) facilitating all necessary organizational

documentation and other information about each of the Seller and the Company

applicable regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 and (10)
cooperating with Buyers and its Representatives requests for due diligence,
including participation by senior management of the Company in conference
calls, to the extent customary and reasonable. Seller hereby consents to the
use of the Companys logos on documentation used to solicit any proposed
financing; provided that the logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage Seller or the Company and
its Subsidiaries or the reputation or the goodwill of Seller or the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and provided that Seller or Company provides its prior
written approval

 



      
 

 



 

concerning such use, such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any
outstanding indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified
by Buyer in writing at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date to be repaid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) the Seller shall (or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to) deliver all notices and take other actions required to

or other representative on behalf of such Persons) which Payoff Letters shall
(x) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all
principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs or other
outstanding and unpaid obligations related to such indebtedness as of the
Closing Date (the " **Payoff Amount** ") and (y) state that all obligations
(including guarantees) in respect thereof and Liens in connection therewith on
the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise on the
Companys business shall be, substantially concurrently with the receipt of
the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date by the Persons holding such
indebtedness, released or arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Buyer for
such release shall have been made by such time, subject, as applicable, to the
replacement (or cash collateralization or backstopping) of any then
outstanding letters of credit or similar indebtedness. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) nothing in this Section 7.02(b) shall require cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) the foregoing will be subject to any
applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, and neither Seller nor the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into any
agreement or commitment with respect to any financing or offer to purchase or
amend contemplated by this Section 7.02(b) or take any action (including the
entry into any agreement) that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that would be effective prior
to the Closing and no personal liability shall be imposed on the officers or
employees involved.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates,
including the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective

including the Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer shall, promptly upon
Sellers request, reimburse Seller and its Affiliates, including the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and their

 



      
 

 



 

respective Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with this Section 7.02.

 



 

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of any financing is not a
condition to Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independent of
the availability of any financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 10.

 



 

Section 7.03. _Public Announcements_. The parties agree to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except
for any press releases and public announcements the making of which may be
required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or requested by any Governmental Authority, will not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party.

 



 

Section 7.04. _Intercompany Accounts and Agreements_ _._ Except as
contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement and Reverse Transition
Services Agreements, all intercompany accounts and agreements between Seller
or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its

the Company or its Subsidiaries to Seller or its Affiliate from time to time
under the Citigroup Tax Sharing Agreement, as reflected in the "Income taxes
payable" line item included in the Balance Sheet) shall be settled
(irrespective of the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts) and paid
in full in cash or terminated, as applicable, at or prior to the Closing,
except for (a) any intercompany accounts arising under any intercompany
agreement set forth on Section 7.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule which
accounts will be settled in accordance with the terms of the applicable
intercompany agreement and (b) any intercompany agreement set forth on Section
7.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which shall remain in full force and

of five (5) years after the Closing Date, or for such longer period of time as
may be required by Applicable Law, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer, the Company
and its Subsidiaries) to, (i) maintain its books of account, financial and
other records (including accountants work papers) and information relating to
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any shared or
commingled books and

 



      
 

 



 

records resulting from Sellers historical relationship with the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to the extent related to the period prior to Closing and
(ii) subject to Applicable Law and subject to any applicable privileges
(including the attorney-client privilege) and confidentiality obligations

and its Representatives reasonable access to its books of account, financial
and other records (including accountants work papers, subject to accountants
consent and to the execution of customary non-reliance letters), information,
employees and auditors relating to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent related to the period prior to Closing (including
any shared or commingled books and records resulting from Sellers historical
relationship with the Company and its Subsidiaries) to the extent reasonably
required for such party in connection with any reasonable business purpose
(which shall not include any dispute between the parties); _provided_ that any
such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the business of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, as applicable. The accessing party shall bear all of the out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees, but excluding
reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee benefits) reasonably
incurred in connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any information or access requested constitutes business or trade secrets of a
party or its Affiliates or is subject to any applicable privileges (including
the attorney-client privilege) or confidentiality obligations (whether
contractual, statutory or other), or if providing such information or access
would violate Applicable Law (in each case, as determined by the requested
party in good faith), the requested party will work in good faith with the
requesting party to develop mutually acceptable alternatives to providing such
information or access, if any such alternatives can be developed reasonably,
in order to assist the requesting party in providing such access and
information.

 



 

(b) Without limiting Section 7.05(a), for a period of five (5) years after the
Closing Date, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
to make available to the other party and its Representatives the employees,
including in-house counsel, of, with respect to Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and with respect to Seller, Seller and its Affiliates, to the
extent reasonably necessary or useful for the requesting party or its
Affiliates in connection with any litigation or any regulatory or
administrative matters or proceedings relating to the period prior to Closing
in which the requesting party or any of its Affiliates may from time to time
be involved. Such availability shall include, in connection with any such
matters, such persons consulting with the requesting party and its
Representatives, serving as witnesses and providing such other assistance as
may be reasonably requested by the requesting party and its Representatives.
The requesting party shall bear all of out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees, but excluding reimbursement for general

 



      
 

 



 

overhead, salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection
with the foregoing.

 



 

(c) In addition to the foregoing, Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered
to Buyer at, or promptly after, the Closing all books, records and other
documents (or copies thereof) relating to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or, in the case of books, records or other documents that relate
to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and to matters unrelated
to the such business, shall deliver or cause to be delivered copies of all
books, records or other documents to the extent relating to the business of
the Company and its subsidiaries) that are not in the possession of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing and that are reasonably
necessary to the continuing operation of the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Without limiting Section 7.10, this Section 7.05 shall not apply to, and
shall not create any rights or obligations of Buyer, Seller or the Company
with respect to, any historical data originated by the CitiFinancial, North

of credit) in Canada (the " **Competitive CitiFinancial Canada Business** ");
or

 



 

(ii) solicit for employment or employ any employee of CitiFinancial Canada or

a period of three months prior to the date such persons were first solicited

CitiFinancial Canada or CitiFinancial Servicing is terminated by CitiFinancial
Canada or CitiFinancial Servicing at or after the Closing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.07(a), nothing in Section 7.07(a) shall prohibit
Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) from
(i) carrying out their obligations under the Transition Services Agreement,
Reverse Transition Services Agreements or any other Transaction Agreement or
(ii) purchasing or acquiring (through merger, stock purchase or purchase of

promptly as practicable a process to sell all or a portion of such Competitive
CitiFinancial Canada Business to an unaffiliated third party as promptly as
practicable and shall use reasonable best efforts to complete such sale within
six months of such consummation of the purchase or acquisition, such that the
consolidated revenues of the acquired entity attributable to the Competitive
CitiFinancial Canada Business, individually or in the aggregate, do not exceed
ten percent (10%) of the total consolidated revenues of the acquired entity.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 7.07(a) and (b), Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) will not have any liability for
any inadvertent or _de minimis_ violation of this Section 7.07.

 



 

(d) If any provision contained in this Section 7.07 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or

of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein
is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not
permitted by applicable law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater
than those contained herein) as shall be

 



      
 

 



 

valid and enforceable under such Applicable Law. The Company acknowledges that
Seller would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section and that
there would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Seller
for any such breach. Buyer agrees on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) that (i) each of CitiFinancial
Canada and CitiFinancial Servicing shall be an intended third party
beneficiary of this Section 7.07 and entitled to enforce this Section 7.07 as

to the entry thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.08(a), nothing in Section 7.08(a) shall prohibit
Seller and its Subsidiaries from (i) carrying out their obligations under the
Transition Services Agreement, Reverse Transition Services Agreements or any
other Transaction Agreement, (ii) purchasing or acquiring

 



      
 

 



 

(through merger, stock purchase or purchase of all or substantially all of the
assets or otherwise) any entity engaging in the Competitive OneMain Business
at the time of such purchase or acquisition and continuing to engage in such
existing Competitive OneMain Business; _provided_ that if, in the last
completed fiscal quarter prior to the consummation of the purchase or
acquisition, the aggregate consolidated revenue derived from such Competitive
OneMain Business exceeded ten percent (10%) of such acquired entitys total
consolidated revenues over the same period, then Seller shall commence as
promptly as practicable a process to sell all or a portion of such Competitive
OneMain Business to an unaffiliated third party as promptly as practicable and
shall use reasonable best efforts to complete such sale within six months of
such consummation of the purchase or acquisition, such that the consolidated
revenues of the acquired entity attributable to the Competitive OneMain
Business, individually or in the aggregate, do not exceed ten percent (10%) of
the total consolidated revenues of the acquired entity or (iii) without
implying that such activities are restricted by Section 7.08(a), engaging in
or having any direct or indirect ownership interest in any business or line of

course asset management activities of any pension or other benefit plan of
Seller or of its Affiliates. For purposes of the restriction in Section
7.08(a)(i) above, "non-prime customers" will be deemed not to include
potential borrowers with a FICO score of above 630.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 7.08(a) and (b), Seller will not have any
liability for any inadvertent or _de minimis_ violation of this Section 7.08.

 



 

(d) If any provision contained in this Section 7.08 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such

 



      
 

 



 

invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of this Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.
It is the intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or
covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a
length of time which is not permitted by applicable law, or in any way
construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not
be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such
provision would be valid or enforceable under Applicable Law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section to
provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time
period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall
be valid and enforceable under such Applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that
the Company would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section and that
there would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate the
Company for any such breach. Seller agrees on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief requiring
specific performance by Seller and its Subsidiaries of this Section 7.08, and
Seller hereby consents on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries to the entry
thereof.

 



 

Section 7.09. _Modified Closing_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement:

 



 

(a) if at any time:

 



 

(i) the conditions set forth in Article 10, other than (A) conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and (B) the State Regulatory
Approvals Condition, are satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by
the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof;

 



 

(ii) the failure of the State Regulatory Approvals Condition to be satisfied
at such time is solely as a result of the failure of consents, authorizations
or approvals to be received from state regulatory authorities governing
consumer lending in states to which less than ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate amount of Company Loans are attributable (the Company Loans
attributable to such states and the aggregate amount of Company Loans each to
be measured as of the Balance Sheet Date); and

 



 

(iii) Seller determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that it is
possible to structure alternative arrangements (the " **Alternative
Arrangements** ") that would permit the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account the proposed Alternative
Arrangements) without (A) breaching any Applicable Law, (B) materially
affecting the financial benefits to

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer and its Affiliates of the transactions contemplated hereby (it being
understood and agreed that the Alternative Arrangements in and of themselves
would not materially affect such benefits) or (C) materially impeding the
Companys ability to incur or maintain debt financing,

 



 

then, at Sellers option, subject to Article 10 (other than the State
Regulatory Approvals Condition), the State Regulatory Approvals Condition will
be deemed satisfied and the Closing (the " **Modified Closing** ") will occur
as soon as practicable after Seller reasonably determines that such
Alternative Arrangements are in place.

 



 

(b) Seller and the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to structure
and enter into any Alternative Arrangements, which may include (on an interim
basis until the applicable approvals have been obtained) (i) the transfer of
ownership of certain Company Loans or other assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including capital stock or other voting securities of
Subsidiaries of the Company) to Seller or one of its Affiliates (collectively,
the " **Delayed Assets** "); (ii) the entry by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on the other
hand, into interim servicing agreements with respect to Company Loans;
_provided_ that any such interim servicing agreements shall be at cost and
otherwise on commercially reasonable terms and shall terminate upon transfer
of the applicable Delayed Assets to the Company and its Subsidiaries as
contemplated by clause (c) below; and (iii) the suspension of Loan
originations by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Following any Modified Closing, the obligations of the parties under
Section 7.01 shall continue to apply. Upon the receipt of any consents,
authorizations or approvals from state regulatory authorities that are
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the absence of which caused the parties to transfer any Delayed Assets to
Seller or its Affiliates or to enter into any other Alternative Arrangements,
any applicable Delayed Assets shall be transferred to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any applicable Alternative Arrangements shall be terminated.

 



 

(d) Following any Modified Closing, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
any Delayed Assets shall be held by Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, upon the transfer of any Delayed
Assets to the Company and its Subsidiaries, Seller and its Affiliates shall
also transfer to the Company and its Subsidiaries any payments or proceeds
received by Seller or its Affiliates in respect of such Delayed Assets from
and after the Modified Closing.

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any Modified Closing shall constitute the
"Closing" for all purposes of Article 2, and no Alternative Arrangements or
Delayed Assets in connection with any Modified Closing shall

 



       
 

 



 

be taken into account or otherwise reduce the calculation of Stockholders
Equity and the Total Closing Payment for purposes of the payment to be made at
Closing pursuant to Section 2.02(a) or the Total Closing Payment adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.05 and (ii) any representations of Seller that are made
as of the Closing with respect to any Delayed Assets shall instead be deemed
to be made on the date on which such Delayed Assets are transferred to the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Seller will indemnify Buyer and the Company against any fines, penalties
or similar amounts assessed by Governmental Authorities to the extent arising
from any Modified Closing or Alternative Arrangements with respect to any
Delayed Assets.

 



 

Section 7.10. _Customer Data_. (a) Buyer, Seller and the Company acknowledge
and agree that (i) as Affiliates of Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries
currently have access to certain data concerning CFS Customers (" **Customer
Data** ") housed on shared servers of Seller and its Affiliates, which
Customer Data includes personally identifiable information and
creditworthiness information with respect to CFS Customers, and (ii) as of the
Closing, the Companys and its Subsidiaries access to the Customer Data
housed on shared servers of Seller will be terminated (other than any such
access as may be permitted by Seller and its Affiliates in connection with the
services provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to Seller and its
Affiliates pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the
Transition Services Agreement). Buyer, Seller and the Company further
acknowledge and agree that, prior to the Closing, the Company may make a copy
of certain Customer Data as it exists at such time.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Company agrees that it will not, and it
will cause its Affiliates not to, provide, license or otherwise transfer any
Customer Data to any Persons, other than (i) as permitted under 16 CFR
§313.15(2), (4), (5) and (7) and (ii) to Subsidiaries of the Company, in each
case where the transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of Section
7.10(c).

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, the Company agrees that it and any other
Persons that receive any Customer Data in accordance with Section 7.10(b) will
use such Customer Data only for credit risk management or modeling activities
or analyses.

Servicing with active accounts, (ii) personal loan customers of CitiFinancial
Servicing with paid-off or charged-off accounts, (iii) personal loan customers
of CitiFinancial Servicing with accounts that have been transferred to third
parties, including pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as of
July 18, 2013, between CitiFinancial Credit Company and CVI Loan Trust I,

 



      
 

 



 

and (iv) personal loan applicants of CitiFinancial Servicing whose
applications were declined, rejected or withdrawn.

 



 

Section 7.11. _Separation Matters_. (a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate to develop the Migration Plans (as defined in, and for
purposes of, the Transition Services Agreement and the Reverse Transition
Services Agreements). Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall
consider in good faith any changes to the Business (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) proposed to be made by Buyer after the Closing,
including with respect to the matters set forth on Section 7.11 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) Upon Sellers request, Buyer will reimburse Seller in accordance with the
terms of Section 4 of the Transition Services Agreement, for the costs of
separating Sellers centralized corporate systems related to the provision of
general ledger and "procure 2 pay" transition services so that the Company can
perform such functions on a standalone basis.

 



 

(c) Commencing promptly after the date hereof, the parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate to evaluate (including relevant ability to transfer) the
specific unit licenses to software used by the Company and its Subsidiaries
(excluding any unit licenses used beneficially by both the Company or its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or its Affiliates, on the other
hand, the " **Company Unit Licenses** ") under contracts to which Seller or
its Affiliates are the contract party, including those set forth in Section
3.04(iii)(4) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (" **Seller Enterprise
Contracts** "), with the intent of transferring or replacing the Company Unit
Licenses (but in no event, for the avoidance of doubt, any of the Seller
Enterprise Contracts themselves) in a cost-effective manner effective as of
the Closing; _provided_ that, Seller and its Affiliates will not be obligated
to modify or violate any Seller Enterprise Contract terms and conditions
applicable to Seller or its Affiliates, or to pay any fees or other costs
charged by vendors for purchase, transfer or replacement of any Company Unit
Licenses. Upon the request of Buyer but subject to the proviso in the
foregoing sentence, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to (i)
assign to the Company or its Subsidiaries the Company Unit Licenses that are
assignable under the Seller Enterprise Contracts by their terms and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to assign to the Company or the Subsidiaries
other Company Unit Licenses identified by Buyer.

 



 

(d) Without limiting Section 7.11(c), Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at Buyers expense, to obtain
replacement contract rights (or replacement software or capabilities) for the
Company Unit Licenses for the period from and after, and contingent upon, the
Closing, as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing, Seller will, without limiting the Transition
Services Agreement services, license to the Company on commercially reasonable
terms (including on a royalty-free, fully paid-up basis, which license shall
also include use by Affiliates of the Company), rights to the source code for
Action.

 



 

Section 7.12. _Obligations of the Company_. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall take all action necessary to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement that are to be
performed prior to the Closing. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall take
all action necessary to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement that are to be performed
from and after the Closing.

TAX MATTERS

 



 

Section 8.01. _Tax Covenants_ _._ (a) Except as required by a Final
Determination, as contemplated by this Agreement (including the making of a
Section 336(e) Election and a Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), or with the consent of the
Seller, Buyer covenants that it will not cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of Buyer (i) to take any action on the
Closing Date outside the ordinary course of business that could give rise to
any Tax liability, or reduce any Tax Asset, of Seller or any of its Affiliates
or give rise to any Tax Loss of Seller or any of its Affiliates under this
Agreement or (ii) to make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or
take any Tax position on any Tax Return that results in any increased Tax
liability or reduction of any Tax Asset of Seller or any of its Affiliates in
respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) Buyer, Seller, and the Company agree (and shall cause their Affiliates) to
make a timely election under Section 336(e) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder and under any comparable statutes in any other jurisdiction with
respect to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that is treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, excluding any Subsidiary
that converted to a disregarded entity in a Liquidation pursuant to Section
8.02(e) (each such Subsidiary for which such election is made, an "
**Applicable Subsidiary** ," and each such election, a " **Section 336(e)
Election**"), and to file each such election in accordance with applicable
regulations. Without limiting the foregoing: (A) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, but in any event prior to
the due date for the Citi Group

 



      
 

 



 

consolidated federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the
Closing Date, Buyer, Seller, the Company and each Applicable Subsidiary shall
enter into a written, binding agreement to make the Section 336(e) Elections
as described in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.336-2(h)(1)(i) and
1.336-2(h)(4) (the " **336(e) Agreement**"), (B) Seller shall cause Citigroup
Inc. to retain a copy of the 336(e) Agreement, in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.336-2(h)(2)(ii); (C) Seller shall cause Citigroup Inc. to
timely file with its U.S. federal consolidated Tax Return for the taxable year
that includes the Closing Date an election statement for each Section 336(e)
Election satisfying the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.336-2(h)(2)(i), (h)(5) and (h)(6) (each, an " **Election Statement** "), a
draft of which Citigroup Inc. shall provide to Buyer for its review and
comment at least 30 days prior to such due date, (D) prior to the due date for
the Citi Group U.S. consolidated federal income Tax Return for the taxable
year that includes the Closing Date, Seller shall cause Citigroup Inc. to
provide the Company and each Applicable Subsidiary with its respective
Election Statement, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.336-2(h)(2), and (E) Buyer and Seller shall timely file or cause to be
timely filed a IRS Form 8883 (or successor or comparable form with respect to
elections under Section 336(e)) with respect to the Company and each Acquired
Subsidiary that is consistent with the Price Allocation (as defined below). As
promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten Business Days) following
the due date of the Citi Group consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return for
the taxable year that includes the Closing Date, Seller shall provide (or
cause to be provided) to Buyer written confirmation or other evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that the Election Statements have been
attached to such Tax Return, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.336-2(h)(1)(iii). The Section 336(e) Elections shall properly reflect the
Price Allocation (as hereinafter defined). Within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the " **Allocation
Statement** ") allocating the ADADP and AGUB (as such terms are defined in
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.336-3 and 1.336-4) of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the Treasury regulations
promulgated under Section 336(e). Seller shall have the right to review the
Allocation Statement. If within 45 days after receipt of the Allocation
Statement Seller notifies Buyer in writing that it disagrees with one or more
items on the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller will negotiate in good
faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Seller fail to resolve such
dispute within 30 days, an accounting firm of national standing mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the " **Tax Referee** ") shall determine the
appropriate allocation and revise the Allocation Statement accordingly. If
Seller does not respond within 45 days of its initial receipt of the
Allocation Statement, or upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocation
reflected on the Allocation Statement (as

 



      
 

 



 

such may have been adjusted) shall be the " **Price Allocation** " and shall
be binding on the parties hereto. Seller and Buyer agree to act in accordance
with the Price Allocation in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax
Return. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall
constitute an express or implied representation, warranty or guarantee by
Buyer or Seller as to the qualification of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as a "qualified stock disposition" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.336-1(b)(6)) for which a valid Section 336(e) Election
may be made.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.01, upon the
reasonable request of either Buyer or Seller on or before the date that is 30
days prior to the due date for filing an IRS Form 8023 with respect to the
purchase of Company Shares contemplated by this Agreement (assuming such
purchase were to qualify for an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(a " **Section 338(h)(10) Election**")), Buyer and Seller shall (in addition
to, and not in lieu of, the Section 336(e) Elections) make (and cause their
Affiliates to cooperate in making) a timely Section 338(h)(10) Election with
respect to the Company and each Applicable Subsidiary, and the filings
described in Section 8.01(b)(i) and any other filings that may be required in
order to make such elections shall be made, to the extent applicable, on a
"protective" basis, with the provisions of Section 8.01(b)(i) applying
_mutatis mutandis_. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
8.01(b)(ii) shall constitute an express or implied representation, warranty or
guarantee by Buyer or Seller as to the qualification of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as a "qualified stock purchase" (as defined in
Section 338(d)(3)) for which a valid Section 338(h)(10) Election may be made.

 



 

(iii) Except as specifically set forth in Section 8.06(a)(i) (insofar as it
relates to the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.19(c)),
Section 8.06(a)(ii) (insofar as it relates to breaches of the covenants
contained in Section 8.01(b)(i) (after giving effect to the last sentence
thereof), Section 8.01(b)(ii) (after giving effect to the last sentence
thereof) and Section 8.02) and Section 8.06(b) (insofar as it relates to the
representation and warranty contained in Section 4.06 and the covenants
contained in Section 8.01(b)(i) (after giving effect to the last sentence
thereof), Section 8.01(b)(ii) (after giving effect to the last sentence
thereof) and Section 8.02), neither Buyer nor Seller shall be liable to the
other, or any of their Affiliates (including in the case of the Buyer, from
and after the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) in the event
that it is subsequently determined by a Taxing Authority that a Section 336(e)
Election or a Section 338(h)(10) Election is not eligible to be made with
respect to the transactions occurring pursuant to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (other than any Tax Returns with respect to Tax periods
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending thereafter (" **Straddle
Period Returns** ")) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries that are
required to be filed by Applicable Law. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries have adopted a past
practice with respect to the Tax matter in question.

 



 

(d) (i) Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) any
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries not prepared by Seller under
Section 8.01(c).

 



 

(ii) No less than 45 days prior to the due date (taking into account any
extensions) for a Straddle Period Return, Buyer shall provide Seller with a
draft copy of such Straddle Period Return along with a statement describing in
reasonable detail any liability of Seller pursuant to Section 8.06 or
otherwise (the " **Straddle Period Indemnification Statement** "). Seller
shall, within 15 days after the receipt of such Straddle Period Return and
Straddle Period Indemnification Statement, notify Buyer whether it disputes or
otherwise disagrees with any item reported on such Straddle Period Return or
Straddle Period Indemnification Statement and provide Buyer with its
calculation of the disputed item (the " **Dispute Notice** "). Buyer shall, no
more than 15 days after receipt of the Dispute Notice, notify Seller whether
it accepts the calculation set forth in the Dispute Notice. If Buyer does not
accept the calculation of the item set forth on the Dispute Notice, then the
Tax Referee shall make a determination as to the disputed items, which
determination shall be binding on the parties hereto. As promptly as possible
following such determination (but in any event before the due date (taking
into account any extensions) for such Tax Return), Seller shall pay to Buyer
the amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable under such determination. The
cost of such accounting firms review and determination shall be shared
equally by the parties.

 



 

Section 8.02. _5% Ownership Events_. (a) Seller and Buyer shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts not
to take any action prior to the Closing that could reasonably be expected to
result in the representation contained in Section 3.19(c) being untrue, as if
such representation were delivered at and as of the Closing but taking into
account constructive ownership by Citigroup Inc. and its Majority Entities
within the meaning of Section 318 of the Code, as modified by Treasury
Regulation Section 1.336-1(b)(12) (a " **5% Ownership Event** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.02(a), (i) Seller shall
complete the procedures set forth on Section 1.01(a)-4 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule on the Procedure Retest Date and the Closing Date prior to
Closing, (ii) Buyer shall provide notice to Seller from time to time but no
later than the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date of any
amendments to Section 4.06 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule occurring prior to
such date, (iii) in the event that either party becomes aware of the
occurrence of a 5% Ownership Event or any circumstance that could reasonably
be expected to result in a 5% Ownership Event, Seller or Buyer, as the case
may be, shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to remedy or avoid
such 5% Ownership Event, including, in the case of Seller, by using
commercially reasonable efforts to dispose (or to cause the disposition) of
the requisite number of interests in FIG or any Fortress Fund, such that,
after giving effect to such disposition, the 5% Ownership Event ceases to
exist.

 



 

(c) The covenants described in Sections 8.02(a) and 8.02(b) to use
commercially reasonable efforts to remedy, avoid or cure a 5% Ownership Event,
in the case of Seller, shall apply only to equity interests in FIG and the
Fortress Funds (other than Excluded Fortress Funds) actually owned by
Citigroup Inc. or any Majority Entity and shall apply as if each Fortress
Feeder Fund were a Fortress Fund.

 



 

(d) Each of Seller and Buyer shall notify the other party as soon as
reasonably practicable in the event that Seller or Buyer becomes aware of (x)
the occurrence of (A) a 5% Ownership Event or (B) any event or set of facts
that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to otherwise
fail to qualify as a "qualified stock disposition" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.336-1(b)(6)) by reason of Seller and Buyer being
"related" persons (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.336-1(b)(5) and (12)) (a " **Related Person Event** ") or (y) any
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in a 5% Ownership
Event or a Related Person Event. In addition, in the event that any covenant
in Section 8.02(a) or 8.02(b) does not apply, Buyer and Seller shall
nevertheless seek to cooperate in good faith to remedy or avoid the related 5%
Ownership Event or Related Person Event.

 



 

(e) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and
each Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Excluded Subsidiaries) that is,
as of the date of this Agreement, treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes to become a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (for example, either by converting from a corporation to a limited
liability company under applicable state law or by filing a valid election to
be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) prior
to the Closing Date (each, a " **Liquidation** " and collectively, the "
**Liquidations** "). Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Seller in effecting the

 



      
 

 



 

Liquidations. Buyer and Seller intend, for U.S. federal (and corresponding
state and local) income tax purposes, that any Liquidation effected prior to
Closing be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a liquidation of
the Company and applicable Company Subsidiaries occurring prior to the
purchase of the equity of the Company by Buyer on the Closing Date, and that
such purchase be treated as a purchase of all of the assets of the Company and
any Company Subsidiary that participates in the Liquidations, and Buyer and
Seller shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, take any position
on any Tax Return inconsistent with such intent. For the avoidance of doubt,
in the event that the Liquidations are effected for one or more entities under
this Section 8.02(e), the parties shall not make Section 336(e) Elections or
Section 338(h)(10) Elections with respect to such entities but shall make such
elections for any other entities for which such elections are required to be
made by Section 8.01(b).

 



 

Section 8.03. _Refunds_. (a) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to
Seller all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) attributable
to Taxes paid by Seller, its Affiliates or the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall promptly pay or cause
to be paid to Buyer all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller attributable to Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Section 8.03, Tax refunds shall include any interest
that is paid as part of the payment of such refunds, reduced by the increase
in the original payees federal, state, local, foreign, or other Taxes payable
attributable to such interest after taking into account any offsetting
deductions or credits.

 



 

Section 8.04. _Transfer Taxes_ _. _All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any New York or other real property transfer Tax and any
similar Tax) shall be borne and paid by Buyer. Seller shall file or cause to
be filed all necessary Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Taxes and fees, and, if required by Applicable Law, Buyer will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

 



 

Section 8.05. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_ _. _Buyer and Seller shall furnish
or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably
necessary for the making of the Section 336(e) Elections and Section
338(h)(10) Elections and the filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation of
financial statements, for

 



      
 

 



 

the review of any Straddle Period Indemnification Statement or any other claim
for indemnification related to Taxes, for the preparation for any audit, and
for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to
any proposed adjustment. Buyer and Seller, and their affiliates, shall retain
or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries until the expiration of the applicable period for assessment
under Applicable Law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) and
shall abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to give Seller or Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give Buyer, as applicable, reasonable notice prior to transferring,
discarding or destroying any such books and records relating to Tax matters of
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and, if the other party
so requests, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall allow the other party to
take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Tax purposes and each shall execute
and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to
carry out the intent of this subsection. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its affiliates shall be entitled
to any information relating to, or a copy of, any consolidated, combined,
affiliated or unitary Tax Return which includes Sellers (other than _pro
forma_ information relating only to the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 



 

Section 8.06. _Tax Indemnification_ _. _(a) Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer
and its Affiliates against and agrees to hold them harmless from any Taxes and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding (and, with respect solely to breaches of the representations
contained in Section 3.15(d), toll charges and other reasonable costs and
expenses incurred with respect to the remediation of any Insurance Contract)
arising out of, incident to, or as a result of: (i) without duplication of any
of clauses (ii) through (v), the breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.19 or Section 3.15(d)
(without giving effect to any limitation or qualification as to "materiality"
set forth in any such representation or warranty); (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of the Seller contained in Section 5.01(k) or this
Article 8; (iii) Taxes of or attributable to the Company or any Subsidiary for
any Pre-Closing Tax Periods; (iv) Taxes imposed on the Company or any
Subsidiary under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (and any corresponding
provisions of state, local or foreign Law) as a result of being a member of
any consolidated, unitary, combined or similar group for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; and (v) any amount required to be paid by the Company or any
Subsidiary under a Tax Sharing Agreement (other than this Agreement) or on a
transferee or successor liability theory, in respect of any Taxes of any
Person, if such agreement or application of transferee or successor liability
theory was entered into, or relates to any transaction occurring, on or prior
to the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date (collectively, a " **Tax Loss** "); _provided_ that Seller shall have no
liability for the payment of any Tax Loss to the extent that there is included
in the Closing Balance Sheet a specific liability or reserve relating to such
Tax Loss or the Buyer or its Affiliate had otherwise been compensated for such
Tax Loss pursuant to the Total Closing Payment adjustment under Section 2.05;
and _provided, further,_ that, with respect solely to indemnification by
Seller for breach of Section 3.19(c) or Section 8.02, Sellers maximum
liability for all such breaches shall not exceed: (i) if all Liquidations
occur prior to Closing, $70,000,000; or (ii) otherwise, $90,000,000.

 



 

(b) Buyer and, effective at and after the Closing, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any Taxes and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding actually suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates arising out of
(i) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer or,
after the Closing, the Company pursuant to this Article 8 or (ii) any breach
or inaccuracy of the representation and warranty contained in Section 4.06;
provided, further, that, with respect solely to indemnification by Buyer for
breach of Section 4.06 or Section 8.02, Buyers maximum liability for all such
breaches shall not exceed: (i) if all Liquidations occur prior to Closing,
$70,000,000; or (ii) otherwise, $90,000,000.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Article 8, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed
with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based
upon or related to income or any gross receipts, sales or use Taxes, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending
on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Tax period and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and
included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (ii) shall be made in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the Company or its relevant Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) If any claim or demand for Taxes that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to a Tax Loss for which Seller would liable under this Agreement is
asserted by any Taxing Authority, Buyer or the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall notify Seller of such claim or demand promptly but not later than the
time that would allow Seller to timely respond to such claim or demand, and
shall give Seller such information with respect thereto as Seller may
reasonably request. Seller may, at its own expense, participate in and, upon
notice to Buyer or the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, assume the
defense of any such claim, suit, action, litigation or proceeding (including
any

 



       
 

 



 

Tax audit) (each, a " **Tax Contest** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that as a
condition to the Sellers exercise of its right to assume the defense of any
such Tax Contest, the Seller shall acknowledge in writing that it will be
liable for any Taxes or other Damages resulting from the resolution of such
Tax Contest. If Seller assumes such defense, Seller shall have the sole
discretion as to the conduct of such defense (including the right to settle
such claim, suit, action, litigation or proceeding except that, if such
settlement will have an adverse effect that is material on Buyer or the
Company and its Subsidiaries, Seller shall only settle such matter with
Buyers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Whether or not Seller chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all
of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
The failure of Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary to comply with the
provisions of this Section 8.06(d) shall not relieve Seller of its
indemnification obligations pursuant to this Article 8, except to the extent
that Seller is prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(e) Any dispute as to any matter covered in this Section 8.06 shall be
resolved by the Tax Referee. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. If any dispute with respect to a
Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return,
such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which the party responsible for
preparing such Tax Return deems correct.

 



 

Section 8.07. _Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Citigroup Tax Sharing Agreement,
dated as of January 1, 2013, to which the Company and its Subsidiaries are
parties (the " **Citigroup Tax Sharing Agreement** "), shall be terminated
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and
shall have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a
future year, or a past year), and no additional payments shall be made
thereunder on or after the Closing Date in respect of a redetermination of Tax
liabilities or otherwise.

 



 

Section 8.08. _Purchase Price Adjustment_ _. _Any amount paid by a Seller or
Buyer under Section 2.05, this Article 8 or Article 11 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by any Taxing
Authority or Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.09. _Survival of Obligations_ _._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, including Article 11, (i) the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.19 and 3.15(d) shall survive the Closing
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; (ii) the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.06 shall survive the

 **ARTICLE 9**

 



 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 



 

Section 9.01. _Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits; Severance; Bonus_ _._
(a) For the duration of the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending,
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) below, on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, or in the case of clause (iii) below, on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, or such longer period as may be required by Applicable
Law, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide
to each Company Employee (i) a base wage rate or salary that in each case is
at least as favorable as that provided to each such employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date, (ii) variable incentive compensation opportunities and
annual bonus opportunities that in each case are materially consistent with
those provided to similarly situated and similarly performing employees of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries and (iii) employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements (other than defined benefit pension or post-
retirement health plans, programs, policies or arrangements) that, combined
with any cash paid in lieu of benefits, in the aggregate are no less favorable
than those provided to each such employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date. In addition, unless agreed upon by such Company Employee, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries not to, during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, increase the commute, as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date, of any Company Employee by 30 or more miles one way.

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall cause each Company Employee to
cease participating in any Seller Plan other than a Company Plan, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cease to be participating employers
in any Seller Plan other than a Company Plan. Seller shall retain all
liabilities under any Seller Plan other than a Company Plan (including any
Seller Plan that is a defined benefit pension or post-retirement health plan),
other than any such liabilities to the extent that (x) there is included in
the Closing Balance Sheet a specific liability or reserve relating to such
liability or (y) Buyer has otherwise been compensated for such liability
pursuant to the Total Closing Payment adjustment under Section 2.05.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide
to any Company Employee whose employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is terminated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date under circumstances that would have triggered severance
benefits under the relevant Seller Plan had such termination occurred
immediately prior to the Closing Date severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided under such applicable Seller
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date to similarly situated employees
(subject to the terms of any such Seller Plans, including any requirement to
execute a release of claims in favor of Buyer and its Affiliates).

 



 

(d) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, be
responsible for all variable compensation or bonus earned by or payable to
each Company Employee in respect of the variable compensation or bonus year in
which the Closing occurs.

 



 

(e) Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause each Company Employee
to become fully vested under each tax-qualified Seller Plan. Following the
Closing, each Company Employee shall continue to vest in their outstanding
awards or accrued benefit under each equity compensation and deferred
compensation plan, as applicable, maintained by Seller, in accordance with the
terms thereof. Such amounts shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such
plans and Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 9.02. _Transfer of Certain Employees_. Seller shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause to be transferred to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries not later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date
substantially all employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates (x) who are
primarily dedicated to providing services to or for the benefit of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y) who have been otherwise agreed to by Buyer
and Seller, in each case who remain employed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates as of such transfer date, and except as would not be material, are
identified on Section 9.02(x) and Section 9.02(y), respectively, of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. Prior to the Closing, Seller may amend Section 9.02(y) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule in good faith as may be necessary to achieve
the intended allocation of employees, subject to Buyers reasonable prior
consultation; _provided_ that if such amendment would cause the aggregate
number of employees listed on Section 9.02(y) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule to exceed 200 full time equivalent employees, such amendment will be
subject to Buyers consent, such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned,
delayed or withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any
employee covered by clause (x) or (y) above is not reasonably able to be
transferred to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall use good faith reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

efforts to provide the services of such individual to the Company pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.03. _Credit for Past Service_ _. _Effective as of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, cause each
Benefit Plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in which any Company Employee on or after the Closing is or
becomes eligible to participate to treat the prior service of each such
employee with any of Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates as service rendered to the Company and its Subsidiaries
or Buyer for all purposes (including vesting, eligibility, level of benefit
(including for purposes of severance and vacation/paid time off benefits) and
benefit accrual purposes, but other than for purposes of benefit accrual under
any defined benefit plan or vesting under any equity compensation plan), to
the extent that such prior service was recognized under the applicable Seller
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent that such service
crediting does not violate any Applicable Law or result in duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

 



 

Section 9.04. _Welfare Plans_ _. _(a) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare
coverage of any Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to
pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment
requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good health under the
applicable health and welfare plan of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer,
including the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent such employee and
his or her eligible dependents are covered under a health and welfare benefit
plan of Sellers or any of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) credit each such employee and his or her eligible dependents with all
deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such employee and
covered dependents under the medical employee benefit plan of Seller or any of
its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing
Date occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
employee and his or her dependents have satisfied their deductible and whether
they have reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any medical plan of Buyer or
any Affiliate of Buyer, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, for such
year.

 



 

(b) Effective from and after the Closing Date, with respect to any claims for
hospital, medical, dental or other health, disability, life insurance or
accidental death or dismemberment benefits, expenses or other reimbursement
provided to or in respect of any Company Employee (or his or her eligible
dependents), (i) Seller shall remain responsible and liable for any such
claims incurred by such Company Employee prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
Buyer or its Affiliates shall assume responsibility for any such claims
incurred by such Company Employee on or after the Closing Date. For purposes
of the foregoing, claims for hospital, medical, dental or other health or
disability benefits

 



      
 

 



 

shall be considered incurred when the services are rendered or supplies are
provided, and not when the condition arose or the applicable claim was
submitted, and claims for life insurance or accidental death or dismemberment
benefits shall be considered incurred on the date of death or dismemberment.

 



 

(c) As applicable, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the last day of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Buyer
shall or shall cause its Affiliates, as the case may be, to (i) maintain
health care, limited purpose healthcare spending and dependent care flexible
spending accounts established under Section 125 of the Code (the " **Buyer
FSA** "), (ii) permit Company Employees to participate in the Buyer FSA to the
extent coverage under such Buyer FSA replaces coverage under a comparable
Seller Plan or other benefit plan of Seller or its Affiliates in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date (the "
**Seller FSA** "), (iii) credit Company Employees under the Buyer FSA
immediately following the Closing Date with amounts available for
reimbursement equal to such amounts as were credited under the Seller FSA with
respect to such person immediately prior to the Closing Date and (iv) give
effect under the Buyer FSA to any elections made by such Company Employees
with respect to the Seller FSA for the year in which the Closing Date occurs.
As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, if the net
difference between (x) the aggregate employee contributions under the Seller
FSA as of the Closing Date made during the year of the Closing Date and (y)
the aggregate employee reimbursements under the Seller FSA as of the Closing
Date made during the year of the Closing Date, in each case with respect to
the Company Employees (the " **Assumed FSA Balance** ") is (1) a positive
number, then Seller shall transfer to Buyer an amount, in cash, equal to the
Assumed FSA Balance or (2) a negative number, then Buyer shall transfer to
Seller an amount, in cash, equal to the positive value of the Assumed FSA
Balance. The parties hereto agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to
implement the provisions of this Section 9.04(c) to take into account the
complexity of transferring flexible spending accounts.

 



 

(d) Effective not later than the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
applicable Affiliates to, maintain a transportation reimbursement plan
comparable to the Citigroup Transportation Reimbursement Incentive Plan (the "
**TRIP** "). The parties shall cooperate in good faith to transfer, as of the
Closing Date, each Company Employees account balance under the TRIP
(including any assets relating thereto), to such comparable employee benefit
plan of Buyer, and Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates, as the case may
be, to honor each unreimbursed claim incurred by each Company Employee on the
same basis as is applicable to claims incurred by participants in the TRIP.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
recognize, honor or otherwise credit all unused vacation/paid time

 



      
 

 



 

off earned by or otherwise accrued in respect of, each Company Employee as of
the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 9.05. _WARN and/or Labour Department Notifications_ _. _In the event
that Buyer determines to terminate, or determines to cause the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to terminate, any Company Employee during the 90-day
period following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller agree to, and Buyer agrees
to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, cooperate and exchange such data
and information as is reasonably necessary to determine whether such
termination would reasonably be expected to result in liability to Buyer or
Seller under WARN, any state displaced worker notification statutes or any
Canadian federal or provincial department of labour reporting requirement.
Buyer agrees to, and to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify
and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all
Damages arising out of or otherwise in respect of any suit or claim of
violation brought against Seller or any of its Affiliates under WARN, any
state displaced worker notification statute and any Canadian provincial or
federal labour reporting legislation for any actions taken by Buyer or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date with respect to any
facility, site or operating unit of the Company Employees.

 



 

Section 9.06. _Workers  Compensation_ _._ Seller shall remain responsible for
any workers compensation claims incurred by a Company Employee prior to the
Closing Date and Buyer shall assume responsibility for any such claims
incurred by a Company Employee on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of
the foregoing, a claim for workers compensation benefits shall be deemed to be
incurred when the event giving rise to the claim occurs.

 



 

Section 9.07. _COBRA_ _. _As applicable, Buyer shall be responsible for
providing continuation coverage under COBRA for any Company Employee (and such
Company Employees qualified beneficiaries) whose qualifying event occurs on
or after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 9.08. _Defined Contribution Plans_ _. _As applicable, in the event
that a Company Employee makes a voluntary election pursuant to Section
401(a)(31) of the Code or applicable law to roll over his or her account
balance in the Citigroup 401(k) Plan or in the Registered Retirement Savings
Plan for Canadian employees to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
sponsored by Buyer or one of its Affiliates, Buyer agrees to cause such tax-
qualified defined contribution plan to accept such rollover.

 



 

Section 9.09. _Third Party Beneficiaries_ _. _(a) As permitted under
Applicable Law, without limiting the generality of Section 13.08, the
provisions of this Article 9 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Company

 



      
 

 



 

Employee or other current or former employee of Seller or any of its
Affiliates or the Company and its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable
or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided
for in this Article 9) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Article 9 shall amend, or be deemed to amend (or prevent
the amendment or termination of) any Benefit Plan or any compensation or
benefit plan of Sellers, the Company and its Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(c) Except to the extent required by Applicable Law, none of Buyer or the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to continue to employ
or retain the services of any Company Employee for any period of time
following the Closing and, except as specifically provided in and subject to
this Article 9, Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled
to modify any compensation or benefits provided to, and any other terms or
conditions of employment of, any such employees in their discretion.

 



 

Section 9.10. _Cooperation_ _. _Each of Buyer, the Company and Seller
recognize it to be in the best interests of the parties hereto and their
respective employees that the transactions in this Article 9 be effected in an
orderly manner and agree to devote their respective best efforts and to
cooperate fully in complying with the provisions of this Article 9. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties agrees to
execute, deliver and file all documents and to take all such actions as are
deemed necessary or desirable in order to carry out and perform the purposes
of this Article 9 and to facilitate the transactions referred to in this
Article 9. In addition, each of Buyer, the Company and Seller agree to
cooperate as necessary to ensure coordination of FICA in respect of the
Company Employees so as to avoid a FICA restart for such employees or, as
applicable, to avoid any tax restart for employees in Canada.

indemnity is sought (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") of the assertion of any
claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party
(" **Third Party Claim** ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
such Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third
Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have adversely
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 11.03(b), shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for
such defense, in each case at its own expense.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.03, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering
into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not
expressly release the Indemnified Party and its affiliates from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or the
settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates and (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and
to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 11.04. _Direct Claim Procedures_ _. _In the event an Indemnified Party
has a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 or Section 7.02(c) against an
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party.

 



      
 

 



 

Following receipt of such notice, the parties shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 13.06.

 



 

Section 11.05. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 11.02, 7.02(c) or 7.09(f) by the Indemnifying Party shall be net
of any (i) amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor
(net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount), and (ii) Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified
Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. If the
Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or
from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party,
net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02, Section
7.02(c) or 7.09(f) for any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent
that (A) there is included in the Closing Balance Sheet a specific liability
or reserve relating to such Damages or (B) the Indemnified Party had otherwise
been compensated for such matter pursuant to the Total Closing Payment
adjustment under Section 2.05; (ii) consequential or punitive Damages, unless
awarded to a third party, or (iii) Damages for lost profits; _provided_ that
the limitations in the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) shall not apply to
consequential Damages and Damages for lost profits to the extent arising from
a breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that gives rise to
reasonably foreseeable lost revenue or profit from the inability to operate
existing Company branches as they operate immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided, further_ , that Sellers maximum liability for any such
consequential Damages and Damages for lost profits, together with Sellers
liability for all Seller Breaches pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i), shall not
exceed the single cap of $250,000,000.

 



 

(c) Each Indemnified Party must use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any loss for which such Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party
mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party
under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss,
the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified
Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys reasonable costs of
mitigation) within two Business Days after the benefit is received.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

 



 

Section 11.06. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party (a " **Potential Contributor** ") based on the
underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

 



 

Section 11.07. _Exclusivity_. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement (including Article 8) or any other Transaction Agreement, Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries), waives any rights and claims that any of the foregoing
may have against Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives whether in law or in equity, relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Shares or the transactions contemplated by any
Transaction Agreement. The rights and claims waived by Buyer include claims
for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any
Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of
contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation
and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, Sections 7.02(c),
7.09(f), 11.02 and 13.12 will provide the exclusive remedy for any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement (other than
those contained in Section 2.05 and Article 8) or other claim arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 12**

 



 

TERMINATION

 



 

Section 12.01. _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 



 

(b) subject to Section 7.01(e), by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall
not have been consummated on or before March 2, 2016; _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) shall not
be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
results in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if on such date any of the conditions set forth
in Section 10.01(a) or Section 10.01(c) have not been satisfied, such date may
be extended

 



      
 

 



 

by Seller or Buyer, by written notice to the other, to a date not beyond June
2, 2016; or

 



 

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any
Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(b) or
Section 12.01(c) shall give notice of such termination to the other party.

 



 

Section 12.02. _Effect of Termination_. (a) If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of
either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party) to the other parties to this
Agreement; _provided_ that if such termination shall result from the willful
failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement, such party shall be fully
liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other parties as a
result of such failure or breach. The provisions of Sections 7.02(c), 13.01,
13.03, 13.05, 13.06 and 13.07 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to
Section 12.01.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Seller pursuant
to (i) Section 12.01(c) with respect to Regulatory Laws or (ii) Section
12.01(b) and, in the case of this clause (ii), as of the Termination Date, (A)
one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 10.01(a) or Section
10.01(b) has not been satisfied (including as a result of Buyer not agreeing
to take or not taking any Antitrust Action in excess of the Detriment Limit,
but only, in the case of 10.01(b), if the failure to meet such condition is a
result of any Regulatory Law) and (B) all of the other conditions set forth in
Section 10.01 and Section 10.02 have been satisfied or deemed satisfied
pursuant to Section 7.09 (other than any such conditions which by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date but subject to such conditions
being capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of
termination); _provided_ that for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Sections 10.02(a)(ii) and 10.02(a)(iii) have been
satisfied the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" shall be interpreted
without taking into account any effect resulting from any Regulatory Law
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or prohibition under or in
respect of any Regulatory Law applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby;

 



 

then, in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 12.02(b),
Buyer shall pay to Seller a termination fee of $212,500,000 in cash (the "
**Termination Fee** "), it being understood that in no event shall Buyer be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 12.02(b) shall be made
to Seller promptly following termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.01(b) or Section 12.01(c) (and in any event not later than three (3)
Business Days after delivery to Buyer of notice of demand for payment) and
shall be made to Seller concurrently with, and as a condition to the
effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to
Section 12.01(b) or Section 12.01(c); and, in each case, such payment shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account details of
Seller provided in writing by Seller to Buyer for such purposes.

 



 

(d) In the event that Buyer shall fail to pay the Termination Fee required
pursuant to this Section 12.02 when due, such fee shall accrue interest for
the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a rate per
annum equal to the prime rate as published in the _Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition_ in effect from time to time during such period. In addition,
if Buyer shall fail to pay such fee when due, Buyer shall also pay to Seller
all of Sellers costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection
with efforts to collect such fee.

 



 

(e) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Termination Fee and the other
provisions of this Section 12.02 are an integral part of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements,
Seller would not enter into this Agreement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that
the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable amount that will
compensate Seller for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in circumstances where Buyer has not committed a willful
and material breach of Section 7.01 and payment of the Termination Fee is
required hereunder, upon such payment, the payment of the Termination Fee in
accordance with this Section 12.02, shall be the exclusive remedy of Seller
for (i) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated and (ii) any other losses, damages,
obligations or liabilities suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as otherwise provided in the
previous sentence, upon payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 12.02, none of Buyer or any of its stockholders, partners, members,
directors, Affiliates, officers or agents, as the case may be, shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the

Seller Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and information solely

irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof,
