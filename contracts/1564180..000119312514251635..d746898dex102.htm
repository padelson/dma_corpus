provided, that if this Agreement is terminated by a Party because of the
breach of this Agreement by the other Party or because one or more of the

satisfied as a result of the other Partys failure to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement, the terminating Partys right to pursue all
legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.

Subject to Clause 13, following the Closing, the Seller shall be liable

   a) | by reason of, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any

Agreement or in or under any document, instrument or agreement delivered

   12.3 | Indemnification procedures with respect to third-party claims 
---|--- 

If the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be (an "Indemnified Party"),
shall receive notice of any claim by a third party that is or may be subject
to indemnification or compensation from the other Party pursuant to this
Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give the other
Party (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt written notice of such Third-Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys option,
have the right to participate in the defence thereof by counsel at the
Indemnifying Partys own cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges within 30 days from such written notice in writing its obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party against all Losses that may result from
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at the
Indemnifying Partys option, to assume and control the defence of such Third-
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys cost and expense and through counsel

   18 | GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION 
---|--- 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance

__The Parties shall seek to solve through negotiations any dispute,
controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
breach, termination or invalidity hereof. If the Parties fail to solve such
dispute, controversy or claim by a written agreement within 60 days after one
of the Parties has requested such negotiations by notice to the other
Party, such dispute, controversy or claim shall be finally settled by
arbitration in Haugesund in the English language in accordance with the
Norwegian Arbitration Act. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three
arbitrators, of which the Buyer shall appoint one arbitrator and the Seller
shall appoint one arbitrator. The arbitrators so appointed shall appoint the
third arbitrator, who shall be the chairman of the arbitration tribunal. In
the event of failure by a Party to appoint its arbitrator within 30 days
after the request for arbitration first is given, or the failure by the first
two arbitrators to appoint the third arbitrator within 30 days after
appointment of the last of the first two arbitrators to be appointed, such
arbitrator or arbitrators shall be appointed by the district judge (No: "
_Sorenskriver_ ") of Haugesund District Court. Any Party may seek judgement
upon any award in any court having jurisdiction, or an application may be made
to such court for the judicial acceptance of the award and for an order of
enforcement. __

Notwithstanding the above, either Party may bring an action in any court
of competent jurisdiction (a) for provisional relief pending the outcome of
arbitration, including, without limitation, provisional injunctive relief or
pre-judgement attachment of assets, or (b) to compel arbitration or enforce
any arbitral award. For purposes of any proceeding authorised by this Clause
17, each Party hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of Haugesund,
Norway.

14 AS and Knutsen Shuttle Tankers 15 AS, which comprise the combined balance
sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related combined statements
of operations, combined statements of owners equity and combined statements
of cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the combined
financial statements.

 

Managements Responsibility for the Combined Financial Statements

 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
combined financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design,
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of combined financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors Responsibility

 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the combined financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the combined financial statements are free of material
misstatement.

 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the combined financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the combined financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments,
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation
and fair presentation of the combined financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys
internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the combined financial
statements.

Opinion

 

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Knutsen Shuttle
Tanker 14 AS and Knutsen Shuttle Tanker 15 AS as of December 31, 2013 and
2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then
ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

6 1) Description of Business

 

Knutsen Shuttle Tankers 14 AS and Knutsen Shuttle Tankers 15 AS (hereafter
referred as the "Companies") own the 123,000 DWT Suez-max shuttle tanker,
_Hilda Knutsen_ , and the 123,000 DWT Suez-max shuttle tanker, _Torill
Knutsen_ , respectively, delivered from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI)
Shipyard in South Korea on August 5, 2013 and November 4, 2013.

 

Knutsen Shuttle Tankers 14 AS was established on March 25, 2011 to take
ownership of one building contract for one 123,000 DWT Suez-max shuttle
tanker, _Hilda Knutsen,_ delivered on August 5, 2013. Knutsen Shuttle Tankers
15 AS was established on June 1, 2011 to take ownership of one building
contract for one 123,000 DWT Suez-max shuttle tanker, _Torill Knutsen, _
delivered on November 4, 2013. Both the _Hilda Knutsen_ and the _Torill
Knutsen_ (the "Vessels") are on time-charter contracts to Eni Trading and
Shipping S.p.A. ("Eni"), for operation primarily on the Goliat offshore oil
field outside northern Norway on a five-year time-charter agreement with five
one-year-options. In the case of the charter for the _Torill Knutsen_ , Eni
has the option, at any time before May 31, 2016, to extend the charter term
to ten years in exchange for a reduction in the hire rate.

The Companies are owned by Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers AS ("KNOT"), and are
operating as an integrated part of KNOT. KNOT is owned 50% by TS Shipping
Invest AS ("TSSI") and 50% by Nippon Yusen Kaisha ("NYK"). Technical and
commercial management of the vessels have been subcontracted to Knutsen OAS
Shipping AS ("KOAS") up to July 1, 2012 and thereafter by KNOT Management AS,
a 100% owned subsidiary of KNOT. KOAS is controlled 99% by TSSI.

 

There are no employees in the Companies and daily operation is managed by KNOT
Management AS.

 

2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

_(a) Basis of Preparation_

The combined financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP").

_(b) Reporting Currency_

 

The combined financial statements are prepared in the reporting currency of
U.S. Dollars. The functional currency of the Companies is the U.S. Dollar,
because both entities operate in the international shipping market all
revenues are U.S. Dollars denominated and the majority of the expenditures are
made in U.S. Dollars. Transactions involving other currencies during the year
are converted into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the
time of the transactions. As of the balance sheet dates, monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are
translated to reflect the year-end exchange rates. Resulting gains and losses
are reflected separately in the accompanying combined statements of
operations.

_(c) Use of Estimates_

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates
and assumptions include the useful lives and impairment of Vessels,
drydocking, and income taxes.

 

 _(d) Revenues and Operating Expenses_

 

The Companies recognize revenues from time charters as operating leases on a
straight-line basis over the term of the charter, net of any commissions.
Under time charters, revenue is not recognized during days the Vessel is off-
hire. Revenue is recognized from delivery of the Vessel to the charterer,
until the end of the contract period. Under time charters, the Companies
are responsible for providing the crewing and other services related to the
Vessels operations, the cost of which is included in the daily hire rate,
except when off-hire. Fees received from customers for customized equipment
are deferred and recognized over the contract period. The Companies recognize
revenues from spot contracts as voyage revenues using the percentage of
completion method on a discharge-to-discharge basis.

 

Voyage expenses are all expenses unique to a particular voyage, including
bunker fuel expenses, port fees, cargo loading and unloading expenses, canal
tolls and agency fees. Voyage expenses are paid by the customer under time
charters.

Vessel operating expenses include crewing, repairs and maintenance,
insurance, stores, lube oils and communication expenses. Vessel operating
expenses are paid by the Companies for time charters and during off-hire and
are recognized when incurred.

 

As further discussed in Note 13Related Party Transactions, related parties
have provided the management services for the Vessels and employ the crews
that work on the Vessels. The Companies have no direct employees and,
accordingly, are not liable for any pension or post-retirement benefits.

 

 _(e) Financial Income (Expense)_

 

Interest expenses incurred on the Companies debt incurred during the
construction of the Vessels exceeding one year are capitalized during the
construction period.

 



7 _(f) Cash and Cash Equivalents_

 

The Companies consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

_(g) Trade Accounts Receivable_

 

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
interest. Under terms of the current time charters, the customers
are committed to pay for the full months charter the first day of each
month. See Note 2(o) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Prepaid
Charter and Deferred Revenue. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
Companies best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing
accounts receivable. The Companies establish provisions for doubtful accounts
on a case-by-case basis when it is unlikely that required payments of specific
amounts will occur. In establishing these provisions, the Companies consider
the financial condition of the customer as well as specific circumstances
related to the receivable. Receivable amounts determined to be unrecoverable
are written-off. There were no provisions as allowance for doubtful accounts
or amounts written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012. The Companies do not have any off-balance-sheet
credit exposure related to their customers.

 

 _(h) Inventories_

Inventories, which are comprised principally of lubricating oils, are stated
at the lower of cost or market. For vessels on time charters, there are no
bunkers, as the charterer supplies the bunkers, which principally consist of
fuel oil. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method for all
inventories.

_(i) Other Current Assets_

 

Other current assets principally consist of prepaid expenses, the current
portion of deferred cost and other receivables.

 

 _(j) Vessels and Equipment_

Vessels and equipment are stated at the historical acquisition or
construction cost, including capitalized interest, supervision and technical
and delivery cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if
any. Expenditures for subsequent conversions and major improvements are
capitalized, provided that such costs increase the earnings capacity or
improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels.

 

Generally, the Companies drydock each vessel every 60 months until the vessel
is 15 years old and every 30 months thereafter, as required for the renewal
of certifications issued by classification societies. For vessels operating on
time charters, the Companies capitalize the costs directly associated with the
classification and regulatory requirements for inspection of the vessels,
major repairs and improvements incurred during drydocking. Drydock cost is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the period until the next planned
drydocking takes place. The Companies expense costs related to routine repairs
and maintenance performed during drydocking or as otherwise incurred. For
vessels that are newly built or acquired, an element of the cost of the vessel
is initially allocated to a drydock component and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the period until the next planned drydocking. When significant
drydocking expenditures occur prior to the expiration of this period, the
Companies expense the remaining unamortized balance of the original drydocking
cost in the month of the subsequent drydocking. For vessels operating on
bareboat charters, the charter party bears the cost of any drydocking.

Depreciation on vessels and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the assets estimated useful life, less an estimated residual value, as
follows:



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  | Useful Life | 
    

Hull

 |  |  | 25 years | 
  

Anchor-handling, loading and unloading equipment

 |  |  | 25 years | 
  

Main/auxiliary engine

 |  |  | 25 years | 
  

Thruster, dynamic positioning systems, cranes and other equipment

 |  |  | 25 years | 
  

Drydock costs

 |  |  | 2.55 years | 
 

A Vessel is depreciated to its estimated residual value, which is calculated
based on the weight of the ship and estimated steel price. Any cost related
to the disposal is deducted from the residual value.

_(k) Capitalized Interest_

 

Interest expense incurred on the Companies debt during the construction of
the Vessels exceeding one year is capitalized during the construction period.

_(l) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_

 

Vessels and equipment, vessels under construction and intangible assets
subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group
to be tested for possible impairment, the Companies first compare undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its
carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group
is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is
recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair
value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted
cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals,
as considered necessary.

 



8 _(m) Debt Issuance Costs_

 

Debt issuance costs, including fees, commissions and legal expenses, are
deferred. Debt issuance costs of term loans are amortized over the term of
the relevant loan. Amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest
expense.

_(n) Income Taxes_

 

The tax expense in the income statement includes both tax payable and changes
in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at 28% on the basis of temporary
differences between accounting and tax values and tax loss carried forward at
the year end. Tax increasing and tax reducing temporary differences which
reverse or may be reversed in the same period are assessed and netted. The
Companies are subject to the Norwegian Tonnage Tax regime ("the tonnage tax
regime"). Under the tonnage tax regime, the tax is based on the tonnage of the
vessel and the operating income is tax free. The net financial income and
expense remains taxable as ordinary income tax for entities subject to the
tonnage tax regime. Tonnage tax is classified as an operating expense. To be
within the scheme the Companies should meet certain requirements, such as only
ownership of ship/ shares in the shipping companies, and only own certain
types of financial assets.

_(o) Prepaid Charter and Deferred Revenue_

 

Under terms of the time charters, the customer pays for the months charter
the first day of each month and that is recorded as prepaid charter revenues.
Deferred revenues for fees received from customers for customized equipment
are classified as prepaid charter and deferred revenue for the current portion
and as other long-term liabilities for the non-current portion.

 

 _(p) Commitments, Contingencies and Insurance Proceeds_

 

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it
is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss
contingencies are expensed as incurred. See Note 14Commitments and
Contingencies.

 

Insurance claims for property damage for recoveries up to the amount of loss
recognized are recorded when the claims submitted to insurance carriers are
probable of recovery. Claims for property damage in excess of the loss
recognized and for loss off-hire are considered gain contingencies, which are
generally recognized when the proceeds are received.

 

 _(q) Fair Value Measurements_

The Companies utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
possible. The Companies determines fair value based on assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or
most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in
fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes
between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of
the following levels:



     |  |  | _Level 1 Inputs:_ Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity
at the measurement date. 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | _Level 2 Inputs:_ Other than quoted prices included in
Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | _Level 3 Inputs:_ Unobservable inputs for the asset or
liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are
not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little,
if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
---|---|---|--- 

_(r) Recently Issued Accounting Standards_

 

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-04, Fair Value measurement (Topic
820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure
Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ("ASU 2011-04"). The new standards do not
extend the use of fair value but, rather, provide guidance about how fair
value should be applied where it already is required or permitted under
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") or U.S. GAAP. For U.S.
GAAP, most of the changes are clarifications of existing guidance or
wording changes to align with IFRS. A public entity is required to apply ASC
2011-04 prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December
5, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have a material impact on the
Companies combined financial statements.

In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, _Balance Sheet (Topic 210):
Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities_ ("ASU 2011-11"). ASU
2011-11 requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and
related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the
effect of those arrangements on its financial position, and to allow
investors to better compare financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP with
financial statements prepared under IFRS. The new standards are effective for
annual periods beginning January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Retrospective application is required. The Companies adopted
the provisions of ASU 2011-11 as of January 1, 2013. The adoption of ASU
2011-11 did not have a material impact on the Companies combined financial
statements.

 



9 In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, _Reporting of Amounts
Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income_ ("ASU 2013-02").
ASU 2013-02 requires reporting and disclosure about changes in accumulated
other comprehensive income ("AOCI") balances and reclassifications out of
AOCI. For public companies, the ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal
years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15,
2012. The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not have a material impact on the
Companies combined financial statements.

There are no recent accounting pronouncements issued whose adoption would have
a material impact on the Companies financial statements in the current year
or are expected to have a material impact on future years.

3) Significant Risks and Uncertainties Including Business and Credit
Concentrations

Each of the Vessels is currently employed under long-term fixed charters,
which mitigates earnings risk. The Companies operational results are
dependent on the worldwide market for shuttle tankers and timing of entrance
into long-term charters. Market conditions for shipping activities are
typically volatile, and, as a consequence, the hire rates may vary from year
to year. The market is mainly dependent upon two factors: the supply of
vessels and the overall growth in the world economy. The general supply of
vessels is a combination of newbuilds, demolition activity of older
vessels and legislation that limits the use of older vessels or new standards
for vessels used in specific trades.

The Companies did not incur any loss relating to their customers during the
years ended December 31, 2013, and 2012.

The following table presents revenues and percentage of combined revenues for
customers that accounted for more than 10% of the combined revenues during the
years ended December 31, 2013, and 2012.



      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Eni Trading and Shipping S.p.A

 |  | $ | 12,451 |  |  |  | 100 | % |  | $ |   |  |
 |  | 0 | % 
 

The Companies have financial assets that expose them to credit risk arising
from possible default by a counterparty. The Companies consider their
counterparties to be creditworthy financial institutions and do not expect any
significant loss to result from non-performance by such counterparties. The
maximum loss due to credit risk that the Companies would incur if
counterparties failed completely to perform would be the carrying value of
cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Companies, in the
normal course of business, do not demand collateral from their
counterparties. 

4) Operating Leases

The time charters of the vessels with third parties are accounted for as
operating leases. The minimum contractual future revenues to be received from
time charters as of December 31, 2013, were as follows:

to extend until August 2023. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Knutsen Shuttle Tanker 15 AS owns the vessel, _Torill
Knutsen_ , a shuttle tanker built in 2013 that is currently operating under a
time charter that expires in November 2018, with Eni, with five one-year-
options to extend until November 2023. In the case of the charter for the
_Torill Knutsen_ , Eni has the option, at any time before May 31, 2016, extend
the charter term to ten years in exchange for a reduction in the hire rate. 
---|---|---|--- 
 

5) Segment Information

The Companies have not presented segment information as they consider their
operations to occur in one reportable segment, the shuttle tanker market. In
time charters, the charterer, not the Companies, controls the choice of which
trading areas the vessel will serve. Accordingly, the Companies management,
including the chief operating decision makers, does not evaluate performance
according to geographical region.

 

During 2013, the vessels operated under two charters. See Note 3Significant
Risks and Uncertainties Including Business and Credit Concentrations for
revenues from customers accounting for over 10% of the combined revenue. In
both time charters, the charterer controls the choice of which trading areas
the Vessels will serve. Accordingly, the Companies management, including the
chief decision makers, do not evaluate performance according to geographical
region.

7) Fair Value Measurements

 

 _(a) Fair Value of Financial Instruments_

 

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of
the Companies financial instruments as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Fair
value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date.

 



      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  | December 31, 2013 |  |  | December 31, 2012 | 
   _(U.S. Dollars in thousands)_  |  | Carrying 
Amount |  |  | Fair Value |  |  | Carrying 
Amount |  |  | Fair 
Value | 
    

Financial assets:

 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
  

Cash and cash equivalents

 |  | $ | 11,841 |  |  | $ | 11,841 |  |  | $ | 228 |
 |  | $ | 228 | 
  

Financial liabilities:

 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
  

Long-term debt, current and non-current

 |  |  | 231,563 |  |  |  | 232,894 |  |  |  |
75,707 |  |  |  | 74,162 | 
 

The carrying amounts shown in the table above are included in the Companies
balance sheets under the indicated captions. The carrying value of trade
accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and receivables/payables to owners
and affiliates approximate their fair value.

 

The fair values of the financial instruments shown in the above table as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012 represent the amounts that would be received to
sell those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an
orderly transaction between market participants at that date. Those fair value
measurements maximize the use of observable inputs. However, in
situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the
Companies own judgment about the assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing the asset or liability. Those judgments are developed by the
Companies based on the best information available in the circumstances,
including expected cash flows, appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates and
available observable and unobservable inputs.

 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments:

 



     |  |  | _Cash and cash equivalents_ : The fair value of the
Companies cash balances approximates the carrying amounts due to the current
nature of the amounts. 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | _Long-term debt_ : With respect to long-term debt
measurements, the Companies use market interest rates and adjust that rate for
all necessary risks, including its own credit risk. In determining an
appropriate spread to reflect its credit standing, the Companies considered
interest rates currently offered to KNOT for similar debt instruments of
comparable maturities by KNOTs and the Companies bankers as well as other
banks that regularly compete to provide financing to the Companies. 
---|---|---|--- 
 



11 _(b) Fair Value Hierarchy_

 

The following table presents the placement in the fair value hierarchy of
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
(including items that are required to be measured at fair value or for which
fair value is required to be disclosed) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012:

The Companies accounting policy is to recognize transfers between levels of
the fair value hierarchy on the date of the event or change in circumstances
that caused the transfer. There were no transfers into or out of Level 1,
Level 2 or Level 3 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

 

8) Trade Accounts Receivables

12) Income Taxes

 

 _Components of Current and Deferred Tax Expense (Benefit)_

 

The Companies are subject to the Norwegian Tonnage Tax regime ("the tonnage
tax regime"). Under the tonnage tax regime, the tax is based on the tonnage
of the vessel and the operating income is tax free. The net financial income
and expense remains taxable as ordinary income tax for entities subject to the
tonnage tax regime. Tonnage tax is classified as an operating
expense. Tonnage tax amounted to $13,000 in 2013 and $0.0 in 2012.

A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more
likely than not that some of or all of the benefit from the deferred tax
asset will not be realized. The valuation allowances relate to the financial
loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets for tonnage tax that, in the
judgment of the Companies, are more-likely-than not to be realized reflecting
the Companies cumulative loss position for tonnage tax. In assessing the
realizability of deferred tax assets, the Companies consider whether it is
more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized taking into account all the positive and negative evidence
available, and there is no deferred tax assets recognized as of December 31,
2013 and December 31, 2012.

 

The financial loss carry forwards for tonnage tax have no expiration dates.

 

The Companies Norwegian income tax returns are subject to examination by
Norwegian tax authorities going back ten years from 2013. The Companies had
no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. During the
years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Companies did not incur any
interest or penalties on its tax regime.

14) Commitments and Contingencies

 

 _Assets Pledged_

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Vessels with a book value of $ 287.5
million and $ 126.7 million, respectively, were pledged as security held as
guarantee for the Companies long-term debt obligations. See Note 11Long-
Term Debt.

_Insurance_

The Companies maintain insurance to insure against marine and war risks,
which include damage to or total loss of the Vessels, subject to deductible
amounts that average $0.150 million per Vessel, and loss of hire.

 

Under the loss of hire policies, the insurer will pay a compensation for the
lost hire rate agreed in respect of each Vessel for each day, in excess of 14
deductible days, for the time that the Vessel is out of service as a result of
damage, for a maximum of 180 days. In addition, the Companies maintain
protection and indemnity insurance, which covers third-party legal liabilities
arising in connection with the Vessels activities, including, among other
things, the injury or death of third-party persons, loss or damage to cargo,
claims arising from collisions with other vessels and other damage to other
third-party property, including pollution arising from oil or other
substances. This insurance is unlimited, except for pollution, which is
limited to $1 billion per vessel per incident. The protection and indemnity
insurance is maintained through a protection and indemnity association, and
as a member of the association, the Companies may be required to pay amounts
above budgeted premiums if the member claims exceed association reserves,
subject to certain reinsured amounts. If the Companies experience multiple
claims each with individual deductibles, losses due to risks that are not
insured or claims for insured risks that are not paid, it could have a
material adverse effect on the Companies results of operations and financial
condition.

22 1) Description of Business

 

Knutsen Shuttle Tankers 14 AS and Knutsen Shuttle Tankers 15 AS (hereafter
referred as the "Companies") own the 123,000 DWT Suez-max shuttle tanker,
_Hilda Knutsen_ , and the 123,000 DWT Suez-max shuttle tanker, _Torill
Knutsen_ , respectively, delivered from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI)
Shipyard in South Korea on August 5, 2013 and November 4, 2013.

 

Knutsen Shuttle Tankers 14 AS was established on March 25, 2011 to take
ownership of one building contract for one 123,000 DWT Suez-max shuttle
tanker, _Hilda Knutsen,_ delivered on August 5, 2013. Knutsen Shuttle Tankers
15 AS was established on June 1, 2011 to take ownership of one building
contract for one 123,000 DWT Suez-max shuttle tanker, _Torill Knutsen, _
delivered on November 4, 2013. Both the _Hilda Knutsen_ and the _Torill
Knutsen_ (the "Vessels") are on time-charter contracts to Eni Trading and
Shipping S.p.A. ("Eni"), for operation primarily on the Goliat offshore oil
field outside northern Norway on a five-year time-charter agreement with five
one-year-options. In the case of the charter for the _Torill Knutsen_ , Eni
has the option, at any time before May 31, 2016, to extend the charter term
to ten years in exchange for a reduction in the hire rate.

The Companies are owned by Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers AS ("KNOT"), and are
operating as an integrated part of KNOT. KNOT is owned 50% by TS Shipping
Invest AS ("TSSI") and 50% by Nippon Yusen Kaisha ("NYK"). Technical and
commercial management of the vessels have been subcontracted to Knutsen OAS
Shipping AS ("KOAS") up to July 1, 2012 and thereafter by KNOT Management AS,
a 100% owned subsidiary of KNOT. KOAS is controlled 99% by TSSI.

 

There are no employees in the Companies and daily operation is managed by KNOT
Management AS.

 

2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

_(a) Basis of Preparation_

The combined financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP").

_(b) Reporting Currency_

 

The combined financial statements are prepared in the reporting currency of
U.S. Dollars. The functional currency of the Companies is the U.S. Dollar,
because both entities operate in the international shipping market all
revenues are U.S. Dollars denominated and the majority of the expenditures are
made in U.S. Dollars. Transactions involving other currencies during the year
are converted into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the
time of the transactions. As of the balance sheet dates, monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are
translated to reflect the year-end exchange rates. Resulting gains and losses
are reflected separately in the accompanying combined statements of
operations.

_(c) Use of Estimates_

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates
and assumptions include the useful lives and impairment of Vessels,
drydocking, and income taxes.

 

 _(d) Revenues and Operating Expenses_

 

The Companies recognize revenues from time charters as operating leases on a
straight-line basis over the term of the charter, net of any commissions.
Under time charters, revenue is not recognized during days the Vessel is off-
hire. Revenue is recognized from delivery of the Vessel to the charterer,
until the end of the contract period. Under time charters, the Companies
are responsible for providing the crewing and other services related to the
Vessels operations, the cost of which is included in the daily hire rate,
except when off-hire. Fees received from customers for customized equipment
are deferred and recognized over the contract period. The Companies recognize
revenues from spot contracts as voyage revenues using the percentage of
completion method on a discharge-to-discharge basis.

 

Voyage expenses are all expenses unique to a particular voyage, including
bunker fuel expenses, port fees, cargo loading and unloading expenses, canal
tolls and agency fees. Voyage expenses are paid by the customer under time
charters.

Vessel operating expenses include crewing, repairs and maintenance,
insurance, stores, lube oils and communication expenses. Vessel operating
expenses are paid by the Companies for time charters and during off-hire and
are recognized when incurred. As further discussed in Note 14Related Party
Transactions, related parties have provided the management services for the
Vessels and employ the crews that work on the Vessels. The Companies have no
direct employees and, accordingly, are not liable for any pension or post-
retirement benefits.

_(e) Financial Income (Expense)_

 

Interest expenses incurred on the Companies debt incurred during the
construction of the Vessels exceeding one year are capitalized during the
construction period.

 



23 _(f) Cash and Cash Equivalents_

 

The Companies consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

_(g) Trade Accounts Receivable_

 

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
interest. Under terms of the current time charters, the customers
are committed to pay for the full months charter the first day of each
month. See Note 2(p) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Prepaid
Charter and Deferred Revenue. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
Companies best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing
accounts receivable. The Companies establish provisions for doubtful accounts
on a case-by-case basis when it is unlikely that required payments of specific
amounts will occur. In establishing these provisions, the Companies consider
the financial condition of the customer as well as specific circumstances
related to the receivable. Receivable amounts determined to be unrecoverable
are written-off. There were no provisions as allowance for doubtful accounts
or amounts written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as of March
31, 2014. The Companies do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure
related to their customers.

 

 _(h) Inventories_

Inventories, which are comprised principally of lubricating oils, are stated
at the lower of cost or market. For vessels on time charters, there are no
bunkers, as the charterer supplies the bunkers, which principally consist of
fuel oil. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method for all
inventories.

_(i) Other Current Assets_

 

Other current assets principally consist of prepaid expenses, the current
portion of deferred cost and other receivables.

 

 _(j) Vessels and Equipment_

Vessels and equipment are stated at the historical acquisition or
construction cost, including capitalized interest, supervision and technical
and delivery cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if
any. Expenditures for subsequent conversions and major improvements are
capitalized, provided that such costs increase the earnings capacity or
improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels.

 

Generally, the Companies drydock each vessel every 60 months until the vessel
is 15 years old and every 30 months thereafter, as required for the renewal
of certifications issued by classification societies. For vessels operating on
time charters, the Companies capitalize the costs directly associated with the
classification and regulatory requirements for inspection of the vessels,
major repairs and improvements incurred during drydocking. Drydock cost is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the period until the next planned
drydocking takes place. The Companies expense costs related to routine repairs
and maintenance performed during drydocking or as otherwise incurred. For
vessels that are newly built or acquired, an element of the cost of the vessel
is initially allocated to a drydock component and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the period until the next planned drydocking. When significant
drydocking expenditures occur prior to the expiration of this period, the
Companies expense the remaining unamortized balance of the original drydocking
cost in the month of the subsequent drydocking. For vessels operating on
bareboat charters, the charter party bears the cost of any drydocking.

Depreciation on vessels and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the assets estimated useful life, less an estimated residual value, as
follows:



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  | Useful Life | 
    

Hull

 |  |  | 25 years | 
  

Anchor-handling, loading and unloading equipment

 |  |  | 25 years | 
  

Main/auxiliary engine

 |  |  | 25 years | 
  

Thruster, dynamic positioning systems, cranes and other equipment

 |  |  | 25 years | 
  

Drydock costs

 |  |  | 2.55 years | 
 

A vessel is depreciated to its estimated residual value, which is calculated
based on the weight of the ship and estimated steel price. Any cost related
to the disposal is deducted from the residual value.

_(k) Capitalized Interest_

 

Interest expense incurred on the Companies debt during the construction of
the Vessels exceeding one year is capitalized during the construction period.

_(l) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_

 

Vessels and equipment, vessels under construction and intangible assets
subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group
to be tested for possible impairment, the Companies first compare undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its
carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group
is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is
recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair
value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted
cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals,
as considered necessary.

 



24 _(m) Debt Issuance Costs_

 

Debt issuance costs, including fees, commissions and legal expenses, are
deferred. Debt issuance costs of term loans are amortized over the term of
the relevant loan. Amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest
expense.

_(n) Derivative Instruments_

 

All derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value as either
assets or liabilities in the accompanying combined balance sheets
and subsequently measured to fair value. The Companies do not apply hedge
accounting to their derivative instruments. Changes in the fair value of the
derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses from the
interest rate swap contracts of the Companies related to long-term mortgage
debt are recorded in realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivative
instruments in the combined statements of operations. Cash flows related to
interest rate swap contracts are presented as cash flows provided by
operating activities in the combined statements of cash flows.

_(o) Income Taxes_

 

The tax expense in the income statement includes both tax payable and changes
in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at 28% on the basis of temporary
differences between accounting and tax values and tax loss carried forward at
the year end. Tax increasing and tax reducing temporary differences which
reverse or may be reversed in the same period are assessed and netted. The
Companies are subject to the Norwegian Tonnage Tax regime ("the tonnage tax
regime"). Under the tonnage tax regime, the tax is based on the tonnage of the
vessel and the operating income is tax free. The net financial income and
expense remains taxable as ordinary income tax for entities subject to the
tonnage tax regime. Tonnage tax is classified as an operating expense. To be
within the scheme the Companies should meet certain requirements, such as only
ownership of ship/ shares in the shipping companies, and only own certain
types of financial assets.

_(p) Prepaid Charter and Deferred Revenue_

 

Under terms of the time charters, the customer pays for the months charter
the first day of each month and that is recorded as prepaid charter revenues.
Deferred revenues for fees received from customers for customized equipment
are classified as prepaid charter and deferred revenue for the current portion
and as other long-term liabilities for the non-current portion.

 

 _(q) Commitments, Contingencies and Insurance Proceeds_

 

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it
is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss
contingencies are expensed as incurred. See Note 15Commitments and
Contingencies.

 

Insurance claims for property damage for recoveries up to the amount of loss
recognized are recorded when the claims submitted to insurance carriers are
probable of recovery. Claims for property damage in excess of the loss
recognized and for loss off-hire are considered gain contingencies, which are
generally recognized when the proceeds are received.

 

 _(r) Fair Value Measurements_

The Companies utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
possible. The Companies determines fair value based on assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or
most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in
fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes
between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of
the following levels:



     |  |  | _Level 1 Inputs:_ Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity
at the measurement date. 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | _Level 2 Inputs:_ Other than quoted prices included in
Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | _Level 3 Inputs:_ Unobservable inputs for the asset or
liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are
not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little,
if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
---|---|---|--- 

_(s) Recently Issued Accounting Standards_

 

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-04, Fair Value measurement (Topic
820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure
Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ("ASU 2011-04"). The new standards do not
extend the use of fair value but, rather, provide guidance about how fair
value should be applied where it already is required or permitted under
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") or U.S. GAAP. For U.S.
GAAP, most of the changes are clarifications of existing guidance or
wording changes to align with IFRS. A public entity is required to apply ASC
2011-04 prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December
5, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have a material impact on the
Companies combined financial statements.

 



25 In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, _Balance Sheet (Topic 210):
Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities_ ("ASU 2011-11"). ASU
2011-11 requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and
related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the
effect of those arrangements on its financial position, and to allow
investors to better compare financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP with
financial statements prepared under IFRS. The new standards are effective for
annual periods beginning January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Retrospective application is required. The Companies adopted
the provisions of ASU 2011-11 as of January 1, 2013. The adoption of ASU
2011-11 did not have a material impact on the Companies combined financial
statements.

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, _Reporting of
Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income_ ("ASU
2013-02"). ASU 2013-02 requires reporting and disclosure about changes in
accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") balances and reclassifications
out of AOCI. For public companies, the ASU is effective prospectively for
fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December
15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not have a material impact on the
Companies combined financial statements.

There are no recent accounting pronouncements issued whose adoption would have
a material impact on the Companies financial statements in the current year
or are expected to have a material impact on future years.

3) Significant Risks and Uncertainties Including Business and Credit
Concentrations

Each of the Vessels is currently employed under long-term fixed
charters, which mitigates earnings risk. The Companies operational results
are dependent on the worldwide market for shuttle tankers and timing of
entrance into long-term charters. Market conditions for shipping activities
are typically volatile, and, as a consequence, the hire rates may vary from
year to year. The market is mainly dependent upon two factors: the supply of
vessels and the overall growth in the world economy. The general supply of
vessels is a combination of newbuilds, demolition activity of older vessels
and legislation that limits the use of older vessels or new standards for
vessels used in specific trades.

The Companies did not incur any loss relating to their customers during the
three months ended March 31, 2014. The following table presents revenues and
percentage of combined revenues for customers that accounted for more than 10%
of the combined revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and
2013.

from possible default by a counterparty. The Companies consider their
counterparties to be creditworthy financial institutions and do not expect any
significant loss to result from non-performance by such counterparties. The
maximum loss due to credit risk that the Companies would incur if
counterparties failed completely to perform would be the carrying value of
cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Companies, in the
normal course of business, do not demand collateral from their
counterparties. 

4) Operating Leases

The time charters of the vessels with third parties are accounted for as
operating leases. The minimum contractual future revenues to be received from
time charters as of March 31, 2014, were as follows:

26 5) Segment Information

 

The Companies have not presented segment information as they consider their
operations to occur in one reportable segment, the shuttle tanker market. In
time charters, the charterer, not the Companies, controls the choice of which
trading areas the vessel will serve. Accordingly, the Companies management,
including the chief operating decision makers, does not evaluate
performance according to geographical region.

For the three month ended period as of March 31, 2014, the vessels operated
under two charters. See Note 3- Significant Risks and Uncertainties Including
Business and Credit Concentrations for revenues from customers accounting for
over 10% of the combined revenue. In both time charters, the charterer
controls the choice of which trading areas the Vessels will serve.
Accordingly, the Companies management, including the chief decision makers,
do not evaluate performance according to geographical region.

_7) Derivative Instruments_

 

 _Interest Rate Risk Management_

In February 2014, the Companies entered into interest rate swap agreements
effective from July, 2014 and until July 2018, for a total notional amount of
$100 million to hedge against the interest rate risks of their variable rate
borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the
Companies will receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount
based on three-month LIBOR and will pay to the counterparty a fixed rate. For
the interest rate swap agreements above, the Companies will pay to the
counterparty a fixed rate of 1.455%.

The combined financial statements include the results of interest rate swap
contracts to manage the Companies exposure related to changes in interest
rates on its variable rate debt instruments. The Companies does not apply
hedge accounting for derivative instruments. The Companies do not speculate
using derivative instruments.

By using derivative financial instruments to economically hedge exposures to
changes in interest rates, the Companies expose itself to credit risk and
market risk. Derivative instruments that economically hedge exposures are used
for risk management purposes, but these instruments are not designated as
hedges for accounting purposes. Credit risk is the failure of the
counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative instrument. When the
fair value of a derivative instrument is positive, the counterparty owes the
Companies, which creates credit risk for the Companies. When the fair value
of a derivative instrument is negative, the Companies owe the counterparty,
and, therefore, the Companies are not exposed to the counterpartys credit
risk in those circumstances. The Companies minimizes counterparty credit risk
in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with major banking
and financial institutions. The derivative instruments entered into by the
Companies do not contain credit risk-related contingent features.

 



27 Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a derivative instrument that
results from a change in interest rates, currency exchange rates or commodity
prices. The market risk associated with interest rate contracts is managed by
establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of
market risk that may be undertaken.

The Companies assesses interest rate risk by monitoring changes in interest
rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by
evaluating economical hedging opportunities.

The variable interest rate mortgage debt obligations expose the Companies to
variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. The
Companies believes that it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of
its interest payments. To meet this objective, the Companies entered into
London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")-based interest rate swap contracts to
manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the benchmark
interest rate of LIBOR. These swaps change the variable rate cash flow
exposure on the mortgage debt obligations to fixed cash flows. Under the
terms of the interest rate swap contracts, the Companies receive LIBOR-based
variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments, thereby
creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt for the notional amount of their
debt hedged.

As of March 31, 2014, the total notional amount of the Companies
outstanding interest rate swap contracts that were entered into in order to
hedge outstanding or forecasted debt obligations were $100 million. As of
March 31, 2014, the carrying amount of the interest rate swaps contracts were
net assets of $0.7 million. See Note 8Fair Value Measurements.

Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts are reported in
realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the same
period in which the related interest affects earnings.

The Companies did not have any interest rate swap agreements as of March 31,
2013.

The following table presents the realized and unrealized gains and losses
that are recognized in earnings as net gain (loss) on derivative instruments
for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.

8) Fair Value Measurements

 

 _(a) Fair Value of Financial Instruments_

 

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of
the Companies financial instruments as of March 31, 2014 and 2013. Fair
value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date.

28 The carrying amounts shown in the table above are included in the Companies
balance sheets under the indicated captions. The carrying value of trade
accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and receivables/payables to owners
and affiliates approximate their fair value.

 

The fair values of the financial instruments shown in the above table as of
March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 represent the amounts that would be
received to sell those assets or that would be paid to transfer those
liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at that
date. Those fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs.
However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the
asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement
reflects the Companies own judgment about the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Those judgments are
developed by the Companies based on the best information available in the
circumstances, including expected cash flows, appropriately risk-adjusted
discount rates and available observable and unobservable inputs.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments:

 



    |  | _Cash and cash equivalents_ : The fair value of the
Companies cash balances approximates the carrying amounts due to the current
nature of the amounts. 
---|---|--- 
 



    |  | _Interest rate swap contracts:_ The fair value of interest-
rate swaps is determined using an income approach using the following
significant inputs: the term of the swap, the notional amount of the swap,
discount rates interpolated based on relevant LIBOR swap curves and the rate
on the fixed leg of the swap. 
---|---|--- 



    |  | _Long-term debt_ : With respect to long-term debt
measurements, the Companies use market interest rates and adjust that rate for
all necessary risks, including its own credit risk. In determining an
appropriate spread to reflect its credit standing, the Companies considered
interest rates currently offered to KNOT for similar debt instruments of
comparable maturities by KNOTs and the Companies bankers as well as other
banks that regularly compete to provide financing to the Companies. 
---|---|--- 

_(b) Fair Value Hierarchy_

_Hilda Facility_

 

The $117 million secured loan facility (the "Hilda Facility") is repayable in
quarterly installments over five years with a final balloon payment due at
maturity in August 2018. The Hilda Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a
fixed margin of 2.5%.

The _Hilda Knutsen_ , assignments of earnings, charterparty contracts and
insurance proceeds are pledged as collateral for the Hilda Facility. KNOT is
the sole guarantor.

 

The Hilda Facility contains the following financial covenants:



     |  |  | Market value of the _Hilda Knutsen_ to be no less than
100% of the outstanding balance under the Hilda Facility for the first 4 years
and 125% for the 5th year;  
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Positive working capital of the borrower and of KNOT and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis ("KNOT Group");

13) Income Taxes

 

 _Components of Current and Deferred Tax Expense (Benefit)_

 

The Companies are subject to the Norwegian Tonnage Tax regime ("the tonnage
tax regime"). Under the tonnage tax regime, the tax is based on the tonnage
of the vessel and the operating income is tax free. The net financial income
and expense remains taxable as ordinary income tax for entities subject to the
tonnage tax regime. Tonnage tax is classified as an operating
expense. Tonnage tax amounted to $11,000 in the three months ended March 31,
2014, and $0 in the three months ended March 31, 2013.

A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more
likely than not that some of or all of the benefit from the deferred tax
asset will not be realized. The valuation allowances relate to the financial
loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets for tonnage tax that, in the
judgment of the Companies, are more-likely-than not to be realized reflecting
the Companies cumulative loss position for tonnage tax. In assessing the
realizability of deferred tax assets, the Companies consider whether it is
more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized taking into account all the positive and negative evidence
available, and there is no deferred tax assets recognized as of March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013.

15) Commitments and Contingencies

 

 _Assets Pledged_

As of March 31, 2014, Vessels with a book value of $ 281.5 million were
pledged as security held as guarantee for the Companies long-term debt and
interest rate obligations. See Note 7  Derivative Instruments and
Note 12Long-Term Debt.

_Insurance_

 

The Companies maintain insurance to insure against marine and war risks, which
include damage to or total loss of the Vessels, subject to deductible amounts
that average $0.150 million per Vessel, and loss of hire.

Under the loss of hire policies, the insurer will pay a compensation for the
lost hire rate agreed in respect of each Vessel for each day, in excess of 14
deductible days, for the time that the Vessel is out of service as a result of
damage, for a maximum of 180 days. In addition, the Companies
maintain protection and indemnity insurance, which covers third-party legal
liabilities arising in connection with the Vessels activities, including,
among other things, the injury or death of third-party persons, loss or damage
to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels and other damage
to other third-party property, including pollution arising from oil or other
substances. This insurance is unlimited, except for pollution, which is
limited to $1 billion per vessel per incident. The protection and indemnity
insurance is maintained through a protection and indemnity association, and as
a member of the association, the Companies may be required to pay amounts
above budgeted premiums if the member claims exceed association reserves,
subject to certain reinsured amounts. If the Companies experience multiple
claims each with individual deductibles, losses due to risks that are not
insured or claims for insured risks that are not paid, it could have
a material adverse effect on the Companies results of operations and
financial condition.
