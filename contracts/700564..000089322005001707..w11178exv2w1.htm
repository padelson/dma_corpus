Agreement and Plan of Merger 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER made as of the 26th day of July, 2005, by and between FULTON FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania business corporation having its administrative headquarters at One Penn Square, P.O. Box 4887, Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17604 ("Fulton"), and COLUMBIA BANCORP, a Maryland corporation having its administrative headquarters at 7168 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia, Maryland 21046 ("Columbia"). 

  

BACKGROUND: 

   

 Fulton is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). Columbia is a bank holding company registered under the BHC Act and is the parent of The Columbia Bank, a Maryland trust company ("The Columbia Bank"). In addition to The Columbia Bank, Columbia has three 100% directly owned subsidiaries: Columbia Bancorp Statutory Trust I, Columbia Bancorp Statutory Trust II and Columbia Bancorp Statutory Trust III, which were formed in connection with Columbias issuance of trust preferred securities (the "Columbia Trust Preferred Securities"). The Columbia Bank has four 100% directly owned subsidiaries: McAlpine Enterprises, Inc., Howard I, LLC and Howard II, LLC, which are used primarily to manage properties acquired through foreclosure, and Columbia Leasing, Inc., which is an inactive commercial leasing company. The Columbia Bank and all other wholly-owned subsidiaries of Columbia and The Columbia Bank are collectively referred to herein as the "Columbia Subsidiaries". The Boards of Directors of Fulton and Columbia have determined that it is in the best interests of Fulton and Columbia, respectively, to merge with each other, resulting in The Columbia Bank becoming a subsidiary of Fulton. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the foregoing transaction will be accomplished by means of a merger (the "Merger") in which (i) Columbia will be merged with and into Fulton, (ii) Fulton will survive the Merger, and (iii) all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Columbia, $ .01 par value per share ("Columbia Common Stock"), will be converted into cash and shares of the common stock of Fulton, par value $2.50 per share, and the associated Fulton Rights (as such term is defined in Section 2.1 herein) ("Fulton Common Stock") on the terms described in this Agreement. 

  

 In connection with the execution of this Agreement, the parties are to enter into a Warrant Agreement in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the "Warrant Agreement"), which provides for the delivery by Columbia of a warrant in substantially the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the "Warrant") entitling Fulton to purchase shares of Columbia Common Stock in certain circumstances. In addition, Columbia has obtained voting agreements in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto, from the directors and executive officers listed on  _Exhibit C_, who have agreed to vote shares of voting capital stock beneficially owned by them in Columbia in favor of this Agreement, the Merger and, to the extent required, all transactions incident thereto (collectively, the "Voting Agreements"). 

  

WITNESSETH: 

   

 _NOW, THEREFORE_ , in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I  THE MERGER 

   

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Columbia shall merge with and into Fulton in accordance with the following: 

  

 Section 1.1 Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 9.2 herein) (i) Columbia shall merge with and into Fulton pursuant to the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the "BCL"), and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "GCL"), whereupon the separate existence of Columbia shall cease, and Fulton shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"), and (ii) all of the outstanding shares of Columbia Common Stock will be converted into Fulton Common Stock and cash in accordance with the provisions of Article II hereof. 

  

 Section 1.2 Name. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Fulton Financial Corporation". The address of the principal office of the Surviving Corporation will be One Penn Square, P.O. Box 4887, Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17604. 

  

 Section 1.3 Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation of Fulton as in effect at the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 1.4 Bylaws. The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Bylaws of Fulton as in effect at the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors and officers of Fulton in office at the Effective Time. Each of such directors and officers shall serve until such time as his successor is duly elected and has qualified. 

  

ARTICLE II  CONVERSION OF SHARES AND EXCHANGE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES 

   

 Section 2.1 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 9.2 herein) the shares of Columbia Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted into shares of Fulton Common Stock and cash, as follows: 

   

 (a) _Conversion of Columbia Shares_. Except as set forth in subsection (d) below, each share of Columbia Common Stock (a "Columbia Share") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to be outstanding and be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive, upon the surrender of the share certificates evidencing the Columbia Shares, the Fulton Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a combination of Fulton Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration, without any interest thereon, as specified in this Article II (the "Merger Consideration") in accordance with Section 2.2 herein. 

   

 (b) _Definitions_. For purposes hereof, the following terms have the following respective meanings: 

   ##### 

 

   

"Cash Consideration" means an amount in cash payable in the Merger at a rate
of $42.48 per Columbia Share. 

   

"Conversion Ratio" means 2.325. 

   

"Outstanding Shares" means the aggregate number of Columbia Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Columbia
Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(d), which number will not be
greater than the number of shares outstanding on the date of this Agreement
(except as permitted in Section 5.1 herein) 

   

"Fulton Rights" means rights to purchase common stock of Fulton distributed
to holders of common stock of Fulton pursuant to a Rights Agreement dated
June 20, 1989, as amended and restated as of April 27, 1999 (the "Fulton
Rights Agreement"). 

   

"Fulton Stock Consideration" means that number of shares of Fulton Common
Stock payable in the Merger at a rate of one share of Fulton Common Stock
multiplied by the Conversion Ratio per Columbia Share. In the event that
Fulton shall at any time before the Effective Time: (i) issue a dividend
payable in shares of Fulton Common Stock, (ii) combine the outstanding shares
of Fulton Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iii) subdivide
the outstanding shares of Fulton Common Stock into a greater number of
shares, then the Conversion Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted
(calculated to four decimal places), so that each Columbia stockholder shall
receive at the Effective Time, in exchange for his shares of Columbia
Common Stock, the number of shares of Fulton Common Stock as would then have
been owned by him if the Effective Time had occurred before the record date
of such event. For example, if Fulton were to declare a five percent (5%)
stock dividend after the date of this Agreement and if the record date for
that stock dividend were to occur before the Effective Time, the Conversion
Ratio would be adjusted from 2.325 to 2.413 shares. In the event that between
the date of this Agreement, and the Effective Time, the issued and
outstanding shares of Fulton Common Stock shall have been effected or changed
into a different number of shares or a different class of shares as a result
of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, spin-
off, extraordinary dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, subdivision,
combination of shares or other similar transaction, or there shall have been
a record date declared for any such matter, the Fulton Stock Consideration
shall be proportionately adjusted. 

   

"Stock Test Amount" means the product of (i) the number of Outstanding Shares
to be converted into Fulton Stock Consideration (determined after taking into
account adjustments under Section 2.2(b)(i)), multiplied by (ii) the
Conversion Ratio, multiplied by (iii) the Fulton Share Value. 

   

"Cash Test Amount" means the product of (i) the number of Outstanding Shares
to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
(determined 

   ##### 

  

   

after taking into account adjustments under Section 2.2(b)(i)), multiplied by
(ii) $42.48. 

   

"Fulton Share Value" means the lowest price at which a share of Fulton Common
Stock trades on NASDAQ on the Effective Date. 

   

 (c) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Fulton Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional share to which he would otherwise be entitled, each former stockholder of Columbia shall receive in cash an amount equal to the fair market value of his fractional interest, which fair market value shall be determined by multiplying such fraction by $42.48. 

   

 (d) _Cancelled Columbia Shares_. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1(a) herein, the following shares of Columbia Common Stock shall not be converted into Fulton Common Stock and shall be cancelled at the Effective Time: (i) shares of Columbia Common Stock then owned by Fulton or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Fulton (except for trust account shares or shares acquired in connection with debts previously contracted); and (ii) shares of Columbia Common Stock owned by Columbia or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Columbia (except for trust account shares or shares acquired in connection with debts previously contracted). 

   

 (e) _Closing Market Price_. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Closing Market Price" shall be the average of the per share closing bid and asked prices for Fulton Common Stock, calculated to two decimal places, for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date which is two (2) business days before the Effective Date (as such term is defined in Section 9.2 herein), as reported on the National Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ"), the foregoing period of ten (10) trading days being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Price Determination Period" (For example, if January 15, 2006 were to be the Effective Date, then the Price Determination Period would be December 29-30, 2005 and January 2-6 and January 9-11, 2006). In the event that NASDAQ shall fail to report closing bid and asked prices for Fulton Common Stock for any trading day during the Price Determination Period, the closing bid and asked prices for that day shall be equal to the average of the closing bid and asked prices as quoted: (i) by F. J. Morrissey and Company, Inc. and by Ryan, Beck and Co.; or (ii) in the event that both of these firms are not then making a market in Fulton Common Stock, by two brokerage firms then making a market in Fulton Common Stock to be selected by Fulton and approved by Columbia. 

  

 Section 2.2 Exchange of Stock Certificates. Columbia Common Stock certificates shall be exchanged for certificates evidencing the Fulton Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration in accordance with the following procedures: 

   

 (a) _Election Procedure_. Each holder of Columbia Shares (other than holders of Columbia Shares to be cancelled as set forth in Section 2.1(d)) shall have the right to submit a request specifying either that such holders Columbia Shares shall be converted into the 

   ##### 

  

   

Fulton Stock Consideration, Cash Consideration or a combination of
Cash Consideration and Fulton Stock Consideration, without interest, in the
Merger in accordance with the following procedures: 

   

 (i) Each holder of Columbia Shares may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2 (herein called an "Election") to either: (i) convert each Columbia Share owned by such holder into the right to receive the Fulton Stock Consideration in the Merger (a "Stock Election"); (ii) convert each Columbia Share owned by such holder into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger (a "Cash Election"); or (iii) convert a portion of the Columbia Shares owned by such holder into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger, and a portion of the Columbia Shares owned by such holder into the right to receive the Fulton Stock Consideration in the Merger, in such ratio of Fulton Stock Consideration to Cash Consideration of 90%/10% 80%/20%, 70%/30%, 60%/40%, 50%/50%, 40%/60%, 30%/70%, 20%/80%, 10%/90% (a "Cash/Stock Election"). A Form of Election (as defined below) shall be included with each copy of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 6.1(b)) mailed to stockholders of Columbia in connection with the meeting of stockholders called to consider the approval of this Agreement. Fulton and Columbia shall each use its reasonable best efforts to mail or otherwise make available the Form of Election to all persons who become holders of Columbia Shares during the period between the record date for such stockholder meeting and the Election Deadline (as defined in Section 2.2(a)(iv)). 

   

 (ii) Fulton shall prepare a form (the "Form of Election"), which shall be in form and substance acceptable to Columbia, pursuant to which each holder of Columbia Shares, no later than at the close of business on the Election Deadline, may make an Election and which shall be mailed to the Columbia stockholders in accordance with Section 2.2(a)(i) so as to permit Columbias stockholders to exercise their right to make an Election on or prior to the Election Deadline. 

   

 (iii) Holders of record of Columbia Shares who hold such shares as nominees, trustees, or in other representative capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election, provided that such representative certifies that each Form of Election covers all Columbia Shares held by such representative for a particular beneficial owner. 

   

 (iv) Not later than the filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as contemplated in Section 6.1(b) hereof, Fulton shall appoint Fulton Financial Advisors, National Association, as the person to receive Forms of Election and to act as exchange agent under this Agreement (the "Exchange Agent"). Any Columbia stockholders Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of such Exchange Agent is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates 

   ##### 

  

   

for the Columbia Shares to which such Form of Election relates (or by an
appropriate guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such
Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities
exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States provided
such certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time
required in such guarantee of delivery). Failure to deliver Columbia Shares
covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such
guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election.
As used herein, "Election Deadline" means the date announced by Fulton (which
date shall be agreed upon by Columbia), as the last day on which Forms of
Election will be accepted, which date shall be no more than ten (10) business
days before the Effective Time. In the event this Agreement shall have been
terminated prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall immediately
return all Forms of Election and certificates for Columbia Shares to the
appropriate Columbia stockholders. 

   

 (v) Any Columbia stockholder may at any time prior to the Election Deadline change his Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a revised Form of Election properly completed and signed. 

   

 (vi) Any Columbia stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his certificates for Columbia Shares, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Fulton or Columbia that this Agreement has been terminated. Any Columbia stockholder who shall have deposited certificates for Columbia Shares with the Exchange Agent shall have the right to withdraw such certificates by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline and thereby revoke his Election as of the Election Deadline if the Merger shall not have been consummated prior thereto. 

   

 (vii) Fulton and Columbia shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of the Forms of Election, the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 2.2, the issuance and delivery of certificates for Fulton Common Stock into which Columbia Shares are converted in the Merger and the payment of cash for Columbia Shares converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger. 

   

 (b) _Issuance of Fulton Stock Consideration and Payment of Cash Consideration; Proration_. The manner in which each Columbia Share (except Columbia Shares to be cancelled as set forth in Section 2.1(d)) shall be converted into the Fulton Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration or the right to receive a combination of Fulton 

   ##### 

  

   

Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration at the Effective Time shall be as
set forth in this Section 2.2(b) subject to the provisions of Section
2.2(b)(i)(A). 

   

 (i) As is more fully set forth below, the number of Columbia Shares to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of all Outstanding Shares (the "Maximum Cash Percentage") and shall not be less than twenty percent (20%) of all Outstanding Shares (the "Minimum Cash Percentage"); provided, however, that for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger should qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in order that the Merger will not fail to satisfy continuity of interest requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, as reasonably determined by Barley Snyder LLC, Fulton shall increase the number of Outstanding Shares that will be converted into the Fulton Stock Consideration and reduce the number of Outstanding Shares that will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration to the extent, if any, necessary to cause the Stock Test Amount to exceed the Cash Test Amount by at least $100.00 provided, however, that, solely for purposes of determining whether the Stock Test Amount exceeds the Cash Test Amount, shares issuable under Fulton Stock Options issued under Section 2.3 and cash paid for Columbia Options pursuant to Section 2.3 shall be disregarded. 

   

 (ii) If the percentage of Outstanding Shares for which a Cash Election is made (including the cash portion of any Cash/Stock Elections) exceeds the Minimum Cash Percentage and is less than the Maximum Cash Percentage, all Elections shall be honored as submitted and all Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the Cash Consideration until the Maximum Cash Percentage is reached and thereafter into Fulton Stock Consideration. 

   

 (iii) If the percentage of Outstanding Shares for which a Cash Election is made (including the cash portion of any Cash/Stock Elections) exceeds the Maximum Cash Percentage: Each Columbia Share for which the holder made a Stock Election, the portion of each Cash/Stock Election electing Fulton Stock Consideration (collectively, the "Aggregate Stock Elections") and each Non-Electing Share shall be converted in the Merger into the Fulton Stock Consideration. Each Columbia Share for which a Cash Election has been received and the portion of a Cash/Stock Election electing Cash Consideration (collectively, the "Aggregate Cash Elections") shall be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and Fulton Stock Consideration in the following manner: 

   

 (A) Each Columbia stockholder shall have the Pro-rated Cash Percentage of the Columbia Shares for which he or she elected Cash Consideration (including the cash portion of any Cash/Stock Election) converted into the Cash Consideration; 

   ##### 

   

   

 (B) Each Columbia stockholder shall have the Remaining Stock Percentage of the Columbia Shares for which he or she elected Cash Consideration (including the portion of any Cash/Stock Election electing Cash Consideration) converted into the Fulton Stock Consideration; and 

   

 (C) For the purposes of the foregoing: 

   

"Aggregate Cash Election Percentage" shall mean the percentage of Outstanding
Shares represented by the Aggregate Cash Elections. 

   

"Pro-rated Cash Percentage" shall mean the percentage determined by the
following formula: 

   

1  ( _Aggregate Cash Election Percentage  50%)/Aggregate Cash Election
Percentage_ 

   

"Remaining Stock Percentage" shall mean the percentage determined
by subtracting the Pro-rated Cash Percentage from 100%. 

   

 (iv) If the percentage of Outstanding Shares for which a Cash Election is made (including the cash portion of any Cash/Stock Elections) is less than the Minimum Cash Percentage: Each Columbia Share for which the Aggregate Cash Elections have been made and each Non-Electing Share shall be converted in the Merger into the Cash Consideration. Each Columbia Share for which the Aggregate Stock Elections have been made shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and Fulton Stock Consideration in the following manner: 

   

 (A) Each Columbia Stockholder shall have the Pro-rated Stock Percentage of the Columbia Shares for which he or she elected Fulton Stock Election converted into the Fulton Stock Consideration; 

   

 (B) Each Columbia Stockholder shall have the Remaining Cash Percentage of the Columbia Shares for which he or she elected Fulton Stock Consideration (including the portion of any Cash/Stock Election electing Fulton Stock Consideration) converted into the Cash Consideration; and 

   

 (C) For the purposes of the foregoing: 

   

"Aggregate Stock Election Percentage" shall mean the percentage
of Outstanding Shares represented by the Aggregate Stock Elections. 

   

"Pro-rated Stock Percentage" shall mean the percentage determined by the
following formula: 

   ##### 

  

   

 1  ( _Aggregate Stock Election Percentage  80%)/Aggregate Stock Election Percentage_ 

   

"Remaining Cash Percentage" shall mean the percentage determined
by subtracting the Pro-rated Stock Percentage from 100%. 

   

 (v) If Non-Electing Shares are not converted under Sections (i)  (iv) above, the Exchange Agent shall convert each Non-Electing Share into the Cash Consideration. 

   

 (vi) For the purposes of this Section 2.2, Outstanding Shares as to which an Election is not in effect at the Election Deadline shall be called "Non-Electing Shares." If Fulton shall determine that any Election is not properly made with respect to any Columbia Shares, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the Columbia Shares covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares. Fulton, Columbia and the Exchange Agent shall have no obligation to notify any person of any defect in any Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (vii) The Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by this Section 2.2 and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of Columbia Shares absent manifest error. 

   

 (c) _Issuance of Fulton Stock Consideration_. 

   

 (i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Fulton shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Columbia Shares, certificates representing an aggregate number of shares of Fulton Common Stock as nearly as practicable equal to the number of shares to be converted into Fulton Common Stock as determined in Section 2.2(b) 

   

 (ii) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, each holder of Columbia Shares converted into Fulton Stock Consideration pursuant to Article II, upon proper surrender to the Exchange Agent with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal (to the extent not previously surrendered with a Form of Election ) of one or more certificates for such Columbia Shares for cancellation, shall be entitled to receive (and the Exchange Agent shall deliver) certificates representing the number of shares of Fulton Common Stock into which such Columbia Shares shall have been converted in the Merger. 

   

 (iii) No dividends or distributions that have been declared, if any, will be paid to persons entitled to receive certificates for shares of Fulton Common Stock until such persons surrender their certificates for Columbia Shares, at which time all such dividends and distributions shall be paid. In no event shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends be entitled to receive interest on such dividends. If any certificate for such Fulton Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the 

   ##### 

  

   

certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer taxes or other taxes required by reason of
issuance in a name other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to
a holder of Columbia Shares for any Fulton Common Stock or dividends thereon
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. 

   

 (d) _Payment of Cash Consideration_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Fulton shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Columbia Shares, an amount in cash equal to the Cash Consideration to be paid to holders of Columbia Shares to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration as determined in Section 2.2(b). As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall distribute to holders of Columbia Shares converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and determined in accordance with Section 2.2(b), upon proper surrender to the Exchange Agent (to the extent not previously surrendered with a Form of Election) of one or more certificates for such Columbia Shares for cancellation, a bank check for an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of Columbia Shares to converted. In no event shall the holder of any such surrendered certificates be entitled to receive interest on any of the Cash Consideration to be received in the Merger. If such check is to be issued in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the certificates surrendered for exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition of the exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of issuance of such check to a person other than the registered holder of the certificates surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Columbia Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (e) _Letter of Transmittal_. Fulton will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Columbia Shares who has not previously surrendered such holders certificates with a validly executed Form of Election as soon as reasonably practical after the Effective Time, (i) a Letter of Transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such holders certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as shall be agreed upon by Columbia prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (the "Letter of Transmittal"). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) _Missing Certificates_. 

   

 (i) If any holder of Columbia Shares convertible into the right to receive the Merger Consideration is unable to deliver the certificates which represent such shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to such holder the Merger Consideration to which the holder is entitled for such shares upon presentation of the following: 

   

 (A) evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of Fulton that any such certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed; 

   

 (B) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably requested by Fulton in accordance with industry standards to indemnify and hold harmless Fulton and the Exchange Agent; and 

   

 (C) evidence satisfactory to Fulton that such person is the owner of the shares theretofore represented by each certificate claimed to be lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that the holder is the person who would be entitled to present such certificate for payment pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) Fulton shall receive any remaining Cash Consideration and Fulton Stock Consideration on deposit with the Exchange Agent on the date which is one year after the Effective Date, and any stockholder of Columbia who has not surrendered his certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent prior to such time shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration without interest upon the surrender of such certificate(s) to Fulton, subject to applicable escheat or abandoned property laws. 

   

 (iii) In the event that any certificates for Columbia Shares have not been surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section on or before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Fulton may at any time thereafter, with or without notice to the holders of record of such certificates, sell for the accounts of any or all of such holders any or all of the shares of Fulton Common Stock which such holders are entitled to receive under Article II hereof (the "Unclaimed Shares"). Any such sale may be made by public or private sale or sale at any brokers board or on any securities exchange in such manner and at such times as Fulton shall determine. If, in the opinion of counsel for Fulton, it is necessary or desirable, any Unclaimed Shares may be registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and applicable state laws. Fulton shall not be obligated to make any sale of Unclaimed Shares if it shall determine not to do so, even if notice of the sale of the Unclaimed Shares has been given. The net proceeds of any such sale of Unclaimed Shares shall be held for holders of the unsurrendered certificates for Columbia Shares whose Unclaimed Shares have been sold, to be paid to them upon surrender of the certificates for shares of Fulton Common Stock. From and after any such sale, the sole right of the holders of the unsurrendered certificates for Columbia Shares whose Unclaimed Shares have been sold shall be the right to collect the net sale proceeds held by Fulton for their respective accounts, and such holders shall not be entitled to receive any interest on such net sale proceeds held 

   ##### 

  

   

by Fulton. If outstanding certificates are not surrendered or the payment for
them is not claimed prior to the date on which such payments would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the
unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property laws,
escheat laws and any other applicable law, become the property of Fulton (and
to the extent not in its possession shall be paid over to it), free and clear
of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such claims.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Fulton, Columbia, the Exchange Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Columbia Shares
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Fulton shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from funds provided by the holder or from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Columbia Shares, the minimum amounts (if any) that Fulton is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Fulton, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Columbia Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Fulton. 

   

 (h) _Expenses_. All costs and expenses associated with the foregoing surrender and exchange procedure shall be borne by Fulton. 

  

 Section 2.3 Treatment of Outstanding Columbia Options. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option (collectively, "Columbia Options") to purchase shares of Columbia Common Stock that (i) is outstanding at the Effective Time, (ii) has been granted pursuant to Columbias 1987 Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1990 Director Stock Option Plan, as amended and 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended (collectively, the "Columbia Stock Option Plans"); and (iii) would otherwise survive the Effective Time, in the absence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall, at the election of the holder of a Columbia Option made on or before the Election Deadline, either (A) be entitled to cash in an amount equal to the number of shares of Columbia Common Stock covered by such Columbia Option multiplied by the excess, if any, of $42.48 over the exercise price per share of such Columbia Option or (B) be assumed by Fulton through the grant of an option to acquire shares of Fulton Common Stock on the terms set forth below (each Columbia Option, as assumed, a "Fulton Stock Option"). In the absence of an election by the holder of a Columbia Option and subject to the next sentence, Columbia Options held by such holder shall be converted to cash . 

   

 (b) A Fulton Stock Option shall be a stock option to acquire shares of Fulton Common Stock with the following terms: (i) the number of shares of Fulton Common Stock which may be acquired pursuant to such Fulton Stock Option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Columbia Common Stock covered by the Columbia 

   ##### 

  

   

Option multiplied by the Conversion Ratio, provided that any fractional share
of Fulton Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole share; (ii) the exercise price per share of Fulton
Common Stock shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Columbia
Common Stock of such Columbia Option, divided by the Conversion Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent; (iii) the duration and other terms of such Fulton Stock Option shall be
identical to the duration and other terms of such Columbia Option (giving
effect to the terms of the Columbia Stock Option Plans or the Columbia
Options providing for accelerated vesting as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) except that all references to
Columbia shall be deemed to be references to Fulton and its affiliates, where
the context so requires, and shall remain exercisable until the stated
expiration date of the corresponding Columbia Option; (iv) Fulton shall
assume such Columbia Option, whether vested or not vested, as contemplated
by Section 424(a) of the Code; and (v) to the extent Columbia Options
qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code, the Fulton
Stock Options exchanged therefor shall also so qualify. In connection with
the foregoing, (i) the foregoing is intended to effect an assumption of a
Columbia Option by Fulton under Section 424(a) of the Code and (ii) neither a
Fulton Option nor the assumption of a Columbia Option shall give the holder
of a Columbia Option additional benefits which he did not have under such
Columbia Option within the meaning of Section 424(a)(1) of the Code. Subject
to the Fulton Stock Options and the foregoing, the Columbia Stock Option Plans
and all options or other rights to acquire Columbia Common Stock issued
thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time. Fulton shall not issue or
pay for any fractional shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of a Fulton
Stock Option. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Fulton shall take appropriate action to reserve for issuance and, if not previously registered pursuant to the 1933 Act, register the number of shares of Fulton Common Stock necessary to satisfy Fultons obligations with respect to the issuance of Fulton Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of Fulton Stock Options and under Section 2.3. 

   

 (d) On or before the Election Deadline (to the extent required as determined by Fulton or Columbia under applicable law, the terms of the Columbia Stock Option Plans or otherwise), Fulton shall receive agreements from each holder of a Columbia Option that does not elect to exercise such Columbia Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and have the Columbia Common Stock acquired as a result of such exercise converted into cash or Fulton Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Agreement, pursuant to which each such holder agrees to accept cash or a Fulton Stock Option in substitution for the Columbia Option, as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) _Schedule 2.3_ sets forth a listing of each Columbia Option as of the date of this Agreement (copies of which have been provided to Fulton), including the name of each holder of such Columbia Option, the date of grant, the number of shares of Columbia Common Stock subject to such Columbia Option, the exercise price per share 

   ##### 

  

   

of such Columbia Option, the expiration date, and the classification of
whether such Columbia Option is an incentive stock option or a nonqualified
stock option. 

  

 Section 2.4 Reservation of Shares. Fulton agrees that (i) prior to the Effective Time, it will take appropriate action to reserve a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares of Fulton Common Stock to be issued in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) at the Effective Time, Fulton will issue shares of Fulton Common Stock to the extent set forth in, and in accordance with, this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.5 Taking Necessary Action. Fulton and Columbia shall take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby including, without limitation, providing information necessary for preparation of any filings needed to obtain the regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Fulton with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of Columbia, the officers and directors of Columbia, at the expense of Fulton, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such necessary action. 

  

 Section 2.6 Press Releases, Etc. Fulton and Columbia agree that all press releases or other public communications relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will require mutual approval by Fulton and Columbia, unless counsel has advised any such party that such release or other public communication must immediately be issued and the issuing party has not been able, despite its good faith efforts, to obtain such approval. 

  

 Section 2.7 Fulton Common Stock. Each share of Fulton Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall, on and after the Effective Time, remain issued and outstanding as one (1) share of Fulton Common Stock, and each holder thereof shall retain his rights therein. The holders of the shares of Fulton Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, immediately after the Effective Time, continue to hold a majority of the outstanding shares of Fulton Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.8 Dissenters Rights. Pursuant to Section 3-202(c) of the GCL, the stockholders of Columbia shall not be entitled to exercise dissenters rights. 

  

 Section 2.9 Certain Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, Fulton and Columbia shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of shares of Columbia Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article II of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), with respect to Columbia to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.

Each of the foregoing financial statements fairly present the consolidated financial position, and results of operations and cash flows of Columbia at their respective dates and for the respective periods then ended and has been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP"), except as otherwise noted in a footnote thereto and except for (i) the omission of the notes from the financial statements applicable to any interim period and (ii) with respect to any interim period, normal year-end adjustments. 

   

 (b) Except (A) as reflected in Columbias unaudited balance sheet at March 31, 2005 or liabilities described in any notes thereto (or liabilities for which neither accrual nor footnote disclosure is required pursuant to GAAP) or (B) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2005 consistent with past practices or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, neither Columbia nor any of its subsidiaries has any material liabilities or obligations of any nature. The Columbia SEC Reports describe and Columbia has delivered to Fulton copies of the documentation creating or governing, all securitization transactions and "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) effected by Columbia or its subsidiaries since KPMG LLP expressed its opinion with respect to the financial statements of Columbia and its subsidiaries included in the Columbia SEC Reports (including the related notes). 

   

 (c) KPMG LLP is and has been (x) since September 24, 2003, a registered public accounting firm (as defined in Section 2(a)(12) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "SOX Act")), (y) throughout the periods covered by such financial statements, "independent" with respect to Columbia within the meaning of Regulation S-X, and (z) since May 6, 2003, in compliance with subsections (g) through (l) of Section 10A of the 1934 Act and the related Rules of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Columbia SEC Reports describe the types of non-audit services performed by KPMG LLP for Columbia and its subsidiaries since January 1, 2002, other than non-audit services performed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Each of Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries maintains accurate books and records reflecting its assets and liabilities and maintains proper and adequate internal 

   ##### 

  

   

accounting controls which provide assurance that (i) transactions are
executed with managements authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements of
Columbia and to maintain accountability for Columbias consolidated assets;
(iii) access to Columbias assets is permitted only in accordance
with managements authorization; (iv) the reporting of Columbias assets is
compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. 

   

 (e) Columbia has, on a timely basis, filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2002. Except to the extent available in full without redaction on the SECs website through the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), Columbia has delivered to Fulton copies in the form filed with the SEC of (i) Columbias Annual Reports on Form 10-K for each fiscal year of Columbia from and after January 1, 2002, (ii) its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the first three fiscal quarters in each of the fiscal years of Columbia referred to in clause (i) above, (iii) all proxy statements relating to Columbias meetings of stockholders (whether annual or special) held, and all information statements relating to stockholder consents since the beginning of the first fiscal year referred to in clause (i) above, (iv) all certifications and statements required by (x) the SECs Order dated June 27, 2002 pursuant to Section 21(a)(1) of the 1934 Act (File No. 4-460), (y) 18 U.S.C. §1350 (Section 906 of the SOX Act) with respect to any report referred to in clause (i) or (iii) above, (y) all other forms, reports, registration statements and other documents (other than preliminary materials if the corresponding definitive materials have been provided to Fulton pursuant to this Section 3.6) filed by Columbia with the SEC since the beginning of the first fiscal year referred to in clause (i) above (the forms, reports, registration statements and other documents referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) above are, collectively, the "Columbia SEC Reports" and, to the extent available in full without redaction on the SECs website through EDGAR two days prior to the date of this Agreement, are, collectively, the "Filed Columbia SEC Reports"), and (vi) all comment letters received by Columbia from the Staff of the SEC since January 1, 2002 and all responses to such comment letters by or on behalf of Columbia. The Columbia SEC Reports (x) were prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder and (y) did not at the time they were filed with the SEC, or will not at the time they are filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of Columbia is or has been required to file any form, report, registration statement or other document with the SEC. 

   

 (f) Columbia maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the 1934 Act; such controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information concerning Columbia and its subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Columbias filings with 

   ##### 

  

   

the SEC and other public disclosure documents. _Schedule 3.6_ lists, and
Columbia has delivered to Fulton copies of, all written descriptions of, and
all policies, manuals and other documents promulgating, such disclosure
controls and procedures. To Columbias knowledge, except as set forth in the
Columbia SEC Reports, each director and executive officer of Columbia has
filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements required by Section 16(a)
of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder since January
1, 2002. As used in this Section 3.6, the term "file" shall be broadly
construed to include any manner in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC. To the extent
required, Columbia and The Columbia Bank have in place "disclosure controls
and procedures" as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the 1934 Act
to allow Columbias management to make timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Columbia required under the 1934
Act. Since March 31, 2005, there has not been any material change in the
internal controls utilized by Columbia to assure that its consolidated
financial statements conform with GAAP. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Columbias disclosure controls and procedures are designed and
maintained to ensure that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization, (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences, (v) all information
(both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Columbia in
the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and (vi) all such information is accumulated and
communicated to Columbias management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Columbia
required under the 1934 Act with respect to such reports. None of Columbias
or any Columbia Subsidiarys records, systems, controls, data or information
are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly
dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic, mechanical
or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of the Columbia or the Columbia Subsidiaries or their
independent accountants. 

   

 (g) Each of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Columbia has signed, and Columbia has furnished to the SEC, all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the SOX Act; such certifications contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not been modified or withdrawn; and neither Columbia nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such certifications. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (h) Columbia heretofore has provided to Fulton complete and correct copies of all certifications filed with the SEC pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the SOX Act and to the Knowledge of Columbia, the matters and statements made in such certificates were true as of the date thereof. 

  

 Section 3.7 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.7_, or as reflected, noted or adequately reserved against in the Columbia Balance Sheet, at March 31, 2005, Columbia had no material liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which were required to be reflected, noted or reserved against in the Columbia Balance Sheet under GAAP. Except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.7_, Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries have not incurred, since March 31, 2005, any such liability, other than liabilities of the same nature as those set forth in the Columbia Balance Sheet, all of which have been incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Ordinary Course of Business" shall mean the ordinary course of business consistent with Columbias and the Columbia Subsidiaries customary business practices.

   #####

Code or Section 406 of ERISA) and not otherwise exempt under ERISA or the

In the event the Board of Directors of Columbia takes any of the actions set forth in clauses (1), (2) and/or (3) of Section 5.7(c) without compliance with the standards therein, such action shall constitute a breach allowing termination of this Agreement by Fulton under Section 8.1(b)(iii) herein which shall be treated in the same manner as termination by Fulton under Section 8.1(b)(i) herein and shall allow exercise of the Warrant. 

   

 (ii) This Agreement may be terminated by Columbia prior to the stockholders meeting of Columbia if (A) the Board of Directors of Columbia shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with their responsibilities under Maryland law, (B) it is not in breach of its obligations under this Section 5.7 in any material respect and has complied with, and continues to comply with, all requirements and procedures of this Section 5.7 in all material respects and the Board of Directors of Columbia has authorized, subject to complying with the terms of this Agreement, Columbia to enter into a binding written agreement for a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and Columbia notifies Fulton in writing that it intends to enter into such agreement, attaching the most current version of such agreement to such notice; (C) Fulton does not make, within five (5) business days after receipt of Columbias written notice of its intention to enter into a binding agreement for a Superior Proposal, any offer that the Board of Directors of Columbia reasonably and in good faith determines, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of Columbia as the Superior Proposal and during such period Columbia reasonably considers and discusses in good faith all proposals submitted by Fulton and, without limiting the foregoing, meets with, and causes its financial and legal advisors to meet with, Fulton and its advisors from time to time as required by Fulton to consider and discuss in good faith Fultons proposals, and (D) prior to Columbias termination pursuant to this Section 5.7(e)(ii), Columbia confirms in writing that such termination allows exercise of the Warrant. Columbia agrees (x) that it will not enter into a binding agreement referred to in clause (B) above until at least the five (5) business days after Fulton has received the notice to Fulton 

   ##### 

  

    

required by clause (C) and (y) to notify Fulton promptly if its intention
to enter into a binding agreement referred to in its notice to Fulton shall
change at any time after giving such notice.

 (i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean a written proposal or written offer (other than by another party hereto) for a tender or exchange offer for securities of Columbia or any of the Columbia Subsidiaries, or a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving an acquisition of Columbia or any of the Columbia Subsidiaries or any proposal to acquire in any manner a substantial equity interest in or a substantial portion of the assets of Columbia or any of the Columbia Subsidiaries. 

   

 (ii) A "Superior Proposal" shall be an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Columbia believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the source of its financing, on the terms proposed and, believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor), would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the stockholders of Columbia from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that the person making such Acquisition Proposal has, or is reasonably likely to have or obtain, any necessary funds or customary commitments to provide any funds necessary to consummate such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 Section 5.8 Affiliate Letters. Columbia shall use its best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Fulton, at or before the Closing, a letter from each of the executive officers and directors of Columbia and shall use its best efforts to obtain and deliver such a letter from each stockholder of Columbia who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (as that term is defined for purposes of Rules 145 and 405 promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act) of Columbia, in form and substance satisfactory to Fulton and Columbia, under the terms of which each such officer, director or stockholder acknowledges and agrees to abide by all limitations imposed by the 1933 Act and by all rules, regulations and releases promulgated thereunder by the SEC with respect to the sale or other disposition of the shares of Fulton Common Stock to be received by such person pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.9 No Purchases or Sales of Fulton Common Stock During Price Determination Period.

   ##### 

  

    

purchase shares of Columbia Common Stock in the ordinary course of business
during the Price Determination Period for the benefit of Columbias
Benefit Plans or Columbias Dividend Reinvestment Plan. 

  

 Section 5.10 Dividends. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Date, Columbia shall not declare or pay cash dividends on the Columbia Common Stock; provided, however, that (a) Columbia may declare and pay a quarterly dividend of up to $0.17 per share on the Columbia Common Stock on each of (i) July 28, 2005; and (ii) October 28, 2005, provided that the Effective Date does not occur (or is not expected to occur) on or before the record date for the dividend on Fulton Common Stock scheduled to be paid on or about October 14, 2005; and (b) Columbia may declare and pay a quarterly dividend of up to $0.19 per share on the Columbia Common Stock on each of (i) January 25, 2006, provided that the Effective Date does not occur (or is not expected to occur) on or before the record date for the dividend on the Fulton Common Stock scheduled to be paid on or about January 16, 2006; (ii) April 14, 2006, provided that the Effective Date does not occur (or is not expected to occur) on or before the record date for the dividend on the Fulton Common Stock scheduled to be paid on or about April 14, 2006 and (iii) July 28, 2006, provided that the Effective Date does not occur (or is not expected to occur) on or before the record date for the dividend on the Fulton Common Stock scheduled to be paid on or about July 14, 2006 (it being the intent of Fulton and Columbia that Columbia be permitted to pay a dividend on the Columbia Common Stock on the dates indicated in subsections (a)(ii), (b)(i), (ii) and (iii) above only if the stockholders of Columbia, upon becoming shareholders of Fulton, would not be entitled to receive a dividend on the Fulton Common Stock on the payment dates indicated in such subsections. 

  

 Section 5.11 Internal Controls. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Columbia shall permit Fulton senior officers to meet with the Chief Financial Officer of Columbia and other officers responsible for the Columbia Financial Statements, the internal controls of Columbia and the disclosure controls and procedures of Columbia to discuss such matters as Fulton may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for Fulton to satisfy its obligations under Sections 302, 404 and 906 of the SOX Act and any rules and regulations relating thereto.

 Notwithstanding that Columbia believes that it and the Columbia Subsidiaries have established all reserves and taken all provisions for possible loan losses required by GAAP and applicable laws, rules and regulations, Columbia recognizes that Fulton may have adopted different loan, accrual and reserve policies (including loan classifications and levels of reserves for possible loan losses). At or before the Effective Time, upon the request of Fulton and Fultons written confirmation that all conditions precedent under Article VII (other than the delivery of customary closing documents) have been satisfied or waived, and in order to 

   ##### 

  

    

formulate the plan of integration for the Merger, Columbia shall, consistent
with GAAP, modify and change its loan, litigation and real estate valuation
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels
of reserves) so as to be applied consistently on a mutually satisfactory
basis with those of Fulton and establish such accruals and reserves as shall
be necessary to reflect Merger-related expenses and costs incurred by
Columbia and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that Columbia shall not
be required to take such action prior to receipt of stockholder and
regulatory approvals; and provided further, however, that no accrual or
reserve made by Columbia or any Columbia Subsidiary pursuant to this Section
5.12 or any litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out of any such
accrual or reserve, shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation
of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or
other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining
whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall
have occurred. 

  

 Section 5.13 Other Policies. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Columbia shall cooperate with Fulton to reasonably conform the policies and procedures of Columbia and its Subsidiaries regarding applicable regulatory matters to those of Fulton and the Fulton Subsidiaries, as Fulton may reasonably identify to Columbia from time to time, provided, however, that implementation of such conforming actions may at Columbias discretion be delayed until the time period following satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.12. 

  

 Section 5.14 Other Transactions. Columbia acknowledges that Fulton may be in the process of acquiring other banks and financial institutions or in offering securities to the public and that in connection with such transactions, information concerning Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries may be required to be included in the registration statements, if any, for the sale of securities of Fulton or in SEC reports in connection with such transactions. Fulton shall provide Columbia and its counsel with copies of such registration statements at the time of filing. Columbia agrees to provide Fulton with any information, certificates, documents or other materials about Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries as are reasonably necessary to be included in such SEC reports or registration statements, including registration statements which may be filed by Fulton prior to the Effective Time.

Fulton may rely upon all information provided to it by Columbia and The Columbia Bank in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Fulton shall not be liable for any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact in the Registration Statement, or in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, if such statement is made by Fulton in reliance upon any information provided to Fulton by Columbia or the Columbia Subsidiaries or by any of their officers, agents or representatives. Fulton shall provide a draft of the Registration Statement to Columbia and its counsel for comment and review at least ten (10) business days in advance of the anticipated filing date. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) _State Securities Laws_.

 (e) _Adopt Amendments_. Fulton shall not adopt any amendments to its charter or bylaws or other organizational documents that would alter the terms of Fultons Common Stock or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Fulton to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 (f) _Tax Treatment_. Fulton shall take no action which would have the effect of causing the Merger not to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. 

  

 Section 6.2 Access to Properties and Records. Fulton shall give to Columbia and to its authorized employees and representatives (including without limitation Columbias counsel, accountants, economic and environmental consultants and other designated representatives) such access during normal business hours to all properties, books, contracts, documents and records of Fulton as Columbia may reasonably request, subject to the obligation of Columbia and its authorized employees and representatives to maintain the confidentiality of all nonpublic information concerning Fulton obtained by reason of such access and subject to applicable law.

    ##### 

 

    

 Section 6.6 No Purchase or Sales of Fulton Common Stock During Price Determination Period Neither Fulton nor any Fulton Subsidiary, nor any executive officer or director of Fulton or any Fulton Subsidiary, nor any shareholder of Fulton who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (as that term is defined for purposes of Rules 145 and 405 promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act) of Fulton, shall purchase or sell on NASDAQ, or submit a bid to purchase or an offer to sell on NASDAQ, directly or indirectly, any shares of Fulton Common Stock or Columbia Common Stock or any options, rights or other securities convertible into shares of Fulton Common Stock or Columbia Common Stock during the Price Determination Period; provided, however, that Fulton may purchase shares of Fulton Common Stock in the Ordinary Course of Business of Fulton during the Price Determination Period for the benefit of Fultons Benefit Plans or Fultons Dividend Reinvestment Plan. 

  

 Section 6.7 Assumption of Columbia Trust Preferred Securities. Fulton agrees that, effective with the Effective Date, it shall assume the Columbia Trust Preferred Securities, and all of Columbias obligations under the related Indentures, and shall take all actions necessary or appropriate in accordance therewith, including, if requested by the trustee, execution of a supplemental indenture and other appropriate documents or certificates. 

  

 Section 6.8 Employment Arrangements. 

   

 (a) In arriving at the Merger Consideration, Fulton anticipated that there will be some consolidation of The Columbia Banks "back room" operations. Subject to that caveat, from and after the Effective Time, (i) Fulton, The Columbia Bank or another subsidiary of Fulton (any such parties employing employees of Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary, the "Fulton Employers") shall: (A) satisfy each of the Employment Obligations, and (B) use its good faith efforts to retain each present employee of Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries in such employees current position and salary compensation (or, if offered to, and accepted by, an employee, a position for which the employee is qualified with the Fulton Employers at a compensation commensurate with the position), (ii) in the event that the Fulton Employers shall continue to employ officers or employees of Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, the Fulton Employers shall employ such persons on the Effective Time who are not Contract Employees as "at-will" employees, and (iii) in the event the Fulton Employers are not willing to employ, or terminate the employment (other than as a result of unsatisfactory performance of their respective duties) of, any officers or employees of Columbia or the Columbia Subsidiaries who are not Contract Employees, the Fulton Employers shall pay severance benefits to such employees (other than Contract Employees) as follows: (A) in the event employment is terminated on or prior to the date which is one year after the Effective Date, one weeks salary plus one weeks salary for each year of service with Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary, or predecessor of Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary if such service was recognized by Columbia for the purposes of Columbias 401(k) Plan, up to a maximum of 26 weeks salary; (B) in the event employment is terminated thereafter, in accordance with the then existing severance policy of Fulton or its successor; or (C) as otherwise agreed between Fulton and Columbia. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) The Fulton Employers shall be obligated to provide employee benefits to each person who is an employee of Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Time and continues to be employed that are substantially equivalent, in the aggregate, to the benefits under the Columbia Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time, until at least three (3) years after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if the Fulton Employers can no longer satisfy the applicable employee benefit plan testing requirements under the Code after applicable transition periods under the Code with respect to a Fulton Benefit Plan then the Fulton Employers shall provide appropriately adjusted benefits to each person who is an employee of Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary that would permit such Fulton Benefit Plan to satisfy the applicable test under the Code. 

   

 (c) For at least the required three-year period, the Fulton Employers shall adopt or maintain a Fulton Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) plan for the benefit of each person who is an employee of Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary, as of the Effective Time, and who is eligible to participate in the Columbia Bancorp 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Date. Such Fulton Benefit Plan shall provide either (i) a matching contribution equal to 50% of each participants salary deferral contributions made under such 401(k) plan, with the matching contribution applicable only to salary deferral contributions up to 15% covered compensation or (ii) such other employer contribution amounts as proposed by Fulton and agreed upon by Columbia on or before the Effective Date. 

   

 (d) For at least the required three-year period, the Fulton Employers shall adopt or maintain a Fulton Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of each person who is an employee of Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary, as of the Effective Time, and who is eligible, as of the date hereof, to participate in any Columbia Bank deferred compensation plans as in effect on the date hereof. Such Fulton Benefit Plan shall provide either (i) a matching contribution equal to 50% of each participants salary deferral contributions made under such deferred compensation plan, with the matching contribution applicable only to salary deferral contributions up to 15% of covered compensation or (ii) such other employer contribution amounts as proposed by Fulton and agreed upon by Columbia on or before the Effective Date. Such Fulton Benefit Plan shall also provide for benefits and other provisions consistent with the existing deferred compensation plans, including continuation of the accrual of earnings (but with only the prime rate election available) and the continuation of the death benefit provisions beyond the required three-year period, until the applicable employee consents to an amendment thereto. 

   

 (e) For vesting and eligibility purposes for employee benefits, under each Fulton Benefit Plan and/or any employee benefit plan established by Fulton after the Effective Date, employees of Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries shall receive credit for all years of service with Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries or predecessor of Columbia or the Columbia Subsidiaries if such service was recognized by Columbia for purposes of a comparable Columbia Benefit Plan. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) Except to the extent not allowable under the terms of existing insurance contracts, any restrictions on coverage for preexisting conditions or requirements for evidence of insurability under a Fulton Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan shall be waived for the employees of Columbia and the Columbia Subsidiaries who are currently covered for such conditions under Columbias existing insurance plans, and such employees shall receive credit under the applicable Fulton Benefit Plan for co-payments and payments under a deductible limit made by them and for out-of-pocket maximums applicable to them during the plan year of the Columbia Benefit Plan in accordance with the corresponding Columbia Benefit Plan. If the terms of an existing insurance contract do not permit a waiver of restrictions or credit for co-payments and payments as described in the preceding sentence, Fulton agrees to use its best efforts to negotiate such provisions with the applicable insurer and, if Fulton is unable to obtain such provision, Fulton shall provide reasonable compensation to such employee in respect thereof. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, reasonable compensation shall be deemed to be annual compensation in the amount of the premium contribution which Fulton makes under any such insurance policy on behalf of other employees with similar age and years of service. 

  

 Section 6.9 Insurance; Indemnification. 

   

 (a) For six (6) years after the Effective Date, Fulton shall (and The Columbia Bank shall cooperate in these efforts) obtain and maintain "tail" coverage relating to Columbias existing directors and officers liability insurance policy (provided that such insurance shall be in such amount and with terms and conditions no less favorable than the director and officer liability policy of Columbia as of the date of this Agreement and carry such premium (not to exceed the greater of (i) 150% of the current premium for Columbias existing directors and officers liability insurance policy or (ii) the applicable percentage increase payable by Fulton during such period for its directors and officers liability insurance policy) and that Fulton may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from facts or circumstances which occur prior to the Effective Date (including facts or circumstances relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein to the extent coverage therefor is available) and covering persons who are covered by such insurance immediately prior to the Effective Date. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Date, Fulton shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Date, an officer, employee, director or manager of Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of Fulton, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a "Claim") in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or a witness based in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of 

   ##### 

  

   

Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact
arising, existing or occurring prior to the Effective Date (including,
without limitation, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to,
at, or after the Effective Date (the "Indemnified Liabilities") to the full
extent permitted under applicable law as of the date hereof or amended prior
to the Effective Date and under the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
of Columbia or a Columbia Subsidiary as in effect as of the date hereof (and
Fulton shall pay expenses in advance of the full disposition of any such
action or proceeding to each of the Indemnified Parties to the full extent
permitted by applicable law (including the SOX Act) and Fultons Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws). Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this provision, upon learning of any Claim, shall
notify Fulton (but the failure to so notify Fulton shall not relieve Fulton
from any liability which Fulton may have under this section except to the
extent Fulton is materially prejudiced thereby). In the defense of any Claim
covered by this Section 6.9(b), Fulton shall have the right to direct the
defense of such action and retain counsel of its choice; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties as a group may
retain a single law firm to represent them with respect to each matter under
this section if there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct,
a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of Fulton and the
Indemnified Parties (the Indemnified Parties may also retain more than one
law firm if there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct,
a conflict of any significant issues between the positions of two or more
Indemnified Parties). Fulton shall have an obligation to advance funds to
satisfy an obligation of Fulton or any successor to Fulton under this Section
6.9(b) to the same extent that Fulton would be obligated to advance funds
under the indemnification provisions of its Articles of Incorporation and/or
Bylaws. 

  

 Section 6.10 Appointment of Fulton Director. Fulton shall, on or promptly after the Effective Date (but no later than Fultons next Board of Directors meeting following the Effective Date), appoint to Fultons Board of Directors John M. Bond, Jr. to serve as a director of Fulton or, subject to the reasonable approval of Fulton, such other person as may be determined by vote of Columbias Board of Directors prior to the Effective Date. Fulton has a mandatory retirement policy for directors who attain age 70. 

  

 Section 6.11 Continuation of The Columbia Banks Structure, Name and Directors. 

    

 (a) For a period of three (3) years after the Effective Date, Fulton shall (subject to the right of Fulton and The Columbia Bank Continuing Directors (as defined below) to terminate such obligations under this Section 6.11(a) under subsections (b) and (c) below) (i) preserve the business structure of The Columbia Bank as a Maryland trust company; (ii) preserve and use the present name of The Columbia Bank, and (iii) continue in office the present directors of The Columbia Bank who indicate their desire to serve (the "Columbia Bank Continuing Directors"), provided, that (A) prior to the Effective Time and for the three-year period following the Effective Time, each non-employee Columbia Bank Continuing Director shall continue to receive directors fees as 

   ##### 

  

   

set forth on _Schedule 6.11_; provided that, in the event an individual
Columbia Bank Continuing Director ceases to act as a director or as a member
of any committee thereof, the foregoing obligation to pay such fees shall
apply to successors in such positions until the expiration of such three-year
period and (B) after such three-year period, each Columbia Bank Continuing
Director shall be subject to Fultons mandatory retirement rules for
directors and shall receive the standard fee paid to directors of comparable
subsidiary banks of Fulton. 

   

 (b) Fulton shall have the right to terminate its obligations under subsection (a) of this Section 6.11 as a result of (i) regulatory requirements, (ii) safe and sound banking practices as enunciated by bank regulatory agencies, or (iii) based upon the advice of outside legal counsel the exercise of their fiduciary duties by Fultons directors. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, The Columbia Bank Continuing Directors, in their exercise of their fiduciary duty as to the best interests of The Columbia Bank and Fulton, may, by a majority vote of such directors, modify or waive any or all of the foregoing provisions in subsection (a) of this Section 6.11.

Fulton, including reasonable expenses incurred by Fulton in consummating the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, (e) changes in the relative
percentages of Fultons net income generated by Fultons commercial
lending activities and residential mortgage lending activities, (f) national
or international political or social conditions, including without limitation

to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence of any
military or terrorist attack upon the United States, or any of its
territories, possessions or diplomatic or consular offices or upon any
military installation, equipment or personnel of the United States, (g)
changes in financial, banking or securities markets (including any disruption
thereof and any decline in the price of any security or market index), and
(h) any existing fact, event, occurrence, or circumstance with respect to
which Columbia has Knowledge as of the date hereof. At the Closing,
Fulton shall deliver to Columbia a certificate confirming the absence of a
material adverse change described herein and a certificate (from appropriate
officers of Fulton and/or Fultons transfer agent) as to the issued and
outstanding shares of Fulton Common Stock, shares of Fulton Common Stock
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, under
Fultons Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under Fultons Dividend Reinvestment
Plan and under Fultons Shareholders Rights Plan, any outstanding
obligations, options or rights of any kind entitling persons to purchase or
sell any shares of Fulton Common Stock and any outstanding securities or
other instruments of any kind that are convertible into such shares. 

   

 (f) _Fairness Opinion_ : Columbia shall have obtained from Danielson Associates Inc. or another independent financial advisor selected by the Board of Directors of Columbia, an opinion dated within five (5) days of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be furnished to the Board of Directors of Columbia stating that the Conversion Ratio and Cash Consideration contemplated by this Agreement is fair to the stockholders of Columbia from a financial point of view. 

   

 (g) _Contract Employees_. Each Contract Employee shall remain employed with Columbia or The Columbia Bank other than as a result of the death or Disability (as such term is defined in the Employment Agreements) of such Contract Employee. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (h) _Closing Documents_ : Fulton shall have delivered to Columbia: (i) a certificate signed by Fultons Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (or other officer reasonably acceptable to Columbia) verifying that, to their knowledge, all of the representations and warranties of Fulton set forth in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing and that Fulton has performed in all material respects each of the covenants required to be performed by Fulton; and (ii) such other certificates and documents as Columbia and its counsel may reasonably request (all of the foregoing certificates and documents being herein referred to as the "Fulton Closing Documents"). 

  

ARTICLE VIII  TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER 

   

 Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Effective Time (whether before or after the authorization, approval and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Columbia) as follows: 

   

 (a) _Mutual Consent_ : This Agreement may be terminated by mutual consent of the parties upon the affirmative vote of a majority of each of the Boards of Directors of Columbia and Fulton, followed by written notices given to the other party. 

   

 (b) _Unilateral Action by Fulton_ : This Agreement may be terminated unilaterally by the affirmative vote of the Board of Directors of Fulton, followed by written notice given promptly to Columbia, if: (i) there has been a material breach by Columbia of any material representation or warranty or material failure by Columbia to comply with any material covenant set forth in this Agreement and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach has been given by Fulton to Columbia; (ii) any condition precedent to Fultons obligations as set forth in Article VII of this Agreement remains unsatisfied, through no fault of Fulton or unless any such condition remains unsatisfied primarily as a result of Fulton breaching any of its representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, on June 30, 2006; provided, that such date may be extended until September 30, 2006 by Columbia by written notice to Fulton (given not later than June 30, 2006) if the Closing shall not have occurred because of failure to obtain approval from one or more regulatory authorities whose approval is required in connection with this Agreement; or (iii) Fultons Board of Directors makes an election provided for in Section 5.7(e)(i) herein. 

   

 (c) _Unilateral Action By Columbia_ : This Agreement may be terminated unilaterally by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors of Columbia, followed by written notice given promptly to Fulton, if: (i) there has been a material breach by Fulton of any material representation, or warranty or material failure by Fulton to comply with any covenant set forth in this Agreement and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach has been given by Columbia to Fulton; (ii) any condition precedent to Columbias obligations as set forth in Article VII of this Agreement remains unsatisfied, through no fault of Columbia or unless any such condition remains unsatisfied primarily as a result of Columbia breaching any of its representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, on June 30, 2006; 

   ##### 

  

   

provided, that such date may be extended until September 30, 2006 by Fulton by
written notice to Columbia (given not later than June 30, 2006) if the
Closing shall not have occurred because of failure to obtain approval from
one or more regulatory authorities whose approval is required in connection
with this Agreement; (iii) Columbias Board of Directors makes an election
provided for in, and subject to the conditions of, Section 5.7(e)(ii) herein,
(iv) the fairness opinion described in Section 7.3(f) is withdrawn; (v)
the stockholders of Columbia do not approve the Merger at a stockholders
meeting called for such purpose or (vi) based on the Closing Market Price as
follows: 

   

 (i) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) below, Columbia shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, through a resolution adopted by its Board of Directors, if the Closing Market Price is less than both (I) $14.79, i.e., eighty percent (80%) of the Starting Price (the "Floor Price") and (II) the amount per share equal to (x) the Starting Price multiplied by (y) .80 multiplied by (z) the quotient of the Average NASDAQ Bank Index for the Price Determination Period (the numerator) over the NASDAQ Bank Index on the Pre-Announcement Date (the denominator). 

   

 (ii) In the event the conditions in (A) above allowing Columbia to terminate the Agreement are satisfied and Columbia makes such election, Fulton, through a resolution adopted by its Board of Directors, shall have the option to cause Columbia to amend this Agreement (and, upon such amendment, Columbia shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement) to increase the Conversion Ratio to a level, calculated to four decimal places, equal to the Conversion Ratio multiplied by the quotient of the Floor Price (the numerator) over the Closing Market Price (the denominator). For example, if the Closing Market Price is $14.00 and the Floor Price is $14.79, Parent would have the option to increase the Exchange Ratio to 2.4562 (2.325x $14.79/$14.00) in lieu of terminating this Agreement. 

   

 (iii) For purposes of this Section 8.1(c), (I) "Pre-Announcement Date" shall mean July 26, 2005, and (II) "Starting Price" shall mean $18.49. 

   

 (iv) The Starting Price, the Closing Market Price, the Floor Price and the other amounts above shall be appropriately adjusted for an event described in the definition of "Fulton Stock Consideration" in Section 2.1(b) herein. 

  

 Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. 

   

 (a) _Effect_. In the event of a permitted termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 herein, the Agreement shall become null and void and the transactions contemplated herein shall thereupon be abandoned, except that the provisions relating to limited liability and confidentiality set forth in Sections 8.2(b) and 8.2(c) herein shall survive such termination. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) _Limited Liability_. Subject to the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Warrant, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 8.1 herein shall create no liability on the part of either party, or on the part of either partys directors, officers, stockholders, agents or representatives, except that if this Agreement is terminated by Fulton by reason of a material breach by Columbia, or if this Agreement is terminated by Columbia by reason of a material breach by Fulton, and such breach involves an intentional, willful or grossly negligent misrepresentation or breach of covenant, the breaching party (i.e., Fulton or Columbia) shall be liable to the nonbreaching party for all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the nonbreaching party in connection with the preparation, execution and attempted consummation of this Agreement, including the reasonable fees of its counsel, accountants, consultants and other advisors and representatives. In no event shall either partys directors, officers, stockholders, agents or representatives have any personal liability for any misrepresentation or breach in connection with this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Confidentiality_. In the event of a termination of this Agreement, neither Fulton nor Columbia nor The Columbia Bank shall use or disclose to any other person any confidential information obtained by it during the course of its investigation of the other party or parties, except as may be necessary in order to establish the liability of the other party or parties for breach as contemplated under Section 8.2(b) herein. 

  

 Section 8.3 Amendment. To the extent permitted by law, this Agreement may be amended at any time before the Effective Time (whether before or after the authorization, approval and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Columbia), but only by a written instrument duly authorized, executed and delivered by Fulton and by Columbia; provided, however, that any amendment to the provisions of Section 2.1 herein relating to the consideration to be received by the former stockholders of Columbia in exchange for their shares of Columbia Common Stock shall not take effect until such amendment has been approved, adopted or ratified by the stockholders of Columbia in accordance with applicable provisions of the GCL. 

  

 Section 8.4 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived, to the extent permitted by applicable federal and state law, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof at any time before the Effective Time (whether before or after the authorization, approval and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Columbia) by a written instrument duly authorized, executed and delivered by such party or parties.
