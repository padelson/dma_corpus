FINANCIAL CORPORATION</B>, a Pennsylvania business corporation having its administrative headquarters
at One Penn Square, P.O. Box 4887, Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17604 (&#147;<B>Fulton</B>&#148;), and <B>COLUMBIA BANCORP</B>,
a Maryland corporation having its administrative headquarters at 7168 Columbia Gateway Drive,
Columbia, Maryland 21046 (&#147;<B>Columbia</B>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>BACKGROUND:</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulton is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended (the &#147;<B>BHC Act</B>&#148;). Columbia is a bank holding company registered under the BHC Act and is
the parent of The Columbia Bank, a Maryland trust company (&#147;<B>The Columbia Bank</B>&#148;). In addition to
The Columbia Bank, Columbia has three 100% directly owned subsidiaries: Columbia Bancorp Statutory
Trust I, Columbia Bancorp Statutory Trust II and Columbia Bancorp Statutory Trust III, which were
formed in connection with Columbia&#146;s issuance of trust preferred securities (the &#147;<B>Columbia Trust
Preferred Securities</B>&#148;). The Columbia Bank has four 100% directly owned subsidiaries: McAlpine
Enterprises, Inc., Howard I, LLC and Howard II, LLC, which are used primarily to manage properties
acquired through foreclosure, and Columbia Leasing, Inc., which is an inactive commercial leasing
company. The Columbia Bank and all other wholly-owned subsidiaries of Columbia and The Columbia
Bank are collectively referred to herein as the &#147;<B>Columbia Subsidiaries</B>&#148;. The Boards of Directors of
Fulton and Columbia have determined that it is in the best interests of Fulton and Columbia,
respectively, to merge with each other, resulting in The Columbia Bank becoming a subsidiary of
Fulton. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the foregoing transaction will be
accomplished by means of a merger (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;) in which (i)&nbsp;Columbia will be merged with and into
Fulton, (ii)&nbsp;Fulton will survive the Merger, and (iii)&nbsp;all of the outstanding shares of the common
stock of Columbia, $ .01 par value per share (&#147;<B>Columbia Common Stock</B>&#148;), will be converted into cash
and shares of the common stock of Fulton, par value $2.50 per share, and the associated Fulton
