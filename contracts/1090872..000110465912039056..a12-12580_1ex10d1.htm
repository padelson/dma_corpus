interpreted against a Party as a consequence of such Party having drafted one
or more of the provisions of the Agreement.

(iv) the Adjustment Amount, if any. The Buyer must procure that the Group
makes available and gives the Seller and its advisors access during usual
business hours and upon 2 Business Days notice to all necessary information
and relevant employees within the Group as well as to the Group Companies
auditors to enable the Seller to prepare the draft Final Purchase Price
Calculation within the timeframe set forth herein.

 



 

11.2.2 If the Buyer does not notify the Seller of an objection to the Sellers
draft of the Final Purchase Price Calculation in accordance with the
procedures of clause 11.2.3, it will be final and binding on the Parties and
the Adjustment Amount payable, if any, and by which Party, shall be determined
by reference to such Final Purchase Price Calculation.

 



 

11.2.3 If the Buyer disagrees with any element of the Sellers draft of the
Final Purchase Price Calculation, the Buyer must give Notice of an Objection
to the Seller no later than 30 Business Days after delivery of the Sellers
draft of the Final Purchase Price Calculation. The Buyer must describe in
detail the Disputed Matters, include the Buyers calculation of the Final
Purchase Price Calculation and refer to the provisions of the Agreement that
the Buyer invokes in support of its position, including which adjustments to
the Adjustment Amount, if any, the Buyer requests. Unless (i) any Objection
has been served on the Seller within the time frame stipulated above and (ii)
the Objection contains all such information as specified in the immediate
preceding sentence, the draft Final Purchase Price Calculation prepared by the
Seller will be final and binding on the Parties.

 



 

11.2.4 Subject to clause 11.2.5, if the Buyer gives Notice of an Objection in
accordance with clause 11.2.3, the Parties must attempt to reach an agreement
on the Disputed Matters no later than 15 Business Days after the Sellers
receipt of the Objection. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement
within this time limit, either Party may demand that the Disputed Matters be
referred to the Expert.

 



 

(a) The Expert will resolve the Disputed Matters by determining the proper
value of the items which are subject of the Disputed Matters in accordance
with the Agreement, including clause 5. The Experts decision on the Disputed
Matters must be within the range of the values proposed for such Disputed
Matter by the Buyer and the Seller. If the determination of the Disputed
Matters depends on an accounting estimate, the Expert must make an independent
estimate on the basis of what he considers to be fair and reasonable under the
Agreement and consistent with the Groups Accounting Principles. If his
independent determination is outside the range proposed by the Parties, his
determination will be deemed to be equal to the value proposed by the Party
which was closest to such determination. The Expert is not authorized to
decide on any legal dispute concerning the interpretation of the Agreement.
Any such dispute must be resolved in accordance with clause 15. Upon
determination of the Disputed Matters, the Expert will prepare a Final
Purchase Price Calculation implementing his determination on the Disputed
Matters (but without making any changes to any elements of the Final Purchase
Price Calculation which were not Disputed Matters).

 



 

(b) The Final Purchase Price Calculation prepared by the Expert will be final
and binding on the Parties, and it can only be challenged in accordance with
clause 15 in the event of fraudulent acts or obvious errors. The Adjustment
Amount payable, if any, shall be determined by reference to such Final
Purchase Price Calculation.

       
 

 



 

(c) The Expert will make decisions as to the apportionment of his fees and
other costs between the Parties, taking into account the amount by which each
Partys calculation of the Purchase Price deviated from the Purchase Price
determined by him.

 



 

11.2.5 Any Disputed Matters in a Notice of Objection given by the Buyer
relating to the line item entitled "Corporate Tax Payables" in the table in
Schedule 5.1(b) shall be disregarded and not referred to the Expert, unless
the Sellers estimate delivered under clause 10.3(a) is based on manifest
error on the part of the Seller.

 



 

11.2.6 No later than 5 Business Days after the Final Purchase Price
Calculation has become final and binding on the Parties in accordance with
this clause 11.2, the Adjustment Amount (together with the Interest accrued on
the Adjustment Amount from the Closing Date through the date of payment) must
be paid in immediately available funds by the Seller to the Buyer, or by Buyer
to the Seller, as applicable, provided that

 



 

(a) if the Adjustment Amount is to be paid by the Buyer to the Seller, 10% of
the Adjustment Amount shall be paid by the Buyer into the Escrow Account and
payment of such portion of the Adjustment Amount into the Escrow Account and
the remainder to the Seller shall fully discharge the Buyers obligation under
this clause 11.2.6; and

 



 

(b) if the Adjustment Amount is to be paid by the Seller to the Buyer, 10% of
the Adjustment Amount shall be released from the Escrow Account in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement and such release together with the payment by the
Seller to the Buyer of the remainder of the Adjustment Amount shall fully
discharge the Sellers obligation under this clause 11.2.6.

 



 

11.3 _Bookkeeping._ Following the Closing, the Buyer must ensure that the
Group stores its bookkeeping records as required by the Danish Bookkeeping Act
( _bogf øringsloven_) or similar applicable local legislation, and that the
Seller and the Sellers advisors will be able to gain access to such records
within normal business hours in relation to clause 11.

12.3 The Guarantor has made the Warranties described in clause 12.2 to the

property rights and prospects, including through review of the Due Diligence
Information as set out in _Schedule 12.4_. The Buyer acknowledges that it has
been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, premises and
records of the Group for such purpose.

 



 

 **13** ** ****SELLER S LIABILITY, LIMITATIONS AND CLAIMS PROCEDURE**

 



 

13.1 _Survival; Liability for Breach._ In the event of any Breach by Seller of
this Agreement, the Seller must indemnify and hold the Buyer harmless against
and from any Loss in accordance with the general rules of Danish law, subject
to the limitations stated in this clause 13; _provided_ that the Seller shall
be entitled to remedy a Breach capable of being remedied within 20 Business
Days after receipt of the Buyers Notice of the Claim, and the Claim and such
Breach will cease to exist if the Seller, at its sole cost and expense,
remedies the Breach before expiry of this deadline.

 



 

13.2 _Calculation of Loss_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Seller shall not be liable for any indirect or consequential loss,
punitive damages, diminution in value or loss of profits, or any Loss which
(i) has been taken into account in calculation of the Final Purchase Price
Calculation or (ii) was caused by a failure of the Buyer to consent to any
action pursuant to clause 6.1. The Buyers Loss shall be calculated as the
Buyers or any Group Companys direct loss on a DKK 1 for DKK 1 basis without
regard to any methods of calculation (P/E, EBITDA multiple or similar method)
used for the determination of the Enterprise Value.

 



 

13.2.1 The effect of any Loss on any tax asset of the Group (by reducing the
Buyers or any Group Companys possibility to utilise such tax asset) shall
not be regarded as a Loss under this Agreement. This clause 13.2.1 shall not
apply to any tax asset taken into account in calculating the Final Net Debt or
Final Working Capital.

 



 

13.2.2 When calculating a Loss, the Buyer must take into account any amount
that the Buyer or a Group Company has received or is able to receive after
using reasonable commercial efforts from a third party as a result of the
Breach or the Loss, and any such amount must be set off against the Buyers
Claim, including (i) any net tax benefit as a result of such Breach or Loss
that the Buyer or a Group Company is reasonably able to utilise and (ii) any
insurance payment that the Buyer or a Group Company has received or which is
recoverable in respect of such Loss (or which it would actually have been able
to recover under the insurance policies in place at the Closing).

 



 

13.2.3 Any loss will not be considered a Loss under the Agreement to the
extent that it is caused or increased as a direct result of voluntary acts or
omissions of the Buyer or any Group Company after Closing (other than any acts
or omissions carried out (i) in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practice of the Group prior to Closing (provided that nothing in
this clause shall limit the Buyers obligation to mitigate Loss pursuant to
clause 13.3 upon the Buyer becoming aware that to continue with such act or
omission would cause or increase a Loss) or (ii) pursuant to the requirements
of any law or legally binding obligation created on or before Closing) or to
the extent that it would not have arisen but for changes in laws, regulations
or practices of any Governmental Authority not finally enacted and published
on the Signing Date.

 



 

13.3 _Mitigation_. The Buyer is required to mitigate any Loss in accordance
with the general rules of Danish law. In furtherance of the foregoing, except
where to do so would materially prejudice the interests of the Buyer or any
Group Company, Buyer undertakes and agrees to use reasonable efforts to
recover from a third party any Loss for which an indemnity payment hereunder
may be due. If the Buyer receives payment from a third party in respect of a
Loss subsequent to an indemnification payment by Seller against which the
Seller has already indemnified the Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly reimburse
the Seller up to the amount paid by the Seller in indemnification hereunder.

      
 

 



 

13.4 _Limitations_

 



 

13.4.1 The Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer in respect
of any Loss in respect of a Breach if the Buyer fails to give Notice (in
accordance with clause 13.5) of the Claim to the Seller no later than 11:59 pm
CET on the day 15 months following the Closing Date (the period between
Closing and such time being the " **Warranty** **Survival Period** ").

 



 

13.4.2 The Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer in respect
of any Loss caused by a Breach of any of the Warranties unless:

 



 

(a) the amount of such Loss arising from a single Beach or series of related
Breaches of any of the Warranties exceeds DKK 4,000,000 (the " **De Minimis
Threshold** "); and

 



 

(b) the total amount of the Buyers Losses in respect of all such Breaches of
the Warranties (each exceeding the De Minimis Threshold), is in excess of DKK
80,000,000 (the " **Basket** ") in which case the Seller shall only be liable
for such part of the Loss exceeding DKK 40,000,000.

 



 

13.4.3 The Sellers maximum aggregate liability for all Losses in respect of
all such Breaches of the Warranties shall be limited to 10% of the Purchase
Price in the aggregate (the " **Cap** ").

 



 

13.4.4 The limitations in clause 13.4 do not apply to any Breach of any of the
Warranties arising out of or as a result of fraud or willful misrepresentation
or in respect of Breach of any of the Title Warranties.

 



 

13.4.5 Any payment by any Party in respect of a claim under this Agreement
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, which shall be
reduced or increased by the amount of such payment (as the case may be).

 



 

13.5 _Claims procedure_

 



 

13.5.1 The Buyer shall give Notice to the Seller (in accordance with clause
16.1) promptly and in any event within 30 Business Days after the Buyer
becomes aware of the events or circumstances giving rise to the Claim. The
Buyers Notice must include a detailed description of the Claim, its actual
and legal basis and a calculation of the Loss or the estimated Loss together
with reasonable supporting documentation. No delay by or failure of the Buyer
in complying with any of the obligations in this clause 13.5.1 shall affect
its rights in respect of the Claim, except to the extent that such delay or
failure increases the amount that the Buyer would otherwise be entitled to
claim.

 



 

13.5.2 The Seller shall have a period of 30 Business Days from receipt of the
Notice of Claim to dispute such Claim by providing Notice that the Seller
disputes such claim in accordance with clause 16.1.

 



 

13.5.3 If the Seller provides Notice that it disputes such Claim, in full or
in part, within the period described in clause 13.5.2 the Buyer may request
arbitration in accordance with clause 15.2 and if it so requests, shall serve
its written complaint ( _klageskrift_ ) on the Seller within 60 Business Days
after the Buyer has received Notice that the Seller disputes the Claim. If the
written complaint is not served within such period, the Seller will be
released from any and all obligations to indemnify the Buyer against the Loss
arising from the Claim in question or any other alleged Loss based on
substantially the same events or circumstances. If the Seller fails to provide
Notice that it disputes the Claim within the period described in clause
13.5.2, the Seller shall be deemed to accept the Claim and shall indemnify the
Buyers Loss.

 



 

13.5.4 If the grounds for a Claim in relation to any of the Sellers
Warranties arise as a result of, or in connection with, a claim by, or alleged
liability to, a third party (a " **Third Party Claim** "),

      
 

 



 

the Buyer shall have exclusive conduct of the defense of any Third Party Claim
and, subject to the limitations set forth in this clause, shall be entitled to
control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at its own
expense. The Buyer shall obtain the prior written consent of the Seller (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering
into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not
release the Seller and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations,
including hereunder, with respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement
imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, provided that the Seller shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice
for such purpose at its own expense.

 



 

13.5.4.1 Each Party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in
the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause
to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

13.5.4.2 The Buyer must keep the Seller informed on an on-going basis of any
significant developments in the matter.

 



 

13.6 _Exclusivity_. After Closing, the rights described in this clause 13 (and
clause 16.7) shall be the Buyers exclusive remedy for Breach, including the
Sellers Breach of any of the Warranties. Except for the situations described
in clause 9, the Buyer is not entitled to terminate ( _h aeve_) the Agreement
or demand a proportionate reduction of the Purchase Price ( _forholdsm aessigt
afslag_) except that the Buyer shall be entitled to rescind the Agreement in
the event of Breach of any of the Title Warranties. The Buyer hereby waives
any other rights and claims Buyer may have against Seller, whether at law or
in equity, relating to the Group or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
rights and claims waived by Buyer include claims for contribution or other
rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any environmental law
(whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach
of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other
claims for breach of duty. Other than in relation to fraud or wilful
misrepresentation, the Buyer expressly waives any right to claim damages from
the present or former members of the board of directors or management of the
Group, or from members of the board of directors or management of the Seller
or its Affiliates with respect to any act or omissions of such individuals, in
each case, in their aforementioned capacities prior to the Closing Date and
the Buyer shall seek its remedy against the Seller exclusively under the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **14** ** ****CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICATION**

 



 

14.1 The Parties shall treat as strictly confidential all information received
or obtained as a result of entering into or performing this Agreement,
including all information relating to (i) the terms of the Agreement; and (ii)
all information concerning the other Party and the Group. All such information
shall be treated as "Confidential Information" under and shall be subject to
the restrictions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement between the
parties dated 22 February 2012 (as amended).

 



 

14.2 Notwithstanding clause 14.1, promptly after the Signing Date, each of the
Parties will issue a press release in the agreed terms attached as _Schedule
14.2_.

 



 

 **15** ** ****GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES**

 



 

15.1 The Agreement is governed by and will be interpreted in accordance with
Danish law, excluding its conflicts of law rules.

      
 

 



 

15.2 Except in relation to Disputed Matters in connection with the
finalisation of the Final Purchase Price Calculation pursuant to clause 11
(which shall be resolved in accordance with clause 11.2), any dispute arising
out of or in connection with the Agreement, including any dispute concerning
its existence or validity, that cannot be settled between the Parties within
20 Business Days of that dispute arising shall be referred to and finally
settled by arbitration under the Rules of the London Court of International
Arbitration (the " **LCIA Rules** ") in force when the request for arbitration
is submitted, which LCIA Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into
this clause.

 



 

15.3 The arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators. Each Party will
nominate one arbitrator and the two arbitrators thus nominated shall nominate
the third arbitrator and notify the parties to the arbitration and the LCIA
Court of such nomination. If a Party fails to nominate an arbitrator in
accordance with the LCIA Rules, or if the two initially appointed arbitrators
fail to agree on the identity of the third arbitrator within 15 days of the
appointment of the second arbitrator, the LCIA Court will appoint the third
arbitrator. The third arbitrator shall act as chairman of the Arbitral
Tribunal. All arbitrators will be qualified lawyers with at least 15 years
experience of international commercial transactions and at least 5 years
experience of sitting as an arbitrator in disputes relating to international
commercial transactions.

 



 

15.4 The seat or legal place of the arbitration proceedings will be London
(although hearings may take place in Copenhagen if the parties to the
arbitration agree) and the language of the proceedings will be English.

 



 

15.5 Each Party shall pay the fees and other costs of its own advisors in
connection with the arbitration. The arbitration shall determine the
apportionment of its fees and other costs between the Parties taking the
outcome of the arbitration into account.

 



 

15.6 The Parties are not entitled to disclose any confidential information
relating to the arbitration proceedings to any third party, including
information on any decision or arbitration award, unless the other Party has
consented in writing to such disclosure. However, either Party is entitled to
disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to a third party
if such disclosure is made to protect its interests in relation to the other
Party or to comply with current legislation or public authority decisions, or
if such disclosure is required under any listing agreements.

 



 

 **16** ** ****OTHER PROVISIONS**

 



 

16.1 Any Notice to be given under the Agreement must be in writing and
delivered by hand or sent by registered mail, by fax or by email to the
addresses stated in _Schedule 16.1_.

 



 

16.2 No Party is entitled to assign, in full or in part, the rights and
obligations set out in the Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Party.

 



 

16.3 If the Parties agree to amend the Agreement, such agreement must be made
in a writing signed by both Parties.

 



 

16.4 Unless otherwise explicitly stated in the Agreement, each Party will pay
its own costs and expenses relating to the negotiations, drafting and
conclusion of the Agreement and the fulfilment of the obligations of the
Agreement (including all fees for its own legal, financial or other advisors),
and except where otherwise specified, exercise of any rights under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Group Companies shall not bear any
costs or expenses relating to the foregoing and any such costs or expenses
incurred by any Group Company prior to the Closing shall be paid by the
Seller, and any costs or expenses incurred by any Group Company after the
Closing shall be paid by the Buyer.

      
 

 



 

16.5 This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received
a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party. Until and unless each Party
has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



 

16.6 If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, but
would be valid and enforceable if deleted in part or reduced in application,
such provision shall apply with such deletion or modification as may be
necessary to make it valid and enforceable. Without prejudice to the
foregoing, if any provision is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, such provision shall to that extent be deemed
not to form part of this Agreement, but the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 



 

16.7 The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

The Agreement has been executed in 3 original copies, each Party and the
Guarantor receiving 1 copy.
