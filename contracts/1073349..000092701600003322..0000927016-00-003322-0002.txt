________________________________________________________________________________

(2)  Each of the Warranties set out in the several paragraphs of Schedule 5 is

     in this agreement is not limited:

     (a)  by reference to any other paragraph of Schedule 5; or

     been incurred an amount equal to any deficiency or liability of the Company
     concerned which arises from any of the Warranties being untrue, misleading
     or breached and which would not have existed or arisen if the Warranty in

          sub-clause 5 or the corresponding provision in the Tax Deed) exceeds
          (Pounds)50,000; and

     (c)  shall terminate;

          (i)  subject to clause 5(6)(b) on the first anniversary of Completion

               of Schedule 5 and any other matters so far as they relate to
               taxation; and

          (ii) on the first anniversary of Completion in respect of all other
               matters contained in Schedule 5,

          except in respect of any claim of which notice in writing stating in
          reasonable detail the nature of the claim (and if possible the amount
          claimed) is given to the Sellers or the Sellers' Solicitors before
          that date,

     (d)  The Liability of the Sellers under Warranty A4 shall not exceed the
          Consideration.

(6)  (a)  The Sellers' Representative undertakes on behalf of all the Sellers to
          effect and maintain insurance (the "Insurance") in accordance with the
          instructions of the Purchaser but not to be less than for a period to
          the third anniversary of Completion (such instructions to be given no
          later than 120 days from Completion), with regard to liability to
          taxation, arising or incurred in respect of those matters set out in
          part D (Taxation) of Schedule 5 and/or the Tax Deed.  The parties
          hereby agree that the cost of effecting and maintaining such insurance
          shall not exceed $250,000, fifty percent of such cost to be borne by
          the Sellers and deposited by them in the First Retention and Escrow
          Account in accordance with the terms therein and the remaining cost to
          be borne by the Purchaser.

     (b)  In the event that insurance is effected, or if the Sellers'
          Representative does not comply with the Purchaser's reasonable
          instruction as detailed above, the Tax Term shall increase to the
          third anniversary of Completion and the liability of the Sellers under
          the taxation warranties and/or the Tax Deed by the amount of the
          Insurance or if insurance is not effected due to the reason of the
          Seller's Representative failing to comply with the Purchaser's
          reasonable instructions by the amount of US$8 million.

     (c)  For the avoidance of doubt, if insurance is effected and maintained
          between Completion and the third anniversary then the Sellers shall
          have no liability whatsoever for any claim set out in part D
          (Taxation) of Schedule 5 and/or the Tax Deed other than as provided
          for and paid (regardless of any excess or other limitations imposed by
          the policy relating to the Insurance) in full by the Insurance.

(7)  Any payment made by the Sellers in respect of a breach of the Warranties or
     a liability under the Tax Deed shall be deemed to be a reduction in the
     Consideration.

(8)  Except for Warranty A.4 and which shall not be limited in any way, the
     Sellers' liability under the Warranties shall be limited as detailed in
     Schedule 6.

(9)  The liability of the Sellers for Warranty A.4 in Schedule 5 and for the
     covenants under clause 2(1), 2(2) and 2(3) is several.

          body) disclose or divulge to any third party any information of a
          secret or confidential nature relating to the business or affairs of
          any Company or its customers or suppliers; or

     (f)  use or (insofar as he can reasonably do so) allow to be used (except
          by the Companies) any trade name used by a Company at Completion or
          any other name intended or likely to be confused with such a trade
          name.

(2)  For the purposes of subclause (1) above:

     (a)  a Key Executive is concerned in a business if he carries it on as
          principal or agent or if:

          (i)   he is a partner, director, employee, secondee, consultant or
                agent in, of or to any person who carries on the business; or

          (ii)  he has any direct or indirect financial interest (as shareholder
                or otherwise) in any person who carries on the business; or

          (iii) he is a partner, director, employee, secondee, consultant or
                agent in, of or to any person who has a direct or indirect
                financial interest (as shareholder or otherwise) in any person
                who carries on the business,

          disregarding any financial interest of a person in securities which
          are listed or traded on any generally recognised market if that
          person, the Key Executive and any person connected with him or them
          (the "Investors") are together interested in securities which amount
          to less than five per cent. of the issued securities of that class and
          which, in all circumstances, carry less than five per cent. of the
          voting rights (if any) attaching to the issued securities of that
          class, and provided that none of the Investors is involved in the
          management of the business of the issuer of the securities or of any
          person connected with it other than by the exercise of voting rights
          attaching to the securities; and

     (b)  references to a Company include its successors in business;


     (c)  the restrictions in this clause 8 shall not apply to N Savory or P
          Fannon respectively  if the respective individual is dismissed by the
          Company from its employ for reasons other for gross misconduct.

(3)  Each of the restrictions in each paragraph or subclause above shall be
     enforceable by the Purchaser independently of each of the others and its
     validity shall not be affected if any of the others is invalid.

________________________________________________________________________________


(4)  If any of those restrictions is void but would be valid if some part of the
     restrictions were deleted the restriction in question shall apply with such
     modification as may be necessary to make it valid.

(5)  The Key Executives acknowledge that the above provisions of this clause are
     no more extensive than is reasonable to protect the Purchaser as the
     purchaser of the Shares.

(6)  If by virtue of any provision of this agreement or of any other agreement
     or arrangement of which this agreement forms part, such agreement or
     arrangement is subject to registration under the Restrictive Trade
     Practices Act 1976 (as amended) and is not a non-notifiable agreement, none
     of the parties to such agreement or arrangement who carries on business
     within the United Kingdom shall give effect to, or enforce or purport to
     enforce the agreement or arrangement in respect of any such provision until
     the day after particulars of the agreement or arrangement have been
     furnished to the Director General of Fair Trading under section 24 of that
     Act.

(7)  The Key Executives covenant with the Purchaser to procure that all relevant
     records, papers and information (including, without limitation, records and
     working papers of any and all accountants of the Company), required by the
     Purchaser to prepare and submit the financial statements required by Item 7
     of Form 8-K shall be made available to the Purchaser within the period
     contemplated by instruction B to such Form.

(8)  For the avoidance of doubt and for the purposes of this clause 8 the
     "business carried on by the Company at Completion" shall not include the
     electro-mechanical business of Checkpoint Security Services Limited carried
     on prior to Completion.

9.   COMPLETION

                 contained a statement in accordance with section 394 of the
                 Companies Act and that the amount due to them by each Company
                 on account of fees and expenses does not in aggregate exceed

          (xii)  written undertakings from Smith and Williamson to co-operate

10.  GUARANTEES

(1)  The Sellers shall procure that on Completion each Company is released from
     all guarantees and indemnities given by it other than a guarantee or

(2)  The Purchaser shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that as from
     Completion each Seller is released from all guarantees and indemnities
     given by him in respect of obligations of any Company and of which full
     particulars are contained in the Disclosure Letter and pending his release

     The Sellers shall procure that all bank accounts (the "Bank Account")
     maintained by the Company shall at Completion contain in unconditionally
     cleared funds  the sum of (Pounds)360,000 (the "Balance").  If the Bank
     Account contains a sum less than the Balance (the "Shortfall") the Sellers
     shall on demand pay to the Purchaser in cleared funds a sum equal to the
     Shortfall.


12.  REGISTRATION RIGHTS

(1)  Required Registration of Demand Shares
     --------------------------------------

     Immediately following the Completion, the Sellers who hold in aggregate at
     least 270,000 shares (representing 20% of the Consideration Shares) may
     request in writing, on no more than two occasions during the first twenty-
     four months following the Completion, that the Purchaser register for sale
     under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Securities Act") a
     number of Consideration Shares which shall neither (i) exceed in the
     aggregate a number equal to (A) $35,000,000 divided by (B)

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      14

________________________________________________________________________________


     the average last reported sale price per share of the Purchaser's Common
     Stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten consecutive trading days
     preceding the date of this Agreement nor (ii) in either instance be less
     than the number equal to (A) $7,000,000 divided by (B) the last reported
     sale price per share of the Purchaser's Common Stock on the Nasdaq National
     Market for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the date of this
     Agreement (the "Demand Shares"). The Purchaser shall file with the
     Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), within 60 days following
     receipt of any such request, a registration statement on Form S-3 covering
     the resale to the public by the Sellers of the Demand Shares (the "Seller
     Registration Statement"). The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause
     the Seller Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as
     soon as practicable, provided that the Seller Registration Statement shall
                          --------
     not be declared effective until after the Purchaser has filed a Form 8-K
     covering the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, if such Form 8-K
     is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 13a-11 or Rule 15d-11 of the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Purchaser shall cause the
     Seller Registration Statement to remain effective until the date two years
     after the date of Completion or such earlier time as all of the Demand
     Shares covered by the Seller Registration Statement have been sold pursuant
     thereto.

(2)  Limitations on Registration Rights
     ----------------------------------

     (a)  The Purchaser may, by written notice to the Sellers, (i) delay the
          filing or effectiveness of the Seller Registration Statement or (ii)
          suspend the Seller Registration Statement after effectiveness and
          require that the Sellers immediately cease sales of shares pursuant to
          the Seller Registration Statement, in the event that (A) the Purchaser
          files a registration statement (other than a registration statement on
          Form S-8 or its successor form) with the SEC for a primary public
          offering of its securities for acquisition purposes, financing or
          otherwise, or (B) the Purchaser is engaged in any activity or
          transaction or preparations or negotiations for any activity or
          transaction the disclosure of which would be adverse in its reasonable
          judgement, if the Purchaser determines in good faith that the public
          disclosure requirements imposed on the Purchaser under the Securities
          Act in connection with the Seller Registration Statement would require
          disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations or
          negotiations; provided that, in such event: (A) Such Sellers shall be
          entitled to withdraw any such request made under subclause (1) and, if
          withdrawn, such request shall not count as one of the two requests for
          required registration of Demand Shares permitted under subclause 1,
          and (B) the 12 month period for required registration of Demand Shares
          pursuant to subclause 1 shall be tolled for the duration of the
          resultant delay or suspension.  Notwithstanding anything to the
          contrary herein, in any 365-day period, the Purchaser shall not
          exercise its rights under this subclause 2(a) to suspend sales of
          Demand Shares (i) more than twice or (ii) for a total period in excess
          of 120 days.

     (b)  If the Purchaser delays or suspends the Seller Registration Statement
          or requires the Sellers to cease sales of shares pursuant to paragraph
          (a) above,

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      15

________________________________________________________________________________


          the Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable following the
          termination of the circumstance which entitled the Purchaser to do so
          with the Seller's approval, take such actions as may be necessary to
          file or reinstate the effectiveness of the Seller Registration
          Statement and/or give written notice to all Sellers authorizing them
          to resume sales pursuant to the Seller Registration Statement. If as a
          result thereof the prospectus included in the Seller Registration
          Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the
          Securities Act, the Purchaser shall enclose such revised prospectus
          with the notice to Sellers given pursuant to this paragraph (b), and
          the Sellers shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to the
          Seller Registration Statement other than by means of such revised
          prospectus.

(3)  Registration Procedures
     -----------------------

     (a)  In connection with the filing by the Purchaser of the Seller
          Registration Statement, the Purchaser shall furnish to each Seller a
          copy of the prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in
          conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act.

     (b)  The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to register or qualify the
          Demand Shares covered by the Seller Registration Statement under the
          securities laws of each state of the United States and do any and all
          other acts and things which may reasonably be necessary or advisable
          to enable the Sellers to consummate the disposition in such
          jurisdictions of the Consideration Shares owned by the Sellers;
          provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be required in
          --------  -------
          connection with this paragraph (b) to qualify as a foreign corporation
          or execute a general consent to service of process in any
          jurisdiction.

     (c)  If the Purchaser has delivered preliminary or final prospectuses to
          the Sellers and after having done so the prospectus is amended or
          supplemented to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act,
          the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers and, if requested by
          the Purchaser, the Sellers shall immediately cease making offers or
          sales of shares under the Seller Registration Statement and return all
          prospectuses to the Purchaser.  The Purchaser shall promptly provide
          the Sellers with revised or supplemented prospectuses and, following
          receipt of the revised or supplemented prospectuses, the Sellers shall
          be free to resume making offers and sales under the Seller
          Registration Statement.

     (d)  The Purchaser shall otherwise use all reasonable commercial efforts to
          comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make
          available to the Sellers, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
          earning statement covering the period of at least 12 months beginning
          with the first day of the Purchaser's first full calendar quarter
          after the effective date of the Seller Registration Statement, which
          earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of
          the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder.

                                      16

________________________________________________________________________________


     (e)  The Purchaser shall pay the expenses incurred by it in complying with
          its obligations under this clause 11, including all registration and
          filing fees, exchange listing fees, fees and expenses of counsel for
          the Purchaser, fees and expenses of accountants for the Purchaser and
          reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel retained by the Sellers
          who are not employees of the Company immediately prior to the
          Completion, for the purposes of rendering legal opinion on behalf of
          such non-employee Sellers in connection with any underwritten
          registration of Demand Shares or Incidental Registration, but
          excluding (i) any brokerage fees, selling commissions or underwriting
          discounts incurred by the Sellers in connection with sales under the
          Seller Registration Statement and (ii) the fees and expenses of any
          counsel retained by Sellers, other than as referred to in this clause
          11(e).

     (4)  Requirements of Sellers
          -----------------------

          The Purchaser shall not be required to include any Demand Shares in
          the Seller Registration Statement unless  the Seller owning such
          shares furnishes to the Purchaser in writing such information
          regarding such Seller and the proposed sale of Demand Shares by such
          Seller as the Purchaser may reasonably request in writing in
          connection with the Seller Registration Statement or as shall be
          required in connection therewith by the SEC or any state securities
          law authorities.

     (5)  Incidental Registration of Consideration Shares
          -----------------------------------------------

          (a)  Whenever the Purchaser proposes to file a registration statement
               (other than the Seller Registration Statement filed pursuant to
               subclause 1) at any time and from time to time until three years
               from the date of the Completion, it will, prior to such filing,
               give prompt written notice to the Sellers of its intention to do
               so; provided, that no such notice need be given if no
               Consideration Shares are to be included therein as a result of a
               determination of the managing underwriter pursuant to subclause
               5(b). Upon the written request of any Sellers given within 20
               days after the Purchaser provides such notice (which request
               shall state the intended method of disposition of such
               Consideration Shares), the Purchaser shall use its best efforts
               to cause all Consideration Shares which the Purchaser has been
               requested by such Sellers to register to be registered under the
               Securities Act to the extent necessary to permit their sale or
               other disposition in accordance with the intended methods of
               distribution specified in the request of such Sellers; provided
               that the Purchaser shall have the right to postpone or withdraw
               any registration effected pursuant to this subclause 5 without
               obligation to the Sellers.

     (b)  If the registration for which the Purchaser gives notice pursuant to
          subclause 5(a) is a registered public offering involving an
          underwriting, the Purchaser shall so advise the Sellers as a part of
          the written notice given pursuant to subclause 5(a).  In such event,
          the right of the Sellers to include their Consideration Shares in such
          registration pursuant to subclause 5 shall be

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      17

________________________________________________________________________________


          conditioned upon the Sellers' participation in such underwriting on
          the terms set forth herein. Should any Sellers propose to distribute
          the Consideration Shares through such underwriting, such Sellers shall
          enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
          underwriter or underwriters selected for the underwriting by the
          Purchaser. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subclause 5, if
          the managing underwriter advises the Purchaser in good faith that the
          inclusion of all shares requested to be registered would adversely
          affect the offering, the Purchaser may limit the number of
          Consideration Shares to be included in the registration and
          underwriting. The Purchaser shall so advise all holders of
          Consideration Shares requesting registration, and the number of shares
          that are entitled to be included in the registration and underwriting
          shall be allocated in the following manner. The securities of the
          Purchaser held by holders other than the Sellers and other holders of
          securities of the Purchasers who are entitled, by contract with the
          Purchaser, to have securities included in such registration ("Other
          Holders") shall be excluded from such registration and underwriting to
          the extent deemed advisable by the managing underwriter, and, if a
          further limitation on the number of shares is required, the number of
          shares that may be included in such registration and underwriting
          shall be allocated among the Sellers and Other Holders requesting
          registration in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the
          respective number of shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis)
          which they held at the time the Company gives the notice specified in
          subclause 5(a); provided that such registration rights of the Sellers
          and Other Holders shall be subordinate to the written registration
          rights of certain additional holders of securities of the Purchaser
          outstanding as of the date hereof. If the Sellers or any Other Holder
          requesting registration would thus be entitled to include more
          securities than such holder requested to be registered, the excess
          shall be allocated among the Sellers and Other Holders requesting
          registration pro rata in the manner described in the preceding
          sentence. If the Sellers requesting registration disapprove of the
          terms of any such underwriting, such Sellers may elect to withdraw
          therefrom by written notice to the Purchaser, and any Consideration
          Shares or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such
          underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration.

(6)  Indemnification
     ---------------

     (a)  The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller whose
          shares are included in any registration statement filed with the SEC
          pursuant to this clause 11 (the "Registration Statement") against any
          losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities to which such Seller
          may become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a material
          fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus, preliminary
          prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission to
          state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
          make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such
          losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities arise out of or are
          based upon information furnished to the Purchaser by or on behalf of a
          Seller in writing for use in the Registration Statement.  The
          Purchaser shall have the right to

________________________________________________________________________________


          assume the defense and settlement of any claim or suit for which the
          Purchaser may be responsible for indemnification under this subclause
          6.

     (b)  The Sellers agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser against
          any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities to which the
          Purchaser may become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a
          material fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus,
          preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
          omission to state therein a fact required to be stated therein or
          necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if the
          statement or omission was made in reliance on and in conformity with
          information relating to the Sellers furnished in writing to the
          Purchaser by or on behalf of the Sellers for use in connection with
          the preparation of the Registration Statement.  Provided that any such
          Seller's obligation to indemnify under this sub clause 6 (b) shall be
          individual, rather than joint and several, and shall be limited to the
          net amount of proceeds received by such Seller from the sale of
          Consideration Shares pursuant to such Registration Statement.

(7)  Assignment of Rights
     --------------------

     A Seller may not assign any of its rights under this clause 11 except in
     connection with the transfer of some or all of his, her or its
     Consideration Shares to a child or spouse, or trust for their benefit or,
     in the case of a partnership, to the partners of such partnership pursuant
     to a pro rata distribution, and in the case of MAM to its subsidiary,
     holding company or other affiliate provided each such transferee agrees in
                                       ---------
     a written instrument delivered to the Purchaser to be bound by the
     provisions of this clause 11.

(8)  Investment and Experience
     -------------------------

     Each Seller will hereby be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows
     (terms used herein that are defined in Regulation S under the Securities
     Act are used as defined therein):

     (a)  The Seller (i) is a non-U.S. person outside the United States
          acquiring the Consideration Shares for its own account, and (ii) is
          aware that such Consideration Shares are restricted securities and
          that such Consideration Shares may not be deposited into any
          unrestricted depositary facility in respect of the Shares established
          or maintained by a depositary bank, unless at the time of deposit such
          Consideration Shares are eligible for transfer in accordance with Rule
          144(k) under the Securities Act.

     (b)  The Seller understands that the Consideration Shares have not been
          registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered, resold,
          pledged or otherwise transferred except (i)(A) in an offshore
          transaction complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or (B)
          pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
          provided by Rule 144 thereunder (if available) and (ii)

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      19

________________________________________________________________________________


          in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the
          United States. No representation can be made as to the availability of
          the exemption provided by Rule 144 for resales of the Consideration
          Shares.

     (c)  If the Seller is acquiring Consideration Shares for the account of
          another person, it has full power to make the foregoing
          acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each
          such account.

     (d)  The Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser, its affiliates and others
          will rely on the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements,
          representations and agreements.

     Any resale or other transfer, or attempted resale or other transfer, made
     other than in compliance with the above-stated restrictions shall not be
     recognized by the Purchaser.

     Due to the restrictions on the offer and sale of securities in the United
     States, under U.S. securities laws and regulations, there can be no
     assurance that any offer of pre-emptive right will be open to U.S. holders
     of Consideration Shares.

     The Consideration Shares will bear a legend to the following effect, unless
     the Purchaser determines otherwise in compliance with applicable law:

          THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (DE), INC.
          REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
          OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT").  THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT
          BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED (NOR MAY IT
          OTHERWISE HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARES) EXCEPT (A)(1)
          IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION COMPLYING WITH RULE 903 OR RULE 904 OF
          REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (2) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION
          FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDE BY RULE 144
          THEREUNDER (IF AVAILABLE), AND (B) IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL
          APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.  NO REPRESENTATION
          CAN BE MADE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY RULE
          144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT FOR RESALE OF THE SHARES.


13.  Announcements

     announcement concerning this sale and purchase or any ancillary matter
