bank or intra-bank transfer, in accordance with Sellers\' written
instructions, and (c) Buyer shall deliver to Sellers the Purchase Price (as
adjusted pursuant to Section 3.3(a)), less the Indemnity Amount and, if

bank or intra-bank transfer, in accordance with Sellers\' written

either have been paid by Sellers out of the Indemnity Amount or are then
unresolved, and (ii) any amounts owed (or claimed by Buyer to be owed) by
Sellers or Parent under Section 3.3 which remain unpaid or the subject of a
dispute among Buyer and Sellers, shall be paid to Sellers on the date that is
180 days after the Closing Date; and

 

(b) the entire remaining unreleased portion of the Indemnity Amount, less (i)
the amount of any Claims made by Buyer in accordance with the terms of Section
10 of this Agreement that are then unresolved, and (ii) any amounts owed (or
claimed by Buyer to be owed) by Sellers or Parent under Section 3.3 which
remain unpaid or the subject of a dispute among Buyer and Sellers, shall be
paid to Sellers on the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

Sellers and Buyer will take such actions as may be required to cause the
Escrow Agent under the Post-Closing Escrow Agreement to deliver the Indemnity
Amount in accordance with the foregoing.

 

3.3 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

   

 1. The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment, as of 12:01 a.m. (St. Louis time) on the Closing Date (the " _Adjustment Time_ "), to, among other things, reflect the principle that all revenues and refunds, and all costs, expenses and liabilities, attributable to the operation of the System for any period prior to the Adjustment Time are for the account of Sellers, and all revenues and refunds, and all costs, expenses and liabilities (other than liabilities and obligations under contracts or other obligations of Sellers that are not Assumed Liabilities, which in any event will remain liabilities and obligations of Sellers) attributable to the operation of the System from and after the Adjustment Time are for the account of Buyer. The adjustments to be made to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) shall consist of the following:

 

(i) if the Adjustment Assets are in excess of the Adjustment Liabilities, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of such excess;

 

(ii) if the Adjustment Liabilities are in excess of the Adjustment Assets, the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of such excess;

 

(iii) whether or not Section 6.14 applies, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
(if the actual number of Equivalent Basic Subscribers is fewer than 235,000)
or increased (if the actual number of Equivalent Basic Subscribers is greater
than 235,000) by an amount equal to $3,255 multiplied by the difference
between 235,000 and the actual number of Equivalent Basic Subscribers;

 

(iv) whether or not Section 6.14 applies, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
(if the actual number of Data Subscribers is fewer than the Adjusted Data
Subscriber Target) or increased (if the actual number of Data Subscribers is
greater than the Adjusted Data Subscriber Target) by an amount equal to $1,800
multiplied by the difference between the Adjusted Data Subscriber Target and
the actual number of Data Subscribers; and

 

(v) if Section 6.14 applies, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount determined in accordance with Section 6.14. provided that the
application of clauses (iii) and (iv) above, taken together, shall not
increase the Purchase Price (i.e., the Purchase Price will be increased
pursuant to clause (iii) above only in the event of, and only to the extent
of, any reduction of the Purchase Price pursuant to clause (iv) above, and the
Purchase Price will be increased pursuant to clause (iv) above only in the
event of, and only to the extent of, any reduction of the Purchase Price
pursuant to clause (iii) above). The attached _Exhibit C_ sets forth
illustrations of the operation of this Section 3.3(a) and the computation of
the Adjustment Assets and the Adjustment Liabilities.

 

 2. Sellers shall deliver to Buyer, not fewer than seven Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a certificate signed by Sellers (the " _Pre-Closing Certificate_ "), which shall specify Sellers\' good faith estimate of the adjustments to the Purchase Price required under Section 3.3(a) (including estimates of the Adjustment Assets, Adjustment Liabilities, Equivalent Basic Subscribers and Data Subscribers), calculated as of the Adjustment Time. The Pre-Closing Certificate shall be accompanied by reasonably detailed documentation supporting the calculations set forth therein. Buyer may challenge the contents of the Pre-Closing Certificate within four Business Days following delivery thereof and the documentation described in the preceding sentence if Buyer believes, in good faith, that it is in error, by delivering a notice of disagreement to Sellers. If Buyer delivers a notice of disagreement to Sellers, then Buyer and Sellers shall use good faith efforts to resolve any disputes with respect to the Pre-Closing Certificate prior to the Closing Date and the amount of the Purchase Price paid to Seller at Closing shall be based on the adjustments to the Purchase Price as mutually agreed to by Sellers and Buyer. If Buyer does not deliver a notice of disagreement to Seller, the amount of the Purchase Price paid to Sellers at the Closing shall be based on the adjustments to the Purchase Price set forth in the Pre-Closing Certificate. 

 

 3. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a certificate signed by Buyer (the " _Post-Closing Certificate_ "), which shall set forth Buyer\'s final adjustments to the Purchase Price to be made pursuant to Section 3.3(a), together with reasonably detailed documentation supporting the calculations set forth therein; and, thereafter, Buyer shall provide Sellers with such other documentation relating to the Post-Closing Certificate as is available to Buyer and that Sellers may reasonably request. If Sellers wish to dispute the final adjustments to the Purchase Price to be made pursuant to Section 3.3(a), as reflected in the Post-Closing Certificate, Sellers shall, within 30 days after their receipt of the Post-Closing Certificate, serve Buyer with a written description of the disputed items (the " _Disputed Items_ ") together with such documentation as Buyer may reasonably request. If Sellers notify Buyer of their acceptance of the amounts set forth in the Post-Closing Certificate, or if Sellers fail to deliver their report of any Disputed Items within the 30-day period specified in the preceding sentence, the amounts set forth in the Post-Closing Certificate shall be conclusive, final and binding on Buyer and Sellers as of the last day of such 30-day period. If Sellers serve Buyer with a written description of Disputed Items within such 30-day period and Buyer and Seller do not resolve any Disputed Item within 30 days after Buyer\'s receipt of such written description, Buyer and Sellers shall, within the ten days following expiration of such 30-day period, appoint an independent public accounting firm of national reputation as is agreed upon by them to resolve the Disputed Items, _provided_ such firm is not the auditor for either Buyer or Sellers. The cost of retaining such firm shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers. Such firm shall report its determination in writing to Buyer and Sellers, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on Buyer and Sellers and shall not be subject to further dispute or review.

 

 4. If, as a result of any resolution reached by Buyer and Sellers, or any determination made by an accounting firm, in either case pursuant to Section 3.3(c), Buyer is finally determined to owe any amount to Sellers, or Sellers are finally determined to owe any amount to Buyer, the obligor(s) shall pay such amount to the obligee(s), in immediately available funds, within three Business Days of such determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall pay to Sellers or Sellers shall pay to Buyer, as the case may be, in immediately available funds, the amount due such obligee(s) with respect to any item that is not a Disputed Item within three Business Days of the date on which a dispute no longer exists, to an account or accounts specified in writing by the obligee(s). Any amount not paid by a Seller as required under this Section 3.3(d) will be paid by Parent.

  

3.4 _Instrument of Assignment and Assumption and Post-Closing Escrow
Agreement_.

 

At the Closing, Buyer and Sellers will execute and deliver a Bill of Sale and
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, in a form mutually agreeable to Buyer and
Sellers (the " _Bill of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement_ "), and
the Post-Closing Escrow Agreement.

 

3.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

   

Buyer and Sellers (acting unanimously) will use good faith efforts to agree on
the allocation of the Purchase Price payable to Sellers among the Assets. As
soon as practicable following the date hereof, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers
a proposed allocation; _provided_ , that such allocation shall be consistent
with Section 1060 of the IRC and applicable treasury regulations. Buyer and
Sellers shall file the forms required to be filed under Section 1060 of the
IRC consistent with any such agreed upon allocation. Subject to the first
sentence of this Section 3.5, each Seller\'s individual share of the Purchase
Price payable to Sellers (including any adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.3) shall be determined by reference to the agreed upon
allocation of the Purchase Price among all Assets as agreed by Buyer and
Sellers (acting unanimously) pursuant to this Section 3.5 (in the case of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 3.3, taking into account the
nature of such adjustment) and, unless otherwise unanimously agreed by
Sellers, the respective Assets owned by such Seller.

No Employee Plan ever has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined in Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA and Section 412(a) of the IRC, whether or not waived, and each Employee Plan otherwise always has fully met the funding standards required under Title I of ERISA and Section 412 of the IRC.

All contributions, premiums or payments accrued, in whole or in part, under each Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement or with respect thereto as of the Closing will be paid by Sellers, on or prior to Closing or, if later, within the time period permitted by ERISA and the IRC.

  

 7. Each Employee Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified plan" under Section 401(a) of the IRC has received a determination from the Internal Revenue Service that such Employee Plan is so qualified and nothing has occurred since the date of such determination that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan.

respect to any renewal request filed prior to Closing. True, complete and
correct copies of all correspondence between any Seller and any and all
Governmental Authorities concerning the renewal of any Applicable Franchise
have been and will be made available to Buyer in a timely manner. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 4.24_ , where any Franchise has expired, such Seller is
operating in such area lawfully and pursuant to interim authority from the
applicable Governmental Authority.

been made by each Seller severally and not jointly, provided, however, that to
the extent that the non-performance of any covenant required to be performed

Seller, each Seller shall be obligated to perform such covenant and Parent and
each Seller shall be liable for any non-performance of any such covenant to
the extent provided in Section 10.

   

6.1 _Continuity and Maintenance of Operations_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Buyer,

All financial statements so delivered will be prepared on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements attached as _Schedule 4.5_.

 

 4. Each Seller will cause its appropriate Affiliates to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Section 6.1 and this Agreement to the extent such Affiliates own, operate or manage any of the Assets or the System. Each Seller will cause any Affiliate which is a party to a System Contract or Governmental Authorization to assign such System Contract or Governmental Authorization to such Seller prior to the Closing Date so that such System Contract and Governmental Authorization shall be included in the Assets and conveyed to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 5. No Seller will, with respect to any Employee, except as required to comply with applicable law or as required to comply with existing contracts or plans that are disclosed on _Schedule 4.17_ or _Schedule 4.18_ , (i) increase or decrease in any manner the compensation or fringe benefits of any Employee (except for increases in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in connection with normal salary reviews), (ii) increase the number of Employees; (iii) voluntarily recognize any union as collective bargaining representative of any of the Employees; (iv) enter into a collective bargaining agreement governing the terms or condition of employment of any of the Employees; (v) enter into any government contract giving rise to affirmative action obligations relating to any of the Employees; or (vi) agree to do any of the foregoing.

6.2 _Access to Sellers; Confidentiality_.

   

 1. Upon reasonable advance notice, each Seller shall afford to Buyer or authorized representatives and advisors of Buyer (including Buyer\'s prospective financing sources and their respective representatives and advisors) reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices and properties of the System and the personnel engaged in the management of the System (including such access as may reasonably be required in order for a firm retained by Buyer to conduct "Phase I" non-invasive environmental assessments (per ASTM Standard E1527-97 or 00), which may also include environmental regulatory compliance reviews, with respect to any or all of the Real Property) and upon advance notice to Sellers and pursuant to such access terms as Sellers may reasonable require, to conduct additional invasive testing and investigation as is reasonable to evaluate any Recognized Environmental Conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM Standard E1527-00, the standard for environmental site assessments) identified by the Phase I environmental assessments. Subject to Section 6.2(b), Sellers will provide Buyer with either (at Sellers\' option) access to or with copies of books and records reasonably requested by Buyer.

 

 2. Prior to the Closing (or if the Closing does not occur and the Agreement is terminated, for a period of one year from the date of termination of this Agreement), Buyer shall: (i) use reasonable efforts to, and cause its representatives and the employees, representatives and agents of Buyer\'s equity and financing sources to, hold in strict confidence all information furnished to any of them by Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is not otherwise available to the public (the " _Confidential Information_ "), (ii) not solicit or cause to be solicited the employment of any Employee for employment other than with or for the System, and (iii) not, without the prior written consent of Sellers, release or disclose any Confidential Information to any other Person, except (A) to the extent required by applicable law, (B) as necessary in connection with filings, approvals and rulings to be obtained from any governmental agency, including, but not limited to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service (it being understood that any such filing may include the filing of a copy of this Agreement), including by reason of Buyer or any of its Affiliates issuing or offering securities, (C) to Buyer\'s equity and financing sources and its representatives who are informed by Buyer of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and agree to keep such information confidential on terms no less restrictive than those set forth in this Section 6.2(b), (D) as necessary to obtain consents to the transfer of any Franchise or License or any other Required Consent or otherwise necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (E) as otherwise permitted by the remainder of this Section 6.2. In the event Buyer or any Person to whom Buyer transmits Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, Buyer shall provide Sellers with prompt notice so that Sellers may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.2(b), or both. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that Sellers waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.2(b), Buyer shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required.

  

 3. Sellers will deliver to Buyer reasonably promptly after the date hereof, but in no event later than September 15, 2003, financial statements consisting of (x) an unaudited balance sheet relating to the System at December 31, 2001, and an unaudited statement of operations, cashflows and stockholders\' equity relating to the System for the one-year period then ended, and (y) unaudited statements of cashflows and stockholders\' equity for the System for the one-year period ended December 31, 2002 (together with the 2003 Unaudited Financial Statements, the Unaudited Quarterly Financial Statements, and the unaudited financial statements as of and for the periods ending September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2003 to be delivered pursuant to this Section 6.2(c), the " _Additional Unaudited Financial Statements_ "). If Buyer is not satisfied in its sole discretion with such December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002 financial statements, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice thereof to Sellers within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers\' delivery of such financial statements. If Buyer does not terminate this Agreement within such ten (10) Business Day period, Buyer shall thereafter have the right to cause KPMG LLP (" _KPMG_ ") to conduct an audit of the unaudited balance sheets relating to the System at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, and unaudited statements of operations, statements of cashflows and statements of stockholders\' equity for the one-year periods then ended. Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer unaudited balance sheets of the System at September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2003 and unaudited statements of operations, cashflows and stockholders\' equity for the nine-month periods then ended. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their past practices to deliver to Buyer the September 30, 2002 unaudited financial statements in a prompt manner but in any event Sellers will deliver such financial statements not later than September 15, 2003, and the September 30, 2003 unaudited financial statements in a prompt manner but in no event later than November 15, 2003, and upon such delivery, Buyer shall thereafter have the right to cause KPMG to conduct an audit of such September 30, 2003 financial statements. The audited balance sheets relating to the System at December 31, 2001, December 31, 2002 and September 30, 2003, and audited statements of operations, statements of cashflows and statements of stockholders\' equity for the one-year periods (in the case of the December financial statements) and the nine-month period (in the case of the September financial statements) then ended are collectively referred to, together with the 2003 Audited Financial Statements, as the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "). All costs and expenses associated with the audits in this Section 6.2(c), including but not limited to audit fees charged by KPMG, shall be shared equally by Buyer and Sellers. The Sellers shall direct KPMG to complete the audits in this Section 6.2(c) no later than December 3, 2003, and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such audit to be completed within such time. If the revenues reported in the Audited Financial Statements for any of the year ended December 31, 2001, the year ended December 31, 2002 or the nine-month period ending September 30, 2003 are less than 97% of the revenues of the System reported in the unaudited financial statements for the corresponding periods (it being agreed that for purposes of comparing the Audited Financial Statements for September 30, 2003 to the unaudited financial statements for June 30, 2003, the relevant period of comparison will be the six-month period ending June 30, 2003 as included in the Audited Financial Statements for September 30, 2003 and as set forth in the unaudited financial statements for June 30, 2003), Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice thereof to Sellers within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer\'s receipt of such Audited Financial Statements. 

 

 4. Irrespective of whether the Closing has theretofore occurred, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer an unaudited balance sheet of the System at December 31, 2003 and unaudited statements of operations, cashflows and stockholders\' equity of the System for the one-year period then ended (" _2003 Unaudited Financial Statements_ "). Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their past practices to deliver the 2003 Unaudited Financial Statements to Buyer in a prompt manner but in no event later than February 14, 2004. Upon delivery by Sellers of the 2003 Unaudited Financial Statements to Buyer, Buyer shall have the right to cause KPMG to conduct an audit of the 2003 Unaudited Financial Statements (the " _2003 Audited Financial Statements_ "). Sellers agree to reasonably cooperate in the conduct of such audit and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause KPMG to take such actions as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with the audit. The Sellers shall direct KPMG to complete such audit no later than March 29, 2004, and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such audit to be completed within such time. All costs and expenses associated with such audit, including but not limited to audit fees charged by KPMG, shall be Buyer\'s sole responsibility if the Closing occurs prior to March 29, 2004. If the Closing occurs on or after March 29, 2004, all costs and expenses associated with such audit, including but not limited to audit fees charged by KPMG, shall be shared equally by Buyer and Sellers. 

 

 5. Sellers will deliver to Buyer financial statements consisting of unaudited balance sheets relating to the System at the end of each fiscal quarter commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2002 and ending with the fiscal quarter ending immediately prior to the Closing Date, and unaudited statements of operations relating to the System for the quarterly period then ended (the " _Unaudited Quarterly Financial Statements_ "). Sellers will deliver such financial statements with reasonable promptness, but in no event later than November 30, 2003 or, if later, the 30th day after the end of any applicable fiscal quarter. Sellers will reasonably cooperate with Buyer and promptly provide Buyer with all additional financial statements, financial information and related documentation reasonably requested by Buyer from time to time in order for Buyer to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such cooperation will include access to financial information for the Systems for purposes of completing an audit or review of the period beginning on January 1, 2004 and ending on the Closing Date, and the provision of representation letters regarding such financial information as reasonably requested by KPMG. All costs and expenses associated with such cooperation shall be shared equally by Buyer and Sellers.

 

 6. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause KPMG to take such actions as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with Buyer\'s financing of the Purchase Price, including to: (i) cause KPMG to prepare the Audited Financial Statements in a form meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (ii) cause KPMG to provide Buyer with copies of draft audits and the related work papers prior to the issuance of such audits, (iii) obtain the consent of KPMG to the use of its report on the Audited Financial Statements, (iv) cause KPMG to deliver a "comfort letter" in a form meeting the requirements of SAS 72 or such other form as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (v) cause KPMG to perform a SAS 100 review of any interim unaudited financial statements, and (vi) cause KPMG to participate, at Buyer\'s request, in the preparation of any registration statement, prospectus or offering memorandum that includes, or incorporates by reference, the Audited Financial Statements. All costs and expenses associated with KPMG\'s actions set forth in this Section 6.2(f), including but not limited to fees charged by KPMG, shall be shared equally by Buyer and Sellers.

 

6.3 _Notification_.

  

Each party shall promptly notify the other of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation that is instituted or threatened against such party to restrain,
prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality or propriety of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or of any fact, event, circumstance or action
(a) which, if known on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be disclosed to the other party pursuant to this Agreement or (b) the
existence or occurrence of which would cause any of such party\'s
representations or warranties under this Agreement not to be correct and
complete in all material respects. The communication of any such information
shall not limit in any way any representations or warranties made by the
disclosing party or any obligations or liabilities for breach thereof.

 

6.4 _No Public Announcement_.

 

Prior to the Closing Date, neither party shall, without the approval of the
other, make any press release or other public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent such
party determines that such action is advisable or required by law, in which
case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be
issued.

 

6.5 _Regulatory Filings_.

 

Sellers and Buyer shall, promptly after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, file with the FTC and the DOJ the notification required to be filed
with respect to the transactions provided in this Agreement under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _HSR Act_ ") and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The parties shall: (i) respond
promptly to any requests for additional information made by such agencies and
(ii) resist vigorously at their respective cost and expense any assertion that
the transactions provided herein constitute a violation of the antitrust laws,
all to the end of expediting the Closing. Sellers and Buyer each shall pay
one-half of the filing fee associated with the filing of such notification
under the HSR Act.

 

6.6 _Employees; Employee Benefits; Labor Matters_.

   

 1. _Schedule 6.6(a)(1)_ sets forth a list of all Employees which Sellers desire to retain after the Closing and which shall not be subject to hire by Buyer (the " _Reserved Employees_ "). Not earlier than 45 days prior to the Closing, Sellers will provide to Buyer an updated list of all Employees, showing the original hire date, the then-current positions and rates of compensation, rate type (hourly or salary) and scheduled hours per week, leave status (i.e., whether actively employed or on vacation, sick, disability, military or other type of leave), and whether the Employee is subject to an employment agreement, a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor organization. Each Seller agrees to cooperate in all reasonable respects with Buyer to verify the updated list of Employees. Effective as of and contingent upon the Closing, Buyer shall make offers of employment to the persons who are identified on such updated list and who are Employees on the Closing Date but not to any Reserved Employees (each Employee who accepts Buyer\'s offer of employment and who becomes an employee of Buyer effective as of the Closing being a " _Transferred Employee_ "); _provided_ that, prior to the later of the 30th day prior to the Closing and the 15th day after Buyer receives the updated list described in the first sentence of this Section 6.6(a), Buyer shall notify each Seller in writing of the Employees identified on such updated list (which shall not exceed 15 in number) to whom Buyer intends not to offer employment (together with the Reserved Employees and any other Persons who are Employees on the Closing Date but who do not become employees of Buyer effective as of the Closing, the " _Retained Employees_ "), and Buyer will not be required to offer Employment to such Employees effective as of the Closing. If any Employee (an " _Employee on Leave Status_ ") is on Approved Leave of Absence as of the Closing, Buyer may condition such offer of employment upon the Employee\'s return to active service (with or without reasonable accommodations requirements) within sixteen weeks after the Closing or, if earlier, on the first Business Day following expiration of the Employee\'s Approved Leave of Absence. _Schedule 6.6(a)(2)_ sets forth each Employee on Leave Status as of the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, an Employee on " _Approved Leave of Absence_ " means an Employee absent from work on the Closing Date and unable to perform his or her regular job duties by reason of illness or injury under approved plans or policies of Sellers (other than an Employee\'s absence for less than ten days due to short term illness or injury not requiring written approval by the applicable Seller) or otherwise absent from work under approved or unpaid leave policies of Sellers. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Seller shall retain liability for all obligations and liabilities to the Retained Employees of such Seller incurred prior to the Closing Date and all obligations and liabilities under Employee Plans and Compensation Arrangements. 

 

 2. Buyer shall offer group health plan coverage to all Transferred Employees and their spouses and eligible dependents who are covered on the Closing Date under a group health plan maintained or contributed to by Buyer, and such coverage shall be the same, and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, as Buyer provides to similarly situated employees, _provided_ that such coverage shall be effective as of the Closing and that no pre-existing condition limitation shall be applied to any Transferred Employees, their spouses and eligible dependents unless, and only to the same extent that, such persons are subject to pre-existing condition limitations under Sellers\' group health plan described on _Schedule 6.6(b)_. Each Seller shall have full responsibility and liability for offering and providing "continuation coverage" to any "covered employee" of such Seller who is an Employee, and to any "qualified beneficiary" of such Employee, and who is covered by a "group health plan" sponsored or contributed to by such Seller (all such group health plans of Sellers individually and collectively called " _Sellers Health Plans_ ") to the extent that such continuation coverage is required to be provided by Sellers under COBRA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as a result of a "qualifying event" experienced by such covered employee or qualified beneficiary prior to the Closing Date or with respect to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. "Continuation coverage," "covered employee," "qualified beneficiary," "qualifying event" and "group health plan" all shall have the meanings given such terms under COBRA.

 

 3. _Schedule 6.6(c)_ sets forth accurate descriptions of Sellers\' vacation and sick leave policies. Sellers shall provide to Buyer a list of the accrued vacation and sick leave of each Transferred Employee when it delivers the Pre-Closing Certificate. Each Transferred Employee shall be credited under Buyer\'s vacation policy with the full amount of vacation accrued by such Transferred Employee but unused as of the Closing Date under the vacation policies of Seller applicable to such Transferred Employee.

 

 4. Nothing in this Agreement express or implied shall be deemed to make an Employee a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

  

 5. Sellers will allow Transferred Employees with outstanding loan balances under the Charter Communications Inc. 401(k) Plan to continue making loan payments thereunder for a period of 90 days after the Closing.

 

6.7 _Required Consents_.

   

 1. Sellers will afford Buyer the opportunity to review, approve and revise the form of each Required Consent or request therefor prior to delivery to the Person whose consent is sought.

 

 2. Following the execution hereof, until the Closing Date (but subject to Section 6.14 if applicable), Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith with Sellers, to obtain all Required Consents. Sellers and Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, within 15 days after the date hereof (subject to extension for a period of up to an additional ten days, if reasonably necessary for a party to complete its application), all applications (including FCC Forms 394 or other appropriate forms, to the extent Sellers determines they are necessary or appropriate) required to be filed with the FCC and any other Governmental Authority that are necessary for the assignment to Buyer of the Governmental Authorizations in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties shall also make appropriate requests, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, for any Required Consent required under any System Contract. Following the execution hereof, until the Closing Date, Sellers shall timely file all required renewal letters with respect to the Franchises pursuant to Section 626(a) of the Cable Act with the proper Governmental Authority. Except as provided in this Section 6.7, including for purposes of satisfaction of the closing condition in Section 7.3, nothing in this Section 6.7 shall require the expenditure or payment of any funds (other than in respect of normal and usual attorneys\' fees, filing fees or other normal costs of doing business) or the giving of any other consideration by Buyer or Sellers in order to obtain the Required Consents, _provided_ that each Seller shall be liable for and timely perform and satisfy all obligations or liabilities under each Governmental Authorization or System Contract of such Seller during the period prior to the Closing Date.

  

 3.   
 1. Buyer and Sellers agree that if, in connection with the process of obtaining any Required Consent, a Governmental Authority or other Person requires the payment of filing fees, consultant fees or other normal and usual fees or costs, Buyer (on the one hand) and the Seller to which such fees or costs relate (on the other hand) will share such fees and costs equally, _provided_ that (i) neither Buyer nor such Seller shall be obligated to pay more than $50,000 in the aggregate in respect thereof, and (ii) in no event will any such fees or costs incurred in connection with the process of obtaining Franchise renewals (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the issuance of any new Franchise in the case where the prior Franchise had already expired) be included or treated as fees or costs incurred in connection with the process of obtaining any Required Consent.

   

 2. Subject to the terms of subsection (i) above, Sellers shall not agree, without Buyer\'s prior written consent, to any adverse change (except nominal monetary amounts) to the terms of any Governmental Authorization or System Contract or the imposition of any condition to the assignment of such Governmental Authorization or System Contract to Buyer as a condition to obtaining any Required Consent. If in connection with the obtaining of any Required Consent, a Governmental Authority or other Person seeks to impose any condition or adverse change to any Governmental Authorization or System Contract to which such Required Consent relates that would be applicable to Buyer as a requirement for granting such Required Consent, Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of such fact. With respect to System Contracts, the Seller which is a party to the System Contract may elect, in its sole discretion, to satisfy any monetary obligation imposed by a contract party by reducing the Purchase Price by the amount thereof, as determined by the mutual agreement of Buyer and such Seller, each acting reasonably. With respect to System Contracts, Buyer will accept and comply with any commercially reasonable non-monetary obligation imposed by a contract party other than a Seller.

  

 4. Buyer shall promptly furnish to any Governmental Authority or other Person from which a Required Consent is requested such accurate and complete information regarding Buyer, including financial information relating to the cable and other media operations of Buyer, as such Governmental Authority or other Person may reasonably require in connection with obtaining any Required Consent.

  

6.8 _Tax Matters_.

   

 1. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest), incurred in connection with the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the Assets conveyed by a Seller other than income or similar Taxes (" _Sales Taxes_ ") shall be shared equally by Buyer (on the one hand) and such Seller (on the other hand), except that such Seller shall be solely responsible for the payment of any Sales Taxes incurred as a result of the transfer of assets, properties, rights or interest to such Seller by its Affiliates pursuant to Section 6.9(b) or 6.19. Buyer and Sellers will cooperate in all reasonable respects to prepare and file all necessary federal, state and local tax returns, tax information returns, reports and estimates and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, subject to the provisions of Section 6.8(b).

 

 2. Tax returns required to be filed in respect of Sales Taxes (" _Sales Tax Returns_ ") will be prepared and filed by the party that has primary responsibility under applicable law for filing such Sales Tax Returns. If no party has primary responsibility under applicable law for filing a Sales Tax Return, then Sellers will be responsible for preparing and filing any such Sales Tax Return. Sellers will comply with all state notification requirements and timely file in proper form with any applicable taxing authority any notice provided for under applicable state or local laws to confirm that Tax liabilities (other than Sales Taxes) of any Seller for the period ending on or prior to the Closing Date will not be assumed by Buyer. Each Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing, a written confirmation from the applicable Taxing authorities of such Seller in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New York and West Virginia and Florida, that all state Tax reports have been filed by such Seller and all state Taxes (other than Sales Taxes) and unemployment compensation contributions have been paid by such Seller through the Closing Date and a similar written confirmation from any local taxing authority with respect to local Taxes (other than Sales Taxes) to the extent available from such local taxing authority. 

  

6.9 _Further Assurances; Satisfaction of Covenants, etc._

  

 

(a) Sellers and Buyer each shall execute such documents and other papers and
take or cause to be taken such further action as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Seller and Buyer shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy each of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement
and to satisfy each condition to Closing it is required to satisfy hereunder.

 

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, but in any event prior to the transfer of the
Assets to Buyer at the Closing, Sellers shall cause all Assets that are owned
by Affiliates of the Sellers and leased to, used by, held for use by or useful
principally in connection with the operation of the System to be transferred
and assigned to one or more of the Sellers free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than Permitted Encumbrances. Sellers and their Affiliates shall be
solely responsible for all costs and expenses (including Sales Taxes) incurred
in connection with the transfers and assignments contemplated by this Section
6.9(b).

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer and its
representatives and advisors in connection with Buyer\'s efforts to discuss
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement with the labor unions which
are party to the collective bargaining agreements identified on _Schedule
4.11_.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and each Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any retransmission consent to which such Seller is
a party and which relate to stations serving an area covered by the System
that is assignable to be assigned to Buyer at the Closing.

  

6.10 _Noncompetition Agreement_.

 

Each Seller agrees that, prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date
it will not, and will not cause or permit Charter Communications, Inc. or any
controlled Affiliate of Charter Communications, Inc. to, without the written
consent of Buyer, own or operate or otherwise engage in a Competitive Business
within any Franchise Area, or solicit for employment or employ any Transferred
Employee or other employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ that
this Section 6.10 shall not prohibit a solicitation for employment in a
general solicitation that is not directed at employees of Buyer or any
resulting employment, or any solicitation or employment of any individual
whose employment by Buyer or the applicable Affiliate ceased greater than 180
days prior to such solicitation or employment. A " _Competitive Business_ "
means any cable television, multichannel multipoint distribution system,
direct broadcast satellite, satellite master antenna television or other
multi-channel video signal distribution business, high speed data business or
residential telephony business.

 

6.11 _Title Commitments and Surveys_.

 

Buyer will have the option to obtain, at its own expense, commitments to issue
title insurance policies and surveys with respect to the Real Property.
Sellers shall deliver such reasonable affidavits as are required by Buyer\'s
title company in order to delete the standard printed exceptions relating to
mechanics liens and the interests of other parties in possession and shall
provide such access to the Real Property as is reasonably required to permit
Buyer to obtain surveys thereof.

 

6.12 _Risk of Loss_.

 

The risk of any loss or damage to the System and the Assets resulting from
fire, theft or other casualty (except reasonable wear and tear) will be borne
by the Seller which owns the applicable portion of the System and Assets at
all times prior to the Closing. If any such loss or damage is sufficiently
substantial so as to preclude and prevent resumption of normal operations of
any material portion of the System, Sellers will promptly notify Buyer in
writing of that fact and whether Sellers will repair, replace and restore the
lost or damaged property to its former condition as soon as practicable at
their sole expense. If Sellers indicate that they will not so repair, replace
and restore the lost or damaged property, then Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to Sellers within
thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice from Sellers. If Sellers agree
to so repair, replace and restore the lost or damaged property, then this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and Sellers shall be
obligated to effect such repair, replacement and restoration as soon as
reasonably practicable; _provided_ , however, that if such repair, replacement
or restoration cannot reasonably be completed in all material respects prior
to the Closing, then (i) the Closing shall be delayed until such completion in
all material respects occurs, and (ii) at Buyer\'s option the Outside Closing
Date shall be extended to allow Sellers to complete such repair, replacement
or restoration, but in no event shall the Outside Closing Date be extended by
more than one month.

 

6.13 _Retention of Books and Records_.

 

Following the Closing, each Seller shall provide reasonable access to Buyer
and its counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives during
normal business hours to such Seller\'s materials, books, records and
documents that relate to the operations of the System prior to the Closing
Date and are not included in the Assets as may be reasonably necessary in
connection with any legitimate business purpose (including the preparation of
tax reports and returns, the preparation of financial statements and the
preparation of regulatory reports and filings). Such access will be subject to
the generally applicable document retention policies of the applicable Seller
(provided they are not in conflict with any other provision of this
Agreement), shall be subject to reasonable advance written notice (not to
exceed two (2) Business Days), will be conducted in a manner that is not
disruptive to such Seller\'s business in any material respect, and will be
subject to any other reasonable limitations, including confidentiality
restrictions imposed by the applicable Seller.

 

6.14 _Franchise Consents and Real Property Title_.

 

(a) If, by the date that all conditions contained in Sections 7 and 8 have
been satisfied or waived, (i) Sellers shall have obtained Required Consents to
transfer to Buyer Franchises covering at least 90% of the System\'s
subscribers to Basic Cable Service, including the Franchise set forth on
_Schedule 6.14(a)_ , but less than 100% of the System\'s subscribers to Basic
Cable Service, and (ii) the Franchises for which Required Consents have not
been obtained do not, and applicable Legal Requirements do not, in the
reasonable judgment of Buyer prohibit the actions contemplated by this Section
6.14(a), then the parties shall consummate the Closing in accordance with the
following:

 

(i) Subject to Section 6.14(b), the Closing shall occur with respect to, and
Sellers shall transfer, convey and assign to Buyer (the " _Primary Consent
Transfer_ "), all Assets other than any Franchises for which Required Consents
have not been obtained (such excepted Franchises being the " _Retained Consent
Franchises_ "), and the amount of the Purchase Price paid to Sellers at the
Closing shall be reduced by $3,255 for each Equivalent Basic Subscriber
covered by a Retained Consent Franchise.

 

(ii) Following the closing of the Primary Consent Transfer, the parties shall
continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Required Consents
for any Retained Consent Franchises in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. As soon as practicable after obtaining a Required Consent for a
Retained Consent Franchise, but subject to Section 6.14(b), Sellers shall
transfer, convey and assign such Retained Consent Franchise to the Buyer (such
transfer being a " _Subsequent Consent Transfer_ ") free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and Buyer shall pay to
Sellers, as the purchase price for such Retained Consent Franchise, an amount
equal to $3,255 for each Equivalent Basic Subscriber covered by the Retained
Consent Franchise being transferred, but in no event shall the aggregate
purchase price for Retained Consent Franchises included in Subsequent Consent
Transfers be greater than the aggregate amount by which the Purchase Price
paid to Sellers at the Closing was reduced pursuant to Section 6.14(a)(i). The
closing conditions set forth in Section 7 shall apply to any Subsequent
Consent Transfer of a Retained Consent Franchise insofar as such conditions
relate to the Retained Consent Franchise in question. If the parties are
unable to obtain the Required Consent for any Retained Consent Franchise
within six (6) months after the Closing Date, then, unless the parties shall
otherwise agree in writing, Buyer\'s obligation to consummate a Subsequent
Consent Transfer with respect to such Retained Consent Franchise shall
terminate, Sellers shall retain such Retained Consent Franchise and the
reduction of the Purchase Price for the Retained Consent Franchise shall be
final.

 

(iii) Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement prior
to the Closing on a management agreement pursuant to which Buyer will manage
all Retained Consent Franchises, which management agreement shall also contain
any required signal sharing arrangements (the " _Retained Franchise Management
Agreement_ "). The Retained Franchise Management Agreement shall provide that:
(x) Buyer will bear all expenses relating to the Retained Consent Franchises
and the operation thereof and will receive the net cash flow from the Retained
Consent Franchises as its management fee; (y) Sellers will indemnify, defend
and hold Buyer harmless from any Claims related to defending any challenges
raised with respect to a Retained Consent Franchise or the transactions
described in this Section 6.14(a) as applied to such Retained Consent
Franchise; and (z) its term will continue with respect to each Retained
Consent Franchise until there is a Subsequent Consent Transfer of such
Retained Consent Franchise, or such Retained Consent Franchise is revoked as a
result of the transactions described in this Section 6.14(a)(iii), or a court
orders the termination of the Retained Franchise Management Agreement with
respect to such Retained Consent Franchise or Buyer\'s obligation to
consummate a Subsequent Consent Transfer ceases pursuant to Section
6.14(a)(ii).

 

(iv) If the provisions of this Section 6.14(a) become operative, the parties
agree to use commercially reasonable efforts and act in good faith in taking
such actions and negotiating such additional provisions or other agreements,
including amendments to this Agreement, as may be necessary or appropriate to
carry out the intent of this Section 6.14(a).

 

(b) If, by the date that all conditions contained in Sections 7 and 8 have
been satisfied or waived, (i) Sellers have not obtained good, marketable and
insurable fee simple interests in the Owned Real Property on which cable
system headends are located as set forth on _Schedule 6.14(b)_ (" _Headend
Real Property_ "), and (ii) the Franchises which are served by Headend Real
Property for which good, marketable and insurable fee simple interests have
not been obtained do not, and applicable Legal Requirements do not, in the
reasonable judgment of Buyer prohibit the actions contemplated by this Section
6.14(b), then the parties shall consummate the Closing in accordance with the
following:

 

(i) The Closing shall occur with respect to, and Sellers shall transfer,
convey and assign to Buyer (the " _Primary Property Transfer_ "), all Assets
other than any Headend Real Property for which good, marketable and insurable
fee simple interests have not been obtained and, subject to Section 6.14(a),
any Franchises which are served by such Headend Real Property (such excepted
Franchises being the " _Retained Property Franchises_ "), and the amount of
the Purchase Price paid to Sellers at the Closing shall be reduced by $3,255
for each Equivalent Basic Subscriber covered by a Retained Property Franchise.

 

(ii) Following the closing of the Primary Property Transfer, the parties shall
continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain good, marketable and
insurable fee simple interests in the Headend Real Property. As soon as
practicable after obtaining good, marketable and insurable fee simple interest
for a Headend Real Property, but subject to Section 6.14(a), Sellers shall
transfer, convey and assign such Head Retained Property and associated
Retained Property Franchises to the Buyer (such transfer being a " _Subsequent
Property Transfer_ ") free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances, and Buyer shall pay to Sellers, as the purchase price for such
Headend Real Property and Retained Property Franchises, an amount equal to
$3,255 for each Equivalent Basic Subscriber covered by the Retained Property
Franchises being transferred, but in no event shall the aggregate purchase
price for Headend Real Property and Retained Property Franchises included in
Subsequent Property Transfers be greater than the aggregate amount by which
the Purchase Price paid to Sellers at the Closing was reduced pursuant to
Section 6.14(b)(i). The closing conditions set forth in Section 7 shall apply
to any Subsequent Property Transfer insofar as such conditions relate to the
Headend Real Property and Retained Property Franchises in question. If the
parties are unable to obtain good, marketable and insurable fee simple
interest on any Headend Real Property within six (6) months after the Closing
Date, then, unless the parties shall otherwise agree in writing, Buyer\'s
obligation to consummate a Subsequent Property Transfer with respect to the
Headend Real Property shall terminate, Sellers shall retain such Headend Real
Property and associated Retained Property Franchises and the reduction of the
Purchase Price for the Headend Real Property and Retained Property Franchises
shall be final. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the Closing
and prior to six (6) months after the Closing Date (or any time thereafter as
Buyer and Sellers may agree), Buyer shall have the right to elect to
consummate a Subsequent Property Transfer, even if good, marketable and
insurable fee simple interest on the Headend Real Property associated with
such Subsequent Property Transfer has not been obtained, provided that in such
event the applicable Seller shall quitclaim such Headend Real Property to
Buyer subject to all imperfections of title.

 

(iii) Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement prior
to the Closing on a management agreement pursuant to which Buyer will manage
all Headend Real Property and Retained Property Franchises, which management
agreement shall also contain any required signal sharing arrangements (the "
_Retained Property Management Agreement_ "). The Retained Property Management
Agreement shall provide that: (i) Buyer will bear all expenses relating to the
Headend Real Property and Retained Property Franchises and the operation
thereof and will receive the net cash flow from the Retained Property
Franchises as its management fee; (ii) Sellers will indemnify, defend and hold
Buyer harmless from any Claims related to defending any challenges raised with
respect to a Headend Real Property, a Retained Property Franchise or the
transactions described in this Section 6.14(b) as applied to such Headend Real
Property and Retained Property Franchise; (iii) Buyer will have a valid
leasehold interest in each Headend Real Property and will have full possession
of such property (subject to Permitted Encumbrances) and the full right to use
such property for purposes of conducting the business of the System without
the payment of any rent (but subject to the expense arrangement described in
the preceding clause (i)); and (iv) its term will continue with respect to
each Headend Real Property and Retained Property Franchise until there is a
Subsequent Property Transfer of such Headend Real Property and Retained
Property Franchise, or such Retained Property Franchise is revoked as a result
of the transactions described in this Section 6.14(b)(iii), or a court orders
the termination of the Retained Property Management Agreement with respect to
such Headend Real Property and Retained Property Franchise or Buyer\'s
obligation to consummate a Subsequent Property Transfer ceases pursuant to
Section 6.14(b)(ii).

 

(iv) If the provisions of this Section 6.14(b) become operative, the parties
agree to use commercially reasonable efforts and act in good faith in taking
such actions and negotiating such additional provisions or other agreements,
including amendments to this Agreement, as may be necessary or appropriate to
carry out the intent of this Section 6.14(b).

 

6.15 _Estoppel Certificates_. Prior to the Closing, each Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain estoppel certificates with respect
to each Real Property Lease of such Seller in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and its lenders.

 

6.16 _Transition Services_. Sellers will provide to Buyer in connection with
the System, for a period of one year following the Closing (subject to earlier
termination at Buyer\'s election with respect to any Transition Service),
transition services to allow for the conversion of existing call center,
billing system, and all internet support services, including access to and the
right to use its billing system, call center, internet addresses, software,
internet back bone connection, email servers and related fixed assets,
financial reporting services and vehicle fleet/inventory management and
maintenance services (the " _Transition Services_ "). Sellers and Buyer will
negotiate in good faith to reach agreement within sixty (60) days after
execution of this Agreement to enter into a transition services agreement (the
" _Transition Services Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Sellers will provide
the Transition Services and any other services agreed to by both parties. The
Transition Services Agreement shall provide that: (a) the Transition Services
provided to Buyer for a period of six months following the Closing Date will
be provided to Buyer at the lower of: (i) Sellers\' actual cost, or (ii) the
cost of such Transition Services allocated by Sellers\' Affiliates to Sellers
in a manner consistent with past practice (such lower amount being the "Cost-
Based Fee"); and (b) any Transition Services provided to Buyer after such
6-month period will be provided to Buyer at the Cost-Based Fee plus an
additional fee amount to be set forth in the Transition Services Agreement.
Within 30 days after execution of this Agreement, Sellers shall identify all
such services provided by any Person other than Sellers for the System and
Buyer may then opt to include these services as Transition Services in the
Transition Services Agreement. Based on Sellers\' representations to Buyer,
Buyer acknowledges that in order for Buyer to obtain billing-related
Transition Services, Buyer would be required on the Closing Date to execute an
Interim Letter Agreement with CSG System, Inc. substantially in the form
previously provided to Buyer, _provided_ it is understood that Buyer is not
obligated under this Agreement to enter into an Interim Letter Agreement.

 

6.17 _No Shop_.

 

None of any Seller, Charter Communications, Inc., or any of their respective
controlled Affiliates, partners or officers or any agent or representative of
any of them will, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement
and ending with the earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit or initiate the submission of
proposals or offers from any Person for, participate in any discussions
pertaining to, or furnish any information to any Person other than Buyer
relating to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of all or any
portion of the Assets or (b) furnish confidential information about the System
to any party other than Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the
possible sale of the System or any of the Assets to any party other than Buyer
or its Affiliates.

 

6.18 _Delivery of Due Diligence_. Sellers will deliver or make available to
Buyer at the offices of the System reasonably promptly after the date hereof
the additional regulatory due diligence materials set forth on _Schedule 6.18_
(the "Additional Regulatory Diligence Material"). Additional Regulatory
Diligence Material that Sellers intend to deliver to Buyer (rather than make
such materials available at the offices of the System) must be delivered to
Buyer on or prior to September 23, 2003. All other Additional Regulatory
Diligence Material shall be made available at the offices of the System, and
in order for Buyer to conduct its review of such Additional Regulatory
Diligence Material, each Seller shall afford to Buyer or authorized
representatives and advisors of Buyer (including Buyer\'s prospective
financing sources and their respective representatives and advisors)
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices and properties
of the System where such Additional Regulatory Diligence Material is
maintained, shall make available to the foregoing Persons knowledgeable
personnel of the System, and shall use its best efforts to schedule any site
visits requested by the foregoing Persons on the dates and at the times
requested by Buyer, which shall be as soon as reasonably practicable and no
later than October 14, 2003. If the Additional Regulatory Diligence Material
indicates that following the Closing, Buyer or its Affiliates (as operators of
the System) will incur or be obligated to pay additional operating expenses,
capital expenditures or other reasonable out of pocket costs or expenses in
excess of $250,000 in the aggregate, Buyer shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement by delivering written notice thereof to Sellers on or prior to
the earlier of (i) October 21, 2003, and (ii) the fifth Business Day after the
date of the final site visit conducted pursuant to the second sentence of this
Section 6.18. Sellers will deliver or make available to Buyer reasonably
promptly after the date hereof, but in no event later than September 30, 2003,
the diligence materials set forth on _Schedule 6.18A_ , but such materials do
not constitute Additional Regulatory Diligence Material.

 

6.19 _Inter-Affiliate Transfer of Assets_. Prior to the Closing, any Seller
may transfer any of its Assets to any Affiliate of any Seller in accordance
with this Section 6.19 (an "Inter-Affiliate Transfer"). In the event of an
Inter-Affiliate Transfer, Buyer and Sellers shall enter into an amendment to
this Agreement to add any such Affiliate that is the recipient of Assets
pursuant to an Inter-Affiliate Transfer as an additional Seller to this
Agreement; such Affiliate shall be obligated to transfer to Buyer at the
Closing the Assets which were the subject of the Inter-Affiliate Transfer on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and shall otherwise have
the rights and obligations of a Seller under this Agreement. Sellers and their
Affiliates shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses (including
Sales Taxes) incurred in connection with the transfers and assignments
contemplated by this Section 6.19.

 

6.20 _Pre-Closing Letter of Credit_. Upon expiration of Buyer\'s right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.2(c),
Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an irrevocable stand-by letter of
credit in the face amount of Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) on
standard commercial terms in a form and from a bank or financial institution
reasonably acceptable to Sellers naming the Escrow Agent identified in the
Letter of Credit Escrow Agreement as the beneficiary (" _Pre-Closing Letter of
Credit_ ") to secure, in part, Buyer\'s obligations hereunder. Such Pre-
Closing Letter of Credit will serve as a substitute for the Pre-Closing
Deposit.

 

6.21 _EBS Percentage Amendment_. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that Sellers
desire that the term "EBS Percentage" be amended prior to the Closing to the
extent required such that the Sellers\' respective EBS Percentages reflect the
relative fair market value of Equivalent Basic Subscribers located within the
various Franchise Areas included in the System, as jointly determined by Buyer
and Sellers with the assistance of Daniels and Associates, Inc. ("Daniels"). Any
out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with such
determination (including any valuation, banking or other fees charged by
Daniels) shall be borne solely by Sellers. Accordingly, promptly after the
date of this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers in good faith shall endeavor to
negotiate, execute and deliver a mutually satisfactory amendment to Section
1.1 of this Agreement solely for the purpose of amending the definition of
"EBS Percentage" so as to reflect this principle.

  

7\. _Conditions Precedent To Buyer\'s Obligations_.

prevent the entry of any such judgment, decree, order or other legal

(b) each of the other representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in
Section 5 shall be true and correct in all respects at and as of the time of
the Closing as though made at and as of that time; _provided_ that, for
purposes of each of clauses (a) and (b) above, such representations and
warranties shall be deemed true and correct in all respects to the extent
that, after removing concepts of material adverse effect or materiality from
all such individual representations and warranties, the aggregate effect of
any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties as of the applicable
times does not reflect a material adverse change in Buyer\'s ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  

8.2 _Covenants._

 

Buyer shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all
covenants and agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by Buyer prior to or at the Closing.

 

8.3 _Judgment_.

 

There shall not be in effect on the date on which the Closing is to occur any
judgment, decree, order or other prohibition having the force of law that
would prevent or make unlawful the Closing, nor shall any action or other
proceeding that reasonably could be expected to result in any such judgment,
decree, order or other prohibition be pending or overtly threatened;
_provided_ that Sellers shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent the entry of any such judgment, decree, order or other legal
prohibition and to appeal as expeditiously as possible any such judgment,
decree, order or other legal prohibition that may be entered.

 

8.4 _Retained Franchise Management Agreement_.

 

If Section 6.14 applies, the parties shall have reached agreement on the
Retained Franchise Management Agreement.

 2. the Bill of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and any document described in Section 7.11(c) that, by its terms or in order to be effective, must be executed by Buyer, each duly executed by Buyer;

 

 3. the Transition Services Agreement, the Post-Closing Escrow Agreement and, if Section 6.14 applies, the Retained Franchise Management Agreement, each duly executed by Buyer;

 5. resale certificates with respect to applicable sales and use Tax exemptions as reasonably requested by Sellers relating to Assets to be re-sold by Buyer after Closing; and

 

 6. all other documents as are reasonably necessary to effect the intent of this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

9\. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

 

The representations, warranties and certifications of the parties made or
provided for in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the later of
the first anniversary of the Closing Date and March 31, 2005, except the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.2, 4.19, 4.16 and 4.22,
the first sentence of Section 4.7(d), and Section 4.8(a), and certifications
thereof, shall survive the Closing for the duration of the applicable statute
of limitations (the " _Indemnity Period_ "). No claim for indemnification for
breach of a representation or warranty or any related certification may be
asserted after the expiration of the applicable Indemnity Period; _provided_
that the written assertion of any claim by a party against the other(s)
hereunder with respect to the breach or alleged breach of any representation,
warranty or certification (or of a series of facts which would support such
breach) shall extend the Indemnity Period with respect to such claim through
the date such claim is conclusively resolved.

 

10\. _Indemnification_.

 

  

10.1 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, Buyer agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Sellers, after the Closing, from and against any and
all Claims (as defined herein) to the extent such Claims are based upon, arise
out of or are related to (i) a breach of any representation or warranty or any
related certification described in Section 8.8(a), or any failure to perform
or comply with any of the covenants, conditions or agreements, of Buyer set
forth in this Agreement or in any Related Agreement, (ii) the assertion of any
Claim or any legal action against Sellers by any Governmental Authority or
other Person based upon, arising out of or relating to the ownership or
operation of the Assets or the System to the extent occurring, arising or
accruing after the Closing Date (other than as a result of facts or
circumstances giving rise to a Claim described in Section 10.2), or (iii) the
Assumed Liabilities.

 

10.2 _Indemnification by Parent and Sellers_.

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, each Seller severally, and
not jointly, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, after the
Closing, from and against any and all Claims to the extent such Claims are
based upon, arise out of or relate to (i) a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement or any related certification thereof
delivered pursuant hereto, or any failure to perform or comply with any of the
covenants, conditions or agreements, of such Seller set forth in this
Agreement or in any Related Agreement, (ii) any Claim or legal action against
Buyer by any Governmental Authority or other Person based upon, arising out of
or relating to the ownership or operation of the Assets, the Real Property or
the System attributable to such Seller to the extent such Claim or legal
action relates to or arises from facts, events or conditions existing or
occurring prior to the Closing including the ownership or operation by such
Seller of the Assets, the Real Property or the System prior to the Closing
(other than to the extent such Claim or legal action is an Assumed Liability
or is an Environmental Claim based upon, arising out of or relating to the
ownership or operation of the Assets or the System prior to the Start Date (a
"Pre-Start Date Environmental Claim")), (iii) any Retained Liability of such
Seller (other than a Retained Liability to the extent arising out of a Pre-
Start Date Environmental Claim), or (iv) the determination of the EBS
Percentages pursuant to Section 6.21. To the extent that any Claim for which
Buyer is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10.2(a) is not readily
attributable to a particular Seller, each Seller shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer with respect to such Claim, but only to the extent of such
Seller\'s EBS Percentage of such Claim.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, Parent agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer, after the Closing, from and against any and
all Claims to the extent such Claims are based upon, arise out of or relate to
(i) a breach of any representation or warranty or any related certification
thereof delivered pursuant hereto, or any failure to perform or comply with
any of the covenants, conditions or agreements, of any Seller or Parent set
forth in this Agreement or in any Related Agreement, (ii) any Claim or legal
action against Buyer by any Governmental Authority or other Person based upon,
arising out of or relating to the ownership or operation of the Assets, the
Real Property or the System to the extent such Claim or legal action relates
to or arises from facts, events or conditions existing or occurring prior to
the Closing including the ownership or operation of the Assets, the Real
Property or the System prior to the Closing (other than to the extent such
Claim or legal action is an Assumed Liability or is a Pre-Start Date
Environmental Claim), (iii) any Retained Liability (other than a Retained
Liability to the extent arising out of a Pre-Start Date Environmental Claim)
or (iv) the determination of the EBS Percentages pursuant to Section 6.21.

 

10.3 _Assertion of Claims_.

   

 1. If Buyer or any Seller believes that it has a claim for indemnification, it shall notify the other promptly in writing describing such claim with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement under which such claim has arisen. The omission by a party to so notify promptly any other party shall not relieve such other party from any liability which it may have to the first party in connection therewith, except to the extent such other party actually has been prejudiced by such failure to give notice.

 

 2. As used in this Section 10, the word " _Claim_ " shall mean any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, deficiencies, demands, claims, fines, penalties, interest, assessments, judgments, actions, proceedings and suits of whatever kind and nature and all costs and expenses relating thereto (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees incurred in connection with the investigation or defense thereof or in asserting rights hereunder).

 

 3. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any third party beneficiary rights, including but not limited to any extension of any statute of limitations pertaining to suits, actions or proceedings brought by third parties.

  

10.4 _Notice of and Right to Defend Third Party Claims_.

 

Promptly upon receipt of notice of any Claim or the commencement of any suit,
action or proceeding by a third party in respect of which indemnification may
be sought on account of an indemnity agreement contained in Section 10.1 or
10.2, the party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnitee_ ") shall give
notice in writing to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnitor_ "). The omission by such Indemnitee to so notify promptly such
Indemnitor of any such Claim or action shall not relieve such Indemnitor from
any liability which it may have to such Indemnitee in connection therewith. In
case any Claim shall be asserted or any suit, action or proceeding commenced
against an Indemnitee, the Indemnitor will be entitled to participate therein,
and, to the extent that it may wish, subject to Indemnitor\'s written
confirmation of its indemnity obligations hereunder with respect to such
Claim, to assume the defense or conduct the settlement thereof with legal
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ that the
Indemnitor will not be entitled to assume such defense or conduct such
settlement if the claimant seeks a remedy other than the payment of money
damages or if the Claim relates to a Franchise. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to settle any
such suit, action or proceeding without the Indemnitee\'s consent, which
consent may be withheld in the Indemnitee\'s sole discretion if such
settlement would impose a monetary obligation on the Indemnitee or if
compliance with such settlement would require the Indemnitee to expend more
than a nominal amount, and in any other event shall not be unreasonably
withheld. After notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee of its election
so to assume the defense, conduct or settlement thereof (along with its
written confirmation of its indemnity obligations), the Indemnitor will not be
liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnitee to employ separate counsel in connection with the defense,
conduct or settlement thereof following such notice. The Indemnitee will
reasonably cooperate (at the Indemnitor\'s expense) with the Indemnitor in
connection with any such claim assumed by the Indemnitor to make available to
the Indemnitor all Persons and all pertinent information under the
Indemnitee\'s control.

 

10.5 _Limitations of Liability_.

   

 1. The amount of any Claim indemnifiable by an Indemnitor pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2 shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds resulting from the subject matter of such claim actually received by the Indemnitee in respect of such claim (net of any resulting increase in insurance premiums and any expenditures made in connection with obtaining such insurance recovery).

 

 2. Neither Parent nor any Seller shall be required to indemnify Buyer under Section 10.2 with respect to Claims arising out of any breach of any representation and warranty of any Seller contained in this Agreement or any certificate thereof delivered pursuant hereto, and Buyer shall not be required to indemnify Sellers under Section 10.1 with respect to Claims arising out of any breach of any representation and warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any certificate thereof delivered pursuant hereto, until the aggregate amount of all such Claims against Parent and the Sellers, or against Buyer, as the case may be, exceeds $250,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), in which case the indemnifying party or parties shall only be liable for the amount of all Claims in excess of the Indemnification Threshold.

 

 3. From and after the Closing, Parent\'s and Sellers\' collective aggregate liability to Buyer for Claims arising from this Agreement shall be limited to $10,000,000; _provided_ , however, that such limitation shall not be applicable to: (i) Claims arising from any Retained Liabilities or any liabilities arising from or relating to the determination of the EBS Percentages pursuant to Section 6.2; (ii) any breach of any representation and warranty of any Seller in Section 4.2, 4.19, 4.16 or 4.22, the first sentence of Section 4.7(d), Section 4.8(a), or any certification thereof; (iii) the breach of any representation and warranty of the Parent contained herein or in any certification thereof; and (iv) any breach by any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller of Section 6.9(b), 6.10 or any other covenant required to be performed after the Closing. From and after the Closing, Buyer\'s liability to Sellers for Claims arising out of this Agreement shall be limited to $10,000,000; _provided,_ however, that such limitation shall not be applicable to: (i) Claims arising from any Assumed Liabilities; and (ii) any breach by Buyer of any covenant required to be performed after the Closing.

  

 4. From and after the Closing, each Seller\'s individual aggregate liability to Buyer for Claims arising from this Agreement shall be limited to the product of such Seller\'s EBS Percentage multiplied by $10,000,000; _provided_ , however, that such limitation shall not be applicable to: (i) Claims arising from any Retained Liabilities or any liabilities arising from or relating to the determination of the EBS Percentages pursuant to Section 6.2; (ii) any breach of any representation and warranty of such Seller in Section 4.2, 4.19, 4.16 or 4.22, the first sentence of Section 4.7(d), Section 4.8(a), or any certification thereof; and (iii) any breach by such Seller or any Affiliate of such Seller of Section 6.9(b), 6.10 or any other covenant required to be performed after the Closing. 

 

10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_.

  

After the Closing, the remedies provided for in this Section 10 shall be
exclusive and shall be in lieu of all other remedies for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision of this
Agreement (other than any breach that was fraudulent or intentional);
_provided_ , however, that this sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any
party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief.

  

11\. _Termination_.

 

  

11.1 _Termination_.

  

This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing only in accordance with
the following:

 

(a) At any time by mutual consent of each Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) By Sellers (acting unanimously) or by Buyer if the Closing hereunder has
not taken place on or before the Outside Closing Date other than by reason of
a breach or default of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement by the party(ies) seeking to terminate; _provided_ that such parties
may mutually agree to extend such date if as of such date the conditions to
Closing set forth have not been satisfied;

 

(c) By Sellers (acting unanimously) or by Buyer, at any time, if the other
party is in material breach or material default of its covenants and
agreements under this Agreement and the party(ies) in breach or default does
not cure such breach or default within 30 days after written notice thereof is
delivered to the non-terminating party, _provided_ that Buyer is not (in the
case of a termination by Buyer) or no Seller is (in the case of a termination
by Sellers) in material breach or material default hereunder;

 

(d) By Sellers (acting unanimously) or by Buyer, if the representations and
warranties of the other party(ies) are not true and correct in all respects
(or, with respect to representations and warranties made as of a specific
date, are not true and correct in all respects as of such date), and such
failure is not cured (i) within 60 days after written notice thereof is
delivered to the non-terminating party(ies), or (ii) by the Outside Closing
Date, whichever of (i) or (ii) is earlier; _provided_ that all of the
representations and warranties of the terminating party(ies) are true and
correct in all respects; and _provided_ , further, that for purposes of this
Section 11.1(d), the representations and warranties of a party (or in the case
of Sellers, all Sellers) shall be deemed true and correct in all respects to
the extent that, after removing concepts of Material Adverse Effect or
materiality from all such individual representations and warranties, the
aggregate effect of any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties as
of the applicable times does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect; and

 

(e) By Buyer, in accordance with Section 6.2(c), 6.12 or 6.18.

 

11.2 _Surviving Obligations_.

 

In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Buyer or Sellers
pursuant to this Section 11, prompt written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party(ies), and this Agreement shall terminate without further
action by any of the parties hereto. In such event, no party shall have any
further obligation or liability to any other party pursuant to or by reason of
this Agreement, except for such party\'s obligations set forth in Sections
4.22, 5.5, 6.4, 11.3, 11.4, 12, 20 and (with respect to any Section identified
in this proviso) 21 or, subject to Section 11.3(a), any breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination.

 

11.3 _Liquidated Damages_.

 

(a) If Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(c) or
11.1(d), then Buyer shall be liable to Sellers in an amount equal to
$25,000,000; _provided_ that, if Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to
either such Section and an Intentional Failure to Close (as defined below) has
occurred, then, in lieu of receiving such amount, Sellers (acting unanimously)
may elect to (i) receive a payment in the amount of $5,000,000 and (ii)
recover from Buyer such actual damages in excess of $5,000,000 to which
Sellers may be entitled. Any election by Sellers described in the proviso to
the preceding sentence (which election shall be irrevocable) shall be stated
in the notice of termination given by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to Section
11.1(c) or 11.1(d), as applicable, and, if such notice does not state whether
Sellers make such election, then Sellers will be deemed irrevocably not to
have made such election. In such event Sellers shall be entitled to receive
either $25,000,000 or $5,000,000 (in either case, the " _Fixed Payment Amount_
") pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 11.3(a), then the Fixed
Payment Amount will be payable from the Pre-Closing Deposit or the proceeds of
a drawing under the Pre-Closing Letter of Credit, as applicable, pursuant to
the Pre-Closing Escrow Agreement or Letter of Credit Escrow Agreement, as
applicable, and, if the Fixed Payment Amount is $5,000,000, then upon the
payment of such amount, the Pre-Closing Letter of Credit will be returned to
Buyer for cancellation (or, as applicable, all other proceeds of any drawing
under the Pre-Closing Escrow Letter of Credit will be disbursed to Buyer).

 

(b) An " _Intentional Failure to Close_ " means that each of the following
statements is true: (i) each of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
Article 7 or Article 8 either has been satisfied or waived in writing or is
not satisfied solely due to a misrepresentation of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement or a breach of this Agreement by Buyer, and (ii) a Financing Source
Failure has not occurred and is not then continuing.

 

(c) A " _Financing Source Failure_ " means any of the following shall have
occurred:

  

(i) the conditions precedent set forth in any Financing Letter shall have been
satisfied but one or more of the financing sources party thereto shall have
failed to perform its funding obligations thereunder;

 

(ii) any condition precedent set forth in any Financing Letter shall not have
been satisfied (other than as a result of any willful misconduct of the Buyer
or its Affiliates); or

 

(iii) any of the Financing Letters shall have been terminated by the
financing source(s) party thereto.

  

(d) If Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(c) or 11.1(d)
and either (i) an Intentional Failure to Close has not occurred, or (ii) an
Intentional Failure to Close has occurred and Sellers do not make the election
described in Section 11.3(a), then the payment to Sellers of the Fixed Payment
Amount shall serve as full liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) under
applicable law, and Buyer shall not have any further liability under this
Agreement (except as provided in Section 11.2). Payment of such liquidated
damages shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy under such
circumstances for each Seller, each of whom shall be deemed to have waived and
released any right to sue Buyer for specific performance of this Agreement or
to recover any damages or other amounts in excess of the Fixed Payment Amount
under such circumstances, except for any breach that occurs after the date of
the termination of this Agreement of any provision of this Agreement that
survives the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 11.2.

 

(e) If this Agreement terminates other than under the circumstances described
in Sections 11.3(a) through 11.3(d), then Buyer and Sellers will take such
action as may be required to cause the Escrow Agent under the Pre-Closing
Escrow Agreement or Letter of Credit Escrow Agreement, as applicable, to
release the Pre-Closing Deposit or the Pre-Closing Letter of Credit, as
applicable, to Buyer.

 

11.4 _Attorney\'s Fees_.

 

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement that may limit or qualify a
party\'s remedies, but subject to the limitation set forth in Section 11.3(a),
in the event of a default by any party that results in a lawsuit or other
proceeding for any remedy available under this Agreement, the prevailing party
shall be entitled to reimbursement from the defaulting party of its reasonable
legal fees and expenses.

 

12\. _Expenses_.

 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party shall pay its own
expenses incurred in connection with the authorization, preparation, execution
and performance of this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, agents and other representatives.

 

13\. _Entire Agreement_.

 

Buyer and Sellers agree that this Agreement, including the Schedules and all
Exhibits hereto and any other written document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith, including the Related Agreements, constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior understandings and agreements with respect thereto.

 

14\. _Parties Obligated and Benefited_.

 

Subject to the limitations set forth below, this Agreement will be binding
upon the parties and their respective assigns and successors in interest and
will inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their respective assigns
and successors in interest, and no other Person will be entitled to any of the
benefits conferred by this Agreement. Without the prior written consent of the
other parties, no party will assign any of its rights under this Agreement or
delegate any of its duties under this Agreement; _provided_ that no such
consent of Sellers will be required with respect to any assignment by Buyer
(a) to an Affiliate of Buyer or for collateral purposes, at any time, or (b)
to any Person, after the Closing. No assignment (whether or not the preceding
sentence requires the consent of the other party(ies) thereto) will release
the assigning party from any liability or obligation under this Agreement.

 

15\. _Notices_.

 

All notices, requests, consents, and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by first-class
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, by

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, any term of this
Agreement may be amended and the observance of any term of this Agreement may
be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either
retroactively or prospectively), only with the written consent of Sellers and
Buyer. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 16
shall be binding upon each party. No waivers of or exceptions to any term,

term, condition or provision.

 

17\. _Severability._

  

If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or deemed to be, or shall in
fact be, invalid, inoperative or unenforceable because of the conflict of such
provision with any constitution or statute or rule of public policy or for any
other reason, such circumstance shall not have the effect of rendering any
other provision or provisions herein contained invalid, inoperative or
unenforceable, but this Agreement shall be reformed and construed as if such
invalid, inoperative or unenforceable provision had never been contained
herein and such provision reformed so that it would be valid, operative and
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted.

 

18\. _Section Headings and Terms_.

 

The section headings in this Agreement are for convenience and reference
purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever required by the context, the singular will include
the plural and the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender will include all
genders. Neither the term "including\' nor any derivative thereof is used in
this Agreement to signify any limitation to any item or items specified in
connection therewith, whether or not such term or derivative is accompanied by
words such as "without limitation" or "but not limited to." All accounting
determinations pursuant to this Agreement (including the amounts of the
Adjustment Assets and Adjustment Liabilities) will be made in accordance with
the accounting policies and practices employed by Sellers in the preparation
of the unaudited financial statements as of June 30, 2003 and for the six-
month period then ended that are part of _Schedule 4.5_, to the extent that
such policies and practices are consistent with GAAP, and otherwise in
accordance with GAAP, to the extent such accounting policies and procedures
are not consistent with GAAP; _provided_ that all known errors and adjustments
of the type required in a year-end closing of the books will be made.

 

19\. _Counterparts_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument, and shall become effective when counterparts which
together contain the signatures of each party hereto shall have been delivered
to Sellers and Buyer.

 

20\. _Governing Law_.

 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the law (without giving effect to the law governing the principles of
conflicts of law) of the State of Delaware.

 

21\. _Specific Performance_.

 

Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.3, the parties hereto
acknowledge that money damages are not an adequate remedy for violations of
this Agreement and that any party may, in its sole discretion, apply to a
court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or injunctive or
other relief (without the posting of any bond or other security) as such court
may deem just and proper in order to enforce this Agreement or prevent any
violation hereof by any of the parties hereto and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, each party hereof waives any objection to the
imposition of such relief. Any such specific or equitable relief granted shall
not be exclusive and an Indemnitee shall also be entitled to seek money
damages.

 

22\. _Cooperation_.

  

The parties agree to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to fulfill
obligations imposed under this Agreement. This shall include delivery of
documents in a prompt manner.
