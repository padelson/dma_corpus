Except as disclosed in <U>Schedule 4.17(a)</U>, there is no Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement or any amendment to an existing Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement that will affect the benefits of Employees or former Employees and that is to become effective after the date of this Agreement.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Each Employee Plan and Compensation Arrangement has been established, maintained, funded, operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its own terms, the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement and, where applicable, ERISA, the IRC, and any other applicable Legal Requirement. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No lien has arisen or, to the Knowledge of Sellers is reasonably expected to arise on the assets of any Seller or any ERISA Affiliate, under Section 412 of the IRC or Section 302 of ERISA in favor of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any Employee Plan.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No Seller or ERISA Affiliate is contributing to, is required to contribute to, or has contributed within the last six (6) years to, any Multiemployer Plan, and no Seller or ERISA Affiliate has incurred within the last six (6) years, or reasonably expects to incur, any "withdrawal liability," as defined under Section 4201 et seq. of ERISA.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No Seller or Affiliate of a Seller is aware of the existence of any governmental inspection, investigation, audit or examination of any Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement or of any facts which would lead it to believe that any such governmental inspection, investigation, audit or examination is pending or threatened. There exists no action, suit or claim (other than routine claims for benefits) with respect to any Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened against any such plan or arrangement, and Sellers possess no Knowledge of any facts which could give rise to any such action, suit or claim. There have been no Prohibited Transactions with respect to any Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement.

No "reportable event," as that term is defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA, has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Employee Plan. There are no unfunded liabilities with respect to any Employee Plan, i.e., the actuarial present value of all "benefit liabilities" (determined within the meaning of Section 401(a)(2) of the IRC) under each Employee Plan, whether or not vested, does not exceed the current value of the assets of such Employee Plan. All contributions, premiums or payments accrued, in whole or in part, under each Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement or with respect thereto as of the Closing will be paid by Sellers, on or prior to Closing or, if later, within the time period permitted by ERISA and the IRC.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Each Employee Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified plan" under Section 401(a) of the IRC has received a determination from the Internal Revenue Service that such Employee Plan is so qualified and nothing has occurred since the date of such determination that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan. </P></LI>

Within 30&nbsp;days after execution of this Agreement, Sellers shall identify all such services provided by any Person other than Sellers for the System and Buyer may then opt to include these services as Transition Services in the Transition Services Agreement. Based on Sellers' representations to Buyer, Buyer acknowledges that in order for Buyer to obtain billing-related Transition Services, Buyer would be required on the Closing Date to execute an Interim Letter Agreement with CSG System, Inc. substantially in the form previously provided to Buyer, <I>provided</I> it is understood that Buyer is not obligated under this Agreement to enter into an Interim Letter Agreement.</P>

Sellers will deliver or make available to Buyer at the offices of the System reasonably promptly after the date hereof the additional regulatory due diligence materials set forth on <U>Schedule 6.18</U> (the "Additional Regulatory Diligence Material"). Additional Regulatory Diligence Material that Sellers intend to deliver to Buyer (rather than make such materials available at the offices of the System) must be delivered to Buyer on or prior to September 23, 2003. All other Additional Regulatory Diligence Material shall be made available at the offices of the System, and in order for Buyer to conduct its review of such Additional Regulatory Diligence Material, each Seller shall afford to Buyer or authorized representatives and advisors of Buyer (including Buyer's prospective financing sources and their respective representatives and advisors) reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices and properties of the System where such Additional Regulatory Diligence Material is maintained, shall make available to the foregoing Persons knowledgeable personnel of the System, and shall use its best efforts to schedule any site visits requested by the foregoing Persons on the dates and at the times requested by Buyer, which shall be as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than October 14, 2003. If the Additional Regulatory Diligence Material indicates that following the Closing, Buyer or its Affiliates (as operators of the System) will incur or be obligated to pay additional operating expenses, capital expenditures or other reasonable out of pocket costs or expenses in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice thereof to Sellers on or prior to the earlier of (i) October 21, 2003, and (ii) the fifth Business Day after the date of the final site visit conducted pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 6.18. Sellers will deliver or make available to Buyer reasonably promptly after the date hereof, but in no event later than September 30, 2003, the diligence materials set forth on <U>Schedule 6.18A</U>, but such materials do not constitute Additional Regulatory Diligence Material.</P>

In the event of an Inter-Affiliate Transfer, Buyer and Sellers shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to add any such Affiliate that is the recipient of Assets pursuant to an Inter-Affiliate Transfer as an additional Seller to this Agreement; such Affiliate shall be obligated to transfer to Buyer at the Closing the Assets which were the subject of the Inter-Affiliate Transfer on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and shall otherwise have the rights and obligations of a Seller under this Agreement.

Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that Sellers desire that the term "EBS Percentage" be amended prior to the Closing to the extent required such that the Sellers' respective EBS Percentages reflect the relative fair market value of Equivalent Basic Subscribers located within the various Franchise Areas included in the System, as jointly determined by Buyer and Sellers with the assistance of Daniels &amp; Associates, Inc. ("Daniels"). Any out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with such determination (including any valuation, banking or other fees charged by Daniels) shall be borne solely by Sellers. Accordingly, promptly after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers in good faith shall endeavor to negotiate, execute and deliver a mutually satisfactory amendment to Section 1.1 of this Agreement solely for the purpose of amending the definition of "EBS Percentage" so as to reflect this principle. </DIR></P>
