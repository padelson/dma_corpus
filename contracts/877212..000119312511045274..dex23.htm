the source code of such Company software product or component thereof to any
third party other than the applicable Open Source Software.

or expiration of any waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law and the approval of any Governmental Authority, as

contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall, except

with Actions under or relating to any Antitrust Law or the Foreign Investment
and National Security Act of 2007, except as may be prohibited or restricted
by Law.

(c) Each party hereby covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to contest, defend against and appeal any threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of any party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and take any and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment
or promulgation thereof; provided, however, that Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent
and their respective Affiliates shall not be required to dispose of,
restructure or take any similar action that might restrict or otherwise
adversely affect their assets or business.

(d) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, (i) Buyer and Buyer Ultimate Parent
shall not be required to provide the Company or the Member any document

information with respect to which Buyer or Buyer Ultimate Parent (or any of
their Affiliates) has requested confidential treatment

provide Buyer or Buyer Ultimate Parent any document (including filings) or
information that by its nature would tend to reveal information with respect
to which the Member has requested confidential treatment from any Governmental

Section 5.5 _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Member shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the
Members or the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance coverage for the Companys and the Subsidiaries directors and
officers during all periods prior to and through the Closing in a form
acceptable to the Company that shall provide such directors and officers with
coverage for seven (7) years following the Closing Date of not less than the
existing coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Company. Following the Closing, Member
shall maintain such policy in full force and effect, and shall be solely
responsible for and hold Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent, the Company and the
Subsidiaries harmless from and against any indemnification obligations of the
Member, the Company or the Subsidiaries to directors and officers with respect
to events occurring on or prior to the Closing. 

Section 5.6 _Press Releases_. The parties shall each issue a press release,
mutually acceptable to the Member and Buyer, promptly after the date hereof.
The parties hereto will, and will cause each of their Affiliates and
representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of the details of any
negotiations or disputes between the parties with respect to this Agreement
and will not, and will cause each of their Affiliates not to, issue or cause
the publication of any other press release or public announcement with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided, however_ , that a
party may, without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, take any
action to enforce this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.11_ or issue or cause
publication of any press release or public announcement to the extent that
such party reasonably determines, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, such action to be required by Law or by the rules of the NASDAQ or
the NASDAQ OMX, as applicable to such party, in which event such party will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other parties hereto
reasonable time to comment on such press release or public announcement in
advance of its issuance; and _provided further_ , that any party may (a) re-
issue or republish any release previously approved by the Member and Buyer
Ultimate Parent and (b) respond in the ordinary course to investor relations
inquiries to the extent such communications do not reveal
information regarding any disputes or the details of any negotiations between
the parties.

Section 5.7 _Conflicts and Privilege_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties hereto that the Member may retain counsel to the Company (" _Counsel_
") to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of Buyer and Buyer Ultimate Parent hereby agrees that, in the
event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer and/or Buyer
Ultimate Parent and the Member, Counsel may represent the Member in such
dispute even though the interests of the Member may be directly adverse to
Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent, the Company or the Subsidiaries, and even though
Counsel may have represented the Company or the Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters
for the Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent, the Company or the Subsidiaries. Each
of Buyer and Buyer Ultimate Parent further agrees that, as to all
communications among Counsel, the

 



42  Company, the Subsidiaries and the Member that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Member and may be
controlled by the Member and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer,
Buyer Ultimate Parent, the Company or the Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, Buyer Ultimate
Parent, the Company or the Subsidiaries and a third party other than a party
to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Counsel to such third party; _provided, however_ , that
neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Member.

 

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefit Arrangements_.

(a) _General_. Buyer shall offer each person who is listed on _Schedule
2.12(e)_ who is not employed by the Company or a Subsidiary as of the Closing,
including those: (i) on normal scheduled vacation or (ii) identified on
_Schedule 5.8(a)(ii)_ as being on or scheduled to be on leave of absence as of
the date hereof, which Schedule also sets forth the type of leave (e.g., FMLA)
and anticipated duration of such leave (the " _Transferred Company Employees_
"), continued employment in a comparable position immediately after the
Closing, subject to such persons reasonably satisfactory completion of the
standard employment application process applicable to comparable employees of
Buyer and its Affiliates. Buyer shall ensure that all of the persons who are
employed by the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing, including
those: (i) on normal scheduled vacation or (ii) identified on Schedule
5.8(a)(ii) as being on or scheduled to be on leave of absence as of the date
hereof, which Schedule also sets forth the type of leave (e.g., FMLA) and
anticipated duration of such leave (the " _Continuing Company Employees_ "
and together with the Transferred Company Employees, the " _Company Employees_
"), will remain employed in a comparable position immediately after the
Closing, provided, however, that, the foregoing shall not be deemed a
contract of employment with any Person and Buyer retains the discretion to
terminate the employment of any Company Employees after Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not be deemed a contract of employment
with any Person and Buyer retains the discretion to terminate the employment
of any Company Employees after Closing. Company Employees shall be credited
for their length of service with, or credited by, the Member, the Company or
the Subsidiaries for all purposes to the extent permitted under any benefit
plan or program or fringe benefit made available to Company Employees by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates after the Closing; _provided, however_ , that such
service shall not be so credited (i) for purposes of calculating accrued
benefits under any defined benefit pension plan or (ii) to the extent that
crediting such service would result in the duplication of either benefits or
accruals to any Company Employee. Buyer shall provide the Company Employees
with comparable employee benefits maintained from time to time by Buyer for
similarly-situated employees of Buyer; _provided, however_ , to the extent the
Company Employees are eligible for health, dental, vision, long-term
disability, accidental death and dismemberment and/or life insurance benefits
under the Benefit Plans prior to the Closing, the Company Employees shall
remain covered under such Benefit Plans until the Transfer Date (as defined
below). In order for Buyer to enroll the Company Employees in Buyers welfare
benefit plans, the Member shall provide the census data described in _Schedule
5.8(a)_. Buyer shall enroll the Company Employees in Buyers health, dental,
vision, long-term disability, accidental death and dismemberment and/or life
insurance plans as of the later of (i) the Closing, or (ii) five business days
after the Member provides the required census data, at which time the Company
Employees shall cease to be eligible under the Benefit Plans ("Transfer
Date").

 



43 (b) _No Duplicative Benefits_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, any of the Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of its Affiliates to provide
duplicative benefits or accruals to any Company Employee (or anyone else) or
to employ or continue to employ any Company Employee or anyone else, and
except to the extent expressly provided in this _Section 5.8_, nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as in any way limiting or restricting
Buyers ability to amend, modify or terminate any wage packages or programs
or any benefit plan at any time and from time to time, including any Benefit
Plan, after the Closing.

 

(c) _Employee Communications_. Subject to _Section 5.6_, Buyer shall be
permitted, after the date of this Agreement and subject to the consent of the
Member, to communicate in writing with and solicit elections from Company
Employees with respect to matters described in this _Section 5.8 _and in
order to enable Buyer to accomplish the various administrative processes
required under this _Section 5.8_, including (i) employee education and
enrollment and elections under the various benefit plans in which Company
Employees will participate on and after the Closing and (ii) the negotiation,
amendment and implementation of retention and similar arrangements to be
effective following Closing.

(d)  _Bonuses_. At or prior to Closing, Member shall cause the Company and,
where applicable, the Subsidiaries to calculate and pay any bonuses accrued
and payable prior to the Closing under the incentive plans listed on _Schedule
5.8(d)_ (the " _Incentive Plans_ "). To the extent not paid at or prior to
Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company or the Subsidiaries to pay such
bonuses, provided that such bonuses are or will be accrued as Current
Liabilities on the Closing Statement. Such bonuses shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of the Incentive Plan to which the bonus relates.
Member and Company may establish 2011 incentive plans for Company Employees
covering the one-year performance period ending on December 31, 2011;
_provided, however_ , that any such plan shall be comparable in all material
respects to a corresponding Incentive Plan, including with respect to
performance goals, employee grade levels, number of employees eligible
to participate, target incentive amounts for employee grade levels and
vesting, forfeiture and termination provisions. Beginning on the Closing, each
Company Employee shall be eligible to participate in one or more Buyer bonus
plans or programs that are at least as favorable as those made available to
employees of Buyer with comparable levels of responsibility. Except as
provided in this _Section 5.8(d)_, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
adopted or will before Closing adopt any other bonus or incentive
compensation plan or similar arrangement with respect to the 2011 year or
thereafter.

(e)  _US Benefits_. The following provisions shall apply to Company Employees
located in the United States:

 

(i) _Welfare Benefits_. With respect to the Company Employees, after the
Closing, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the liability and
obligation for, and neither the Member nor any of its Affiliates shall have
any liability or obligation for: any short-term disability, sick pay or salary
continuation attributable to periods after Closing. With respect to the
Company Employees, after the Transfer Date,

 



44  Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the liability and
obligation for, and neither the Member nor any of its Affiliates shall have
any liability or obligation for: any medical, vision, dental, life insurance,
long-term disability or other welfare benefit claims attributable to periods
after the Transfer Date. Any preexisting condition clause in any of Buyers
Benefit Programs (including medical, dental and disability coverage) in which
Company Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing shall be
waived for each Company Employee to the extent such Company Employees
creditable coverage under the Members health plan (or any other health
plan in which such Company Employee participated) exceeds the maximum
duration of any preexisting condition limitation under Buyers health plan, as
required by law. Buyer shall credit the Company Employees with any amounts
paid under the Benefit Plans on or prior to the Closing toward satisfaction
of the applicable deductible amounts and copayment obligations under the
corresponding Buyer Benefit Programs for the plan year in which the Company
Employees become eligible to participate in Buyer Benefit Programs, provided
the Member provides to Buyer within 10 days after Closing the information
providing the deductibles and copayments credited to each such Company
Employee as of Closing.

 

(ii) _COBRA_. If any employee or former employee of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries covered under any health plan in which the employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary participate prior to the Transfer Date has a
"qualifying event" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code, which
occurs on or before the date such employee or former employee is covered
under Buyers health plan, then the Member shall be responsible for providing
such individual (and such individuals "qualified beneficiaries" within the
meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code) with the continuation of group
health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

(iii)  _Severance_. For a period commencing on the day after the Closing and
ending no earlier than December 31, 2011, Buyer agrees to offer each Company
Employee whose employment is terminated during such period severance pay
determined in accordance with the terms set forth in _Schedule 5.8(e)(iii)_
or if greater, the amount under Buyers severance plan(s) or policy(ies), if
any, for similarly situated employees. Employees who are parties to the
retention and severance agreements identified on _Schedule 5.8(e)(iii)_ shall
receive any severance benefits in accordance with the terms of such agreement
in lieu of the terms set forth in _Schedule 5.8(e)(iii)_. Buyer shall
reimburse the Member for its liabilities for the payment of any severance
benefits that become payable to a Company Employee under the Zebra
Technologies Corporation Severance Plan (as Amended and Restated Effective
July 1, 2009) (the " _Member s Severance Plan_") to the extent Buyer fails
to offer a Company Employee a "Comparable Position" (as such term is defined
in the Members Severance Plan) and provided such Company Employee does not
accept any other position with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on or after the
Closing; provided further, that no other exception to the payment of severance
benefits under the Members Severance Plan applies.

 

(iv) _WARN_. None of the Member, the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates shall, at any time within the 90-day period prior to
the Closing, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff as those terms are
defined in WARN and similar state and local rules, statutes and ordinances,
affecting in whole or in 

 



45  part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee of any of
the Company or the Subsidiaries. The Member agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer
harmless for any Action by a Company Employee for back pay, front pay,
benefits or compensatory or punitive damages, any Action by any Governmental
Authority for penalties regarding any issue of prior notification (or lack
thereof) of any plant closing or mass layoff, occurring prior to the Closing
and Buyers costs, including costs of collection, attorneys fees and other
costs of defense, in defending such Actions. Buyer, the Company and the
Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations under
WARN (and such similar rules, statutes and ordinances) resulting from the
actions or inactions of Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries after
the Closing. Buyer agrees to hold the Member harmless for any breach of such
responsibility and Buyers indemnification of the Member in this regard
specifically includes any Action by the Company Employees for back pay, front
pay, benefits or compensatory or punitive damages, any Action by any
Governmental Authority for penalties regarding any issue of prior
notification (or lack thereof) of any plant closing or mass layoff occurring
after the Closing and the Members costs, including reasonable attorneys
fees, in defending any such Actions.

 

(v) _Flexible Spending Accounts_. With respect to the year in which the
Closing occurs, Buyer shall cause Company Employees to be eligible to
participate in a flexible spending account for medical and dependent care
expenses maintained under Sections 125 and 129 of the Code (an " _FSA_ ")
maintained by Buyer (" _Buyer s FSA_"). As soon as administratively
practicable after the Closing, the Member shall transfer to Buyer an amount
equal to the total contributions made to the Members FSA by Company Employees
in respect of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, reduced by an amount
equal to the total claims already paid to Company Employees in respect of such
plan year. To the extent permitted by law, Buyer and the Member intend that
the actions to be taken pursuant to this subsection be treated as
an assumption by Buyer of the portion of Members FSA and the elections made
thereunder attributable to Company Employees.

(vi) _401(k) Plan_. As expeditiously as possible after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause Company Employees to be eligible to participate in a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan maintained by Buyer (" _Buyer s Savings Plan_") to
the extent consistent with such plans terms, including eligibility
requirements. The Member shall provide such information as is reasonably
necessary to allow Buyer to enroll the Company Employees in Buyers Savings
Plan. The parties shall effectuate a trust-to-trust transfer of the account
balances of Company Employees under the Members Profit Sharing and Retirement
Plan ("Members Savings Plan") to Buyers Savings Plan designated by Buyer,
as follows. As soon as practicable after the Closing, but no later than 180
days after the Closing, the Member shall cause the account of each Company
Employee who participates in Members Savings Plan to be valued pursuant to
the terms of Members Savings Plan. As of such valuation date, assets equal in
value to the amount credited to each such Company Employees account under
Members Savings Plan will be transferred to the trust maintained under
Buyers Savings Plan. Such transferred assets shall be in cash (except for any
promissory notes evidencing outstanding loan balances of the Company
Employees, which shall be transferred in kind), and shall be in accordance
with Section 414(1) of the Code. Prior to, and as a condition of, any transfer
of assets each party shall provide the other with satisfactory evidence that
its plan is tax-qualified 

 



46  within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code. As of the transfer date,
Buyers Savings Plan will have sole liability for the payment of benefits
accrued by the Company Employees under Members Savings Plan and transferred
in respect of such employees.

(vii) _Vacation_. Buyer shall not unreasonably restrict the ability of
Company Employees to take unused vacation earned as of the Closing and
reflected on the Closing Statement and set forth by Company Employee on
_Schedule 5.8(e)(vii)_.

 

(f) _Member Plans_. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Buyer, Buyer Ultimate
Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary is assuming any Member Plans (defined
below) or obligations thereunder. Member shall administer and perform all
obligations (including the withholding and remittal of all employment and
withholding taxes) under the Benefit Plans adopted, maintained or
previously assumed by the Member, including the Benefit Plans set forth on
_Schedule 5.8(f)_ ("Member Plans") with respect to participants in such plans
(including Company Employees) after the Closing.

 

(g) _Information to be Provided by the Member_. The Member shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the information set forth on
_Schedule 5.8(g)_ within 21 days of the date of this Agreement and, in any
event, shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
information that it is unable to provide within such time period as soon
as reasonably practicable.

(h) _International Employee Plans_. Within 30 days of the date hereof, Buyer
may direct the Member in writing to terminate or to cause the Company or any
Subsidiary to terminate, any or all of the International Employee Plans
identified on _Schedule 5.8(h)_ (each, a " _Designated International Plan_ ").
Upon such direction, the Member shall terminate or cause the Company or the
appropriate Subsidiary to terminate such Designated International Plan
effective as of the Closing and such Designated International Plan shall be
treated as a "Member Plan" for all purposes of this Agreement, including
_Section 5.8_ and _Section 7.2_.

Section 5.9 _Books and Records_. Buyer shall until the seventh (7th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and other documents
pertaining to the Business in existence on the Closing Date and make the same
available for inspection and copying by the Member or any of the
representatives of the Member at the expense of the Member during the normal
business hours of Buyer upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice.

 

Section 5.10 _Further Action_. Each of the parties hereto shall use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all
appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable and execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.11 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Member shall, at its own expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that
have not yet been filed and are required to

 



47  be filed after the Closing Date. Member shall pay or cause to be paid any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. If any such Tax Return must be
signed by Buyer, any Affiliate thereof, or the Company or the Subsidiaries
(or any representative of the foregoing) following the Closing Date, Buyer
agrees that it will (or will cause such other parties to) cooperate fully and
punctually in signing such Tax Return in order to permit the timely filing of
such Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt Member shall (A) file a U.S.
federal income Tax Return of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the
Companys taxable year ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(c) and (B) allocate all items accruing on the
Closing Date to the Companys taxable period ending on the Closing Date
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and not
pursuant to the "next day" rule under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or pursuant to the ratable allocation method under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii)).

 

(b) Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company or the Subsidiaries, for taxable years
or periods ending after the Closing Date. Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to the Company or the Subsidiaries for Straddle
Periods (" _Straddle Returns_ ") shall be prepared consistently with past
practice to the extent permitted by applicable law. Buyer shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to Member a draft of any Straddle Return at least 30
days prior to the due date, giving effect to extensions thereto, for filing
such Tax Return, for review by Member. Member shall notify Buyer of any
reasonable objections Member may have to any items set forth in such draft
Straddle Return and Buyer and Member agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any such objection. If the parties cannot resolve any such objections,
the item in question shall be resolved by KPMG (the " _Independent Accountant_
"). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally
by Member and Buyer. Buyer shall notify Member of any amounts due from Member
in respect of any Straddle Return no later than 10 Business Days prior to the
date on which such Straddle Return is due, and no later than 5 Business Days
prior to the date on which such Straddle Return is due, Member shall pay to
Buyer the amount of Taxes for which Member is responsible, but in all events,
no later than 10 days after demand is made.

(c) For purposes of apportioning any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period to a
Pre-Closing Taxable Period, such apportionment shall be made assuming that the
relevant entity had a taxable year that ended at the close of business on the
Closing Date. In the case of property Taxes and similar Taxes which apply
ratably to a taxable period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of
the Straddle Period that is a Pre-Closing Taxable Period shall equal the Tax
for the period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of days in the period up to and including the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the period.

 

(d) For the portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing, other than
transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Buyer shall carry on the Business
only in the ordinary course in the same manner as previously conducted.

(e) Upon written request of Member, Buyer shall, at Members expense, cause
the Company to file for, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
expedite the receipt of, any refund to which the Company or the Subsidiaries
may be entitled with respect 

 



48  to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period; _provided, however_ , that if any such
refund could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the liability of the
Company and/or the Subsidiaries for Taxes for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, Buyer may, in its sole discretion,
refuse to cause the Company to file for any such refund until a mutual
agreement with respect thereto is reached between the Member and Buyer. Any
Tax refunds that are received by Buyer, the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer, the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries becomes entitled (including any interest paid
or credited with respect thereto but reduced by any expenses of Buyer in
obtaining such refunds or credits), that relate to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods
shall be for the account of Member, and Buyer shall pay over to Member any
such refund or amount of any such credit within 15 days after receipt or
entitlement thereto. Any such refunds or credits relating to Straddle Periods
shall be equitably apportioned between Buyer and Member.

 

(f) Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries, and the Member shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 5.11_,
the provision of information relating to Tax Liabilities and potential Tax
Liabilities relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries for all Pre-
Closing Taxable Periods and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and the
provision of records and information (upon the other partys request, at the
expense of the requesting party) that are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Company and the Subsidiaries and the
Member agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Member, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable period, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii)
to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, the Company and the Subsidiaries or the Member, as the case may be,
shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records;
_provided_ that nothing in this Section shall require the Member to provide
any books or records relating to any consolidated returns of the Member. In
addition, the Member shall assist Buyer in determining the Tax attributes
allocable or apportionable to the Company within 60 days following the filing
of the U.S. federal income Tax Return for the Companys taxable year ending on
the Closing Date. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall deliver
to Buyer within 30 days from the date of this Agreement, but in no event later
than the Closing Date, correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns not
otherwise previously provided, including any federal and state non-income Tax
Returns and all foreign Tax Returns, in each case relating to the Company and
the Subsidiaries for each of its three (3) taxable years immediately preceding
the Closing Date. The Company shall also deliver to Buyer within 30 days from
the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than the Closing Date, any
revenue agents reports and other notices from the Internal Revenue Service,
or state, local or foreign taxing authorities relating to the Company and the
Subsidiaries, for each of its three (3) taxable years immediately preceding
the Closing Date.

(g) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company and the Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company and the Subsidiaries
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder. 

 



49 (h) Buyer shall not file an amended Tax Return for the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Taxable Period without the prior written
consent of Member, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

(i) Buyer shall elect to waive any carryback of net operating losses under
Section 172(b)(3) of the Code for losses attributable to taxable periods
beginning after the Closing Date.

 

(j) Whenever any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment, or
otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Member is or may be liable
under this Agreement, Buyer shall, if informed of such an assertion, promptly
inform Member, and Member shall have the right to control any resulting
proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim,
assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or determinations affect
the amount of Taxes for which Member may be liable under this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that if such settlement could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the liability of the Company or the Subsidiaries for Taxes
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date,
such settlement shall not be agreed to without the consent of Buyer, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Failure to make such
notification shall not alter Members liability therefore, except to the
extent Member is actually prejudiced by Buyers failure to notify Member.

 

(k) Whenever any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment, or
otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which the Company and/or any of
the Subsidiaries is or may be liable under this Agreement, Member shall, if
informed of such an assertion, promptly inform Buyer, and Buyer shall have the
right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when
to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such
proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which the Company
and/or any of the Subsidiaries may be liable under this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that if such settlement could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the liability of the Member for Taxes for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, such settlement shall
not be agreed to without the consent of Member, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Failure to make such notification shall not
alter the Companys liability therefore, except to the extent the Company is
actually prejudiced by Members failure to notify Buyer. 

(l) The Member shall be solely liable for and shall pay when due any transfer,
value added, excise, stock transfer, stamp, recording, registration and
similar Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, if any.

 

(m) Upon request of the Buyer (which request shall be made not later than the
90th day following the Closing Date), the Member shall join with the Buyer in
making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and, at Buyers
election, any corresponding elections under appropriate state, local or
foreign laws) with respect to the purchase and sale set forth in
this Agreement (the "(h)(10) Election"), including, where designated by
Buyer, elections

 



50  at the subsidiary level. Buyer may make the corresponding state, local or
foreign elections referred to in the parenthetical of the previous sentence on
a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Upon request of the Buyer, the Company
shall cause three (3) IRS Forms 8023 and any other appropriate election forms
pursuant to applicable state, local or foreign elections being made to be
prepared, executed by the Member and submitted to the Buyer on or before the
Closing Date. The Buyer and the Member shall cooperate fully with each other
and make available to each other such Tax data and other information as may be
reasonably required by the Buyer or the Member in order to timely file the
(h)(10) Election and any other required statements or schedules. In addition,
if an (h)(10) Election is made, (i) Buyer shall deliver copies of the filed
election forms to the Member with thirty (30) days of filing such forms with
the appropriate taxing authorities, (ii) the Member and Buyer shall file all
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the (h)(10) Election, including the
reasonable determination of the fair market value of the assets of the Company
and the Subsidiaries, and will not take any position contrary thereto, (iii)
the parties agree that the Consideration and the liabilities of the Company
and the Subsidiaries (plus other relevant items) will be allocated to the
assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries as provided on _Schedule
5.11(m)_, prepared jointly by Buyer and the Member in accordance with Sections
338 and 1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder, as may be
amended by the joint agreement of Buyer and the Member in good faith to
reflect the operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries through the Closing
Date, or in the event any adjustment is required to be made as a result of the
payment of any additional Consideration for the Company Units or otherwise,
(iv) Buyer and the Member shall file all Tax Returns (including amended
returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner consistent
with _Schedule 5.11(m)_, as amended, and will not take any position contrary
thereto, and (v) all Taxes that are attributable to the making of the (h)(10)
Election (or any similar state, local or foreign Section 338(h)(10) (but not
Section 338(g)) election) will be borne and paid by the Member (and the
Member shall indemnify Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries against any
loss, claim, liability, expense or other damage attributable to or arising out
of any failure to pay such Taxes).

 

(n) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, at Buyers election, the
parties shall treat Buyer, the Company or an Affiliate (as applicable) as a
"successor employer" within the meaning Treasury Regulations Sections
31.3121(a)(1)-1(b)(2) and 31.3306(b)(1)-1(b)(2) with respect to Company
Employees who are not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary as of
the Closing Date. Upon making such election, the Member shall provide Buyer
payroll and other information necessary to treat Buyer as such a successor
employer (to the extent not already provided to Buyer in accordance with this
Agreement) and file all returns and reports consistent with such treatment.

Section 5.12 _Exclusivity_. Each of the Member and the Company agree that
between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement, neither party shall, and shall take all action
necessary to ensure that none of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates shall (i) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage
or accept any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate, assist or participate in, facilitate or
encourage the submission of, any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Each of the
Member and the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to: (a)

Section 5.13 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

(a) Member covenants and agrees that:

(i) during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), Member shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not, other than on behalf of Buyer,
Buyer Ultimate Parent and their respective subsidiaries, engage, directly or
indirectly, anywhere in the world in the development, sale, resale or license
of Terminal Operating Systems or Marine Terminal Software; _provided that_ ,
nothing herein shall prohibit the acquisition or ownership of up to two
percent (2%) of the outstanding stock of a publicly-traded company that

their respective Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, entice or
induce any Person employed or engaged during the Solicitation Restricted
Period in the Business as conducted by Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing, the
Company), to terminate his or her employment or engagement with, or not accept
an employment or consulting arrangement with, Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing,
the Company), except for general solicitations of employment (such as a

to any Person employed during the Solicitation Restricted Period in the
Business as conducted by Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or (b) hire any Person identified on _Schedule
5.16(a)_ who at the time of hiring, or at any time within the 12 months

preceding sentence shall not apply to any Person who is terminated without
cause by Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
after the Closing.

 



52 (b) Member acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in 
_Section 5.13(a) _are a reasonable and necessary protection of the immediate
interests of Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent and the Company, and that Buyer and
Buyer Ultimate Parent would not have entered into this Agreement without
receiving the consideration offered by Member in binding Member and its
Affiliates to these restrictions. If any provision contained in _Section
5.13(a)_ shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of _Section 5.13(a)_, but _Section 5.13(a)_ shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area
or to be for a length of time that is not permitted by applicable Law, or in
any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision
shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent
such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform  _Section
5.13(a)_ to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic
area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained
herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law. The
parties agree that _Section 5.13(a)(i)_ is not intended to restrict Member
or its Affiliates from any activities with respect to products or services
offered by Member and/or its Affiliates (other than the Subsidiaries) other
than Terminal Operating Systems or Marine Terminal Software.

unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees each and every representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement and obligation of the Buyer to the Member, and
the full and timely performance of the Buyers obligations (including all
payment obligations), in each case under the provisions of this Agreement.
This is a guarantee of payment and performance and Buyer Ultimate Parent
acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no
release or extinguishment of the Buyers obligations or liability (other than
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in any
bankruptcy Action or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guarantee. Nothing herein is intended to, nor shall,
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

Section 5.15 _Change of Name; Use of Trademarks_.

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, Member shall effect the
change of the names of the Company and the Subsidiaries so that each name does
not include the word Zebra and to otherwise remove any other reference or
indicia associated with Member, and any confusingly similar
variations, derivations or abbreviations of any of the foregoing.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, and except as expressly authorized under
the Transition Services Agreement, the Transitional Trademark License and the
Reseller Agreement, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including
Company and the Subsidiaries), members and shareholders not to, use the
words Zebra, WhereNet, and any confusingly similar variations,
derivations or abbreviations of the words Zebra or WhereNet, including any

business activity anywhere in the world.

 



53 Section 5.16 _Transfers with Respect to the WhereNet Marine Business_.
The Member shall cause the transfer of the WhereNet Marine Business to the

forth on  _Schedule 5.16(a)_ transfer or grant any licenses in, to or under
any Intellectual Property of any third party, Member, or its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) or transfer any licenses of
Intellectual Property of any third party, including the third party contracts
and Intellectual Property identified in _Schedule 5.16(b)_ ; provided, that
the Member and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Company in establishing and obtaining such contracts,
relationships and rights to the extent provided in the Assignment and

agreements will constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any contract or
Intellectual Property set forth in _Schedule 5.16(a)_ or any claim or right or
any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if (i) an attempted
assignment thereof, without consent of a third party thereto, would
constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or in any way adversely
affect the rights of Buyer, Company or its Subsidiaries or Member or its
Affiliates thereunder or (ii) such contracts, Intellectual Property or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom would
infringe any other Persons copyright, trade secret rights, right of privacy,

parties to any such contracts, Intellectual Property or claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder for the assignment or transfer thereof to Company
as Buyer may request. If such consent is not obtained, or if an attempted
assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights
of Member or its Affiliates thereunder so that Buyer or Company would not in
fact receive all such rights, Member, its Affiliates, Buyer, Company and its
Subsidiaries will perform the applicable obligations set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement and otherwise cooperate in a mutually agreeable
arrangement under which Buyer or Company would obtain the benefits and assume
the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement and the
Transition Services Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing, or
subleasing to or for Buyer or Company, or under which Member or its Affiliates
would enforce for the benefit of Buyer or Company, Members and its
Affiliates obligations, any and all rights of Member and its Affiliates
against a third party thereto. Except as expressly set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement to the contrary, Member will promptly pay to Buyer or
Company when received all monies received by Member under any contract set
forth in _Section 5.16(a)_ or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder.

until the expiration of the applicable service obligation under the
Transition Service Agreement, Member and its Affiliates will use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) maintain each such Reseller Agreement in effect in
accordance with its terms, (ii) assist the Company in establishing and
obtaining new contracts with the counter party to each such Reseller
Agreement, (iii) upon Companys request, fill orders from and resell the
applicable products to, Company or Companys customers, and (iv) provide to

Source Materials on deposit under such Source Code Escrow Agreement, (ii)

in a separate source code escrow account for the benefit of the applicable
customer on terms substantially similar to the terms and conditions in such
existing Source Code Escrow Agreement, (iii) have Company deposit the
Transferred MTS Application in a separate source code escrow account for the
benefit of the applicable customer on terms substantially similar to the
terms and conditions in such existing Source Code Escrow Agreement, (iv) until
such separate source code escrow agreements are established, Member, its
Affiliates, and Company will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement and
take all necessary actions to prevent any release of the Source Materials
under such existing Source Code Escrow Agreement and to comply with the
obligations thereunder to protect the Source Materials, and (v) obtain any
necessary consents of the applicable customer beneficiaries under such
existing Source Code Escrow Agreement.

(d) _Third Party Components_. With respect to the Intellectual Property set
forth in _Schedule 5.16(b)_ , Member, its Affiliates, and Company will, at
Members expense, use commercially reasonable efforts and otherwise cooperate
to obtain the licenses to each such item of Intellectual Property in the name
of Company prior to the Closing Date, and in the event that such licenses are
not obtained in the name of Navis by the Closing Date, then (i) Member and its
Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Company
the benefits and rights under such licenses, whether by subcontracting,
sublicensing, or subleasing, and (ii) Member, its Affiliates, and Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company in establishing and
obtaining such licenses in the name of Company as soon as practicable
thereafter.

(e) _Shared Software Modules and Libraries_. Member, its Affiliates, the
Company and the Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to
identify the proprietary software modules or libraries owned by Member or its

Application within 15 days, and such shared software will be licensed to the
Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Source
Code License

 



55  Agreement (TTS), _provided_ , _however_ , that Member, its Affiliates, Buyer
and Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to determine whether any
such shared software is primarily related to or used by the Transferred MTS
Application and in which case such shared software will be transferred to
Company under the MTS Contribution Agreement and licensed back to Member and
its Affiliates under the Source Code License Agreement (MTS).

(f) _Transition Services_. Within 15 days, Member, its Affiliates, Buyer the
Company and the Subsidiaries, will use commercially reasonable efforts to

and/or any of its Subsidiaries, infringes any 848 Application Patent; 

(b) the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or importation by or on behalf

Telematics Solution) directly or contributorily infringes any Member Patent
or induces the infringement of any Member Patent provided that such Marine
Telematics Solution excluding the Covered Application does not infringe or has

_ARTICLE VII - SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION_

Section 7.1 _Survival_. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of
this Agreement, and except in the event of fraud, the representations and
warranties of the parties hereto contained herein, as the case may be, shall
survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the date
that is 18 months after the Closing Date (the " _Indemnification Termination
Date_ "), after which such time they shall expire and terminate and be of no
further force and effect; _provided, however_ , that the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2_, _Section 2.3_,
_Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_ and _Section 4.1 _shall not expire and the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in  _Section 2.9_
(collectively, the " _Statutory Representations_ ") shall survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (as applied to Statutory
Representation, the " _Statutory Termination Date_ "); _provided further_ ,
that, as provided in _Section 7.2(c)(iii)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_, any written
claim for breach made prior to the applicable expiration date shall survive
thereafter and, as to any such claim, such expiration will not affect the
rights to indemnification of the party making such claim.

Section 7.2  _Indemnification by the Member_.

(a) The Member agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and without duplication, to indemnify Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent
and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors and employees (each a "
_Buyer Indemnified Party_ ") against and hold them harmless from all Losses
resulting from any:

(i) breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
_Article II_ above; 

(ii) breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement or any of the other agreements entered into in connection herewith;

(iii) Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period including any and
all Liability to any Governmental Authority for the failure to pay any Tax or
file any Tax Return or qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where the
operation of the Companys or any of the Subsidiaries business would require
the payment of any Tax and/or the filing of any Tax Return;

(iv) Taxes of (a) any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or
unitary group of which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or
any corresponding or similar state, local, or foreign Tax law or regulation
and (b) any Person (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) imposed on
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing; and

 



60 (v) items set forth on _Schedule 7.2(a)(v)_.

 

(b) The Member also agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties against and hold them
harmless from all Losses resulting from: (i) the breach of any representation
or warranty of the Member contained in _Article III_ above and (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement of the Member or any of its Affiliates contained
in this Agreement or any of the other agreements entered into in connection
herewith.

(c) Except in the event of fraud, the indemnification obligations of the
Member pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ shall be
limited as follows:

 

(i) The Member shall have no obligation to provide any indemnification until
the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses that would otherwise be
indemnifiable exceeds 0.5% of the Closing Consideration (the " _Deductible
Amount_ "), at which point the Member shall be obligated to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Parties against and hold them harmless from all Losses to
the extent such Losses exceed 0.25% of the Closing Consideration; provided,
however, that: (a) the Member shall have no obligation to provide any
indemnification for any individual claim or series of related claims for
Losses of less than $25,000 and (b) this _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ shall not apply
to any Losses arising out of breaches of _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2_,
_Section 2.3_, _Section 2.9_, _Section 2.16_,  _Section 3.1_ or _Section
3.2_; and

(ii) The Member shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party for any amount of indemnifiable Losses in excess of 15% of the Closing
Consideration in the aggregate (the "Cap"); provided, however, that this
section _Section 7.2(c)(ii) _shall not apply to any Losses arising out of
breaches of _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2_, _Section 2.3_, _Section 2.9_,
_Section 2.16_, _Section 3.1_ or _Section 3.2_; and

 

(iii) No indemnification shall be payable to a Buyer Indemnified Party with
respect to claims asserted by such Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ after the Indemnification
Termination Date or, in the case of claims that arise from or result from, or
are directly or indirectly connected with, any breach of the Statutory
Representations, after the applicable Statutory Termination Date; provided,
that in the event a claim has been properly made on or prior to the
Indemnification Termination Date or the applicable Statutory Termination Date,
as the case may be, and such claim is unresolved as of the Indemnification
Termination Date or the applicable Statutory Termination Date, as the case may
be, then the right to indemnification with respect to such claim shall remain
in effect until such matter shall have been finally determined.

(d) For purposes of calculating Losses under this _Section 7.2_ for
any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant, any qualification
contained in such representation, warranty or covenant using words "material,"
"materially" or "material adverse effect" shall be disregarded and deemed not
to include such words. In no event shall the aggregate Losses recoverable by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ exceed the
Consideration.

 



61 (e) The amount of any and all Losses recoverable under this _Section 7.2_
shall be determined net of any amounts actually recovered by any Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect thereto under or pursuant to any insurance
policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or
contract pursuant to which or under which such Buyer Indemnified Party is a
party or has rights.

(f) A Buyer Indemnified Party shall give the Member written notice of any
Action by or in respect of a third party as to which such Buyer Indemnified
Party may request indemnification hereunder or as to which the Deductible
Amount may be applied as soon as is practicable. If the document evidencing
such Action is a court pleading, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall give such
notice, including a copy of such pleading, within 15 days of receipt of such
pleading; otherwise, it shall give such notice within 30 days of the date it
receives written notice of such Action; _provided, however_ , that the
failure to notify the Member within such time periods shall not affect rights
to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Member is actually
prejudiced by such failure. The Member shall notify the Buyer Indemnified
Party whether it elects to assume the defense of such Action within 20 days of
the Buyer Indemnified Partys notice of such Action. Failure by the Member to
so notify the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed an election by the
Member not to assume the defense of such Action and a waiver by the Member of
any right to assume such defense. If the Member timely notifies the Buyer
Indemnified Party that it elects to assume the defense of such Action, it
shall have the right to direct, through counsel of its own choosing, the
defense or settlement of any such Action at its own expense; provided, it
shall take all reasonable steps necessary in such defense and shall hold Buyer
Indemnified Parties, to the extent provided in this _Section 7.2_, harmless
from and against all Losses arising out of or resulting from any settlement
approved by the Member or any judgment in connection with such Action. Without
limiting the foregoing, if the Member elects to assume the defense of any
such Action:

(i) the Member shall consult with the Buyer Indemnified Party for the purpose
of allowing the Buyer Indemnified Party to participate in such defense, but in
such case the expenses of the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be paid by the
Buyer Indemnified Party;

 

(ii) a Buyer Indemnified Party shall provide and shall cause the Company and
Subsidiaries to provide, as applicable, the Member and counsel with access to
its records and personnel relating to any such Action during normal business
hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the Member in the defense or
settlement thereof, and the Member shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnified
Party for all its reasonable out of pocket expenses in connection therewith to
the extent provided in this _Section 7.2_;

(iii) the Buyer Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any
part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless the
Member consents in writing to such payment; and 

(iv) the Member shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to such Action if such settlement, compromise or
judgment (a) involves a 

 



62  finding or admission of wrongdoing, (b) does not include an unconditional
written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Buyer Indemnified Party
from all liability in respect of such Action or (c) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the Buyer Indemnified Party other than solely
the payment of money damages for which the Buyer Indemnified Party will be
indemnified hereunder.

 

If the Member does not elect to assume such defense, fails to defend or if,
after commencing or undertaking any such defense, fails to prosecute or
withdraws from such defense, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right
to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, and in such case, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified hereunder to the extent provided in
this  _Section 7.2_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if: (i)
defendants in any action include any of Buyer Indemnified Parties and the
Member, and if any Buyer Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel
that there may be material legal defenses available to such Buyer Indemnified
Party that are not available to the Member or (ii) if a conflict of interest
exists between any Buyer Indemnified Party and the Member with respect to such
claim or the defense thereof, then in either case, such Buyer Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in such action, and in
such case, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified hereunder for
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel to the extent provided in
this _Section 7.2_.

 

(h) Buyer and each Buyer Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to
mitigate Losses for which indemnification may be claimed by them pursuant to
this Agreement upon and after becoming aware of any event that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Losses.

(i) Any liability for indemnification under this _Section 7.2_ shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Member shall not have any liability under any
provision of this Agreement for any punitive, special or exemplary damages. 

(j) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any indemnification with
respect to Taxes shall be limited to Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing
Taxable Periods and Member shall not be liable for any Taxes resulting from
Buyers actions taken outside the ordinary course of business not contemplated
by this Agreement after the Closing on the Closing Date. 

(k) _Payment_. The assets held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
shall be used to satisfy the indemnification obligations of the Member under
_Section 7.2 _in the following manner:

(i) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall proceed first against the funds held in
escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement until such time as either: (a) Buyer
Indemnified Parties have made claims under the Escrow Agreement in the
aggregate equal to or greater than the Escrow Funds or (b) the Escrow Funds
have been otherwise distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



63 (ii) After the occurrence of either condition described in  _Section
7.2(k)(i)_, Buyer Indemnified Parties, or any of them, shall be entitled to
proceed directly against the Member for all claims for indemnification under
_Section 7.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer Indemnified Parties
obligation under _Section 7.2(k)(i)_ terminates because Buyer Indemnified
Parties have made claims under the Escrow Agreement in the aggregate equal to
or greater than the Escrow Funds, Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall nevertheless have the right, but not the obligation, to proceed against
the assets held in escrow in connection with additional claims for
indemnification under _Section 7.2 _until such time as all assets held in
escrow have been distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(l) _Release_. Upon the Initial Escrow Release Date, the amount in the Escrow
Account in excess of an amount equal to 50% of the Escrow Amount shall be
delivered to the Member; _provided_ , _however_ , any such amounts that are
reasonably necessary to satisfy any outstanding unsatisfied claims specified
in any notice delivered under _Section 7.2_ shall also be retained in the
Escrow Account in addition to an amount equal to 50% of the Escrow Amount.
Upon the Second Escrow Release Date, the remaining balance of the Escrow
Account shall promptly be delivered to the Member; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Escrow Account shall not terminate with respect to, and to the extent
of, and there shall be retained in the Escrow Account, any such amounts
reasonably necessary to satisfy any outstanding unsatisfied claims specified
in any notice delivered under _Section 7.2_ on or prior to the Second Escrow
Release Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing on or prior to
the Second Escrow Release Date. As soon as any such claims have been fully
resolved and satisfied, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Member the
remaining portion of the Escrow Account not required to satisfy any remaining
claims.

 

Section 7.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

(a) Buyer agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement
and without duplication, to indemnify the Member and its respective
Affiliates, officers, directors and employees (each a " _Member Indemnified
Party_ ") against and hold them harmless from all Losses resulting from: (i)
the breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained herein and
(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates contained herein or any of the other agreements entered into in
connection herewith.

(b) Except in the event of fraud, the indemnification obligations of Buyer
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ shall not be effective until the aggregate
dollar amount of all Losses that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant
to  _Section 7.3(a)(i)_: (i) exceeds the Deductible Amount, at which point
Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the Member Indemnified Parties against
and hold them harmless from all Losses to the extent such Losses exceed 0.25%
of the Closing Consideration, and (ii) does not exceed the Cap; provided,
however, that: (y) the Member shall have no obligation to provide any
indemnification for any individual claim or series of related claims for
Losses of less than $25,000 and (z) the Deductible Amount and the Cap shall
not apply to claims for breaches of _Section 4.1_. No indemnification shall
be payable to

 



64  a Member Indemnified Party with respect to claims asserted by such Member
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ after the Indemnification
Termination Date; provided, that in the event a claim has been properly made
on or prior to the Indemnification Termination Date, and such claim is
unresolved as of the Indemnification Termination Date, then the right to
indemnification with respect to such claim shall remain in effect until such
matter shall have been finally determined.

(c) For purposes of calculating Losses under this  _Section 7.3_ for any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant, any qualification
contained in such representation, warranty or covenant using words "material,"
"materially" or "material adverse effect" shall be disregarded and deemed not
to include such words. In no event shall the aggregate Losses recoverable by
the Member Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ exceed the
Consideration.

 

(d) The amount of any and all Losses recoverable under this _Section 7.3_
shall be determined net of any amounts actually recovered by any Member
Indemnified Party with respect thereto under or pursuant to any insurance
policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or
contract pursuant to which or under which such Member Indemnified Party is
a party or has rights.

(e) A Member Indemnified Party shall give Buyer written notice of any Action
by or in respect of a third party as to which such Member Indemnified Party
may request indemnification hereunder or as to which the Deductible Amount may
be applied as soon as is practicable. If the document evidencing such Action
is a court pleading, the Member Indemnified Party shall give such notice,
including a copy of such pleading, within 15 days of receipt of such pleading;
otherwise, it shall give such notice within 30 days of the date it receives
written notice of such Action; _provided, however_ , that the failure to
notify Buyer within such time periods shall not affect rights to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that Buyer is actually
prejudiced by such failure. Buyer shall notify the Member Indemnified Party
whether it elects to assume the defense of such Action within 20 days of the
Member Indemnified Partys notice of such Action. Failure by Buyer to so
notify the Member Indemnified Party shall be deemed an election by Buyer not
to assume the defense of such Action and a waiver by Buyer of any right to
assume such defense. If Buyer timely notifies the Member Indemnified Party
that it elects to assume the defense of such Action, it shall have the right
to direct, through counsel of its own choosing, the defense or settlement of
any such Action at its own expense; provided, it shall take all reasonable
steps necessary in such defense and shall hold Member Indemnified Parties, to
the extent provided in this _Section 7.3_, harmless from and against all
Losses arising out of or resulting from any settlement approved by Buyer or
any judgment in connection with such Action. Without limiting the foregoing,
if Buyer elects to assume the defense of any such Action:

 

(i) Buyer shall consult with the Member Indemnified Party for the purpose of
allowing the Member Indemnified Party to participate in such defense, but in
such case the expenses of the Member Indemnified Party shall be paid by the
Member Indemnified Party;

 



65 (ii) the Member Indemnified Party shall provide and shall cause the Member to
provide, as applicable, Buyer and counsel with access to its records and
personnel relating to any such Action during normal business hours and shall
otherwise cooperate with Buyer in the defense or settlement thereof, and Buyer
shall reimburse the Member Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out of
pocket expenses in connection therewith to the extent provided in this
_Section 7.3_;

(iii) the Member Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any
part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless Buyer
consents in writing to such payment; and 

(iv) Buyer shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Member
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to such Action if such settlement, compromise or
judgment (a) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing, (b) does not
include an unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the
Member Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Action or (c)
imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on the Member Indemnified Party
other than solely the payment of money damages for which the Member
Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder

If Buyer does not elect to assume such defense, fails to defend or if, after
commencing or undertaking any such defense, fails to prosecute or withdraws
from such defense, the Member Indemnified Party shall have the right to
undertake the defense or settlement thereof, and in such case, the Member
Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified hereunder to the extent provided in
this _Section 7.3_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if: (i)
defendants in any action include any of Member Indemnified Parties and Buyer,
and if any Member Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that
there may be material legal defenses available to such Member Indemnified
Party that are not available to Buyer or (ii) if a conflict of
interest exists between any Member Indemnified Party and Buyer with respect
to such claim or the defense thereof, then in either case, such Member
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in such
action, and in such case, the Member Indemnified Party shall be indemnified
hereunder for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel to the extent
provided in this _Section 7.3_.

(g) Each Member Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate
Losses for which indemnification may be claimed by them pursuant to this
Agreement upon and after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such Losses.

(h) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Buyer nor Buyer
Ultimate Parent shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement
for any punitive, special or exemplary damages. Any liability for
indemnification under this _Section 7.3_ shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise
to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



66 Section 7.4 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All payments made by the
Member or Buyer, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of the other
parties pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be treated as adjustments to the
Consideration for Tax purposes, and such agreed treatment shall govern for
purposes of this Agreement unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 7.5 _Remedies Exclusive_. From and after Closing, except in the
event of fraud, the rights of the parties to indemnification relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be strictly limited to
those contained in this _Article VII_ and such indemnification rights shall be
the exclusive remedies of the parties subsequent to the Closing Date with
respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in
connection herewith. Except in the event of fraud or as provided in this
_Article VII_ , no Action shall be brought or maintained by any party against
any other party and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of
them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misstatement or omission
respecting an inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of any of the parties hereto set forth or contained in
this Agreement.

Section 7.6 _Subrogation_. After any indemnification payment is made to any
indemnified party pursuant to this _Article VII_ , the indemnifying party
shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights, if any, of
the indemnified party against any third party in connection with the Losses
to which such payment relates. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, any indemnified party receiving an indemnification payment
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall execute, upon the written request of
the indemnifying party, any instrument reasonably necessary to evidence such
subrogation rights.

Section 9.2  _Disclosure Schedules_. The disclosure of any information in the
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such
information is material, nor shall such information be deemed to establish a
standard of materiality, nor shall it be deemed an admission of any liability
of, or concession as to any defense available to, Buyer, Buyer Ultimate
Parent, the Member or the Company, as applicable. The section number 

 



69  headings in the Schedules correspond to the section numbers in this
Agreement and any information disclosed in any section of the Schedules shall
be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated into any other section of the
Schedules to the extent that applicability of such disclosure to such other
section is appropriate and reasonably apparent on its face.

Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto, and any documents executed by the parties simultaneously
herewith or pursuant thereto, constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement (excluding the provisions of this Agreement), which shall survive
the execution of this Agreement and any termination of this Agreement.

Section 9.4 _No Other Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_.
No party hereto has made any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements, express or implied, of any nature whatsoever other than those
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

 

Section 9.5 _Amendment; Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified, nor may compliance with any condition or covenant set forth herein
be waived, except by a writing duly and validly executed by Buyer, Buyer
Ultimate Parent, the Company and the Member, or in the case of a waiver,
Buyer, Buyer Ultimate Parent or the Member, whoever is waiving
compliance. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by a party
shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or waiver of the
same term or condition by such party, or a waiver of any other term or
condition of this Agreement by such party.

Section 9.6 _Assignment_. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties.

Section 9.7 _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among

shall not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement,
arrangement or understanding among the parties hereto unless and until this
Agreement is executed by the parties hereto.

Section 9.8 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference will be to an Article or
Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms used herein with initial capital letters have the
meanings ascribed to them herein and all terms defined in this Agreement will
have such defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made
or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the 

 



70  singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein, or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein, means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly agreed herein,
as among the parties, Buyer and Buyer Ultimate Parent shall be solely liable
for all legal, financial advisory, accounting, investment banking and other
fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Buyer and Buyer Ultimate Parent
in connection with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this
Agreement and the performance or consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any such fees or expenses payable to Reinhart
Boerner Van Deuren s.c. or Fredericks Michael and Co. In the event
of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, the Member
shall be solely liable for all Transaction Expenses.

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflict of laws.

Section 9.11 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Disputes_.

(i) Unless and until the Closing occurs, each of the Company, Buyer, Buyer
Ultimate Parent, the Member hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Court_ ") for any litigation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to
commence any litigation relating thereto except in the Chosen Court), waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Chosen
Court and agrees not to plead or claim in the Chosen Court that
such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum.

(ii) Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not
otherwise subject to service of process in the state of Delaware, to appoint
and maintain an agent in the state of Delaware as such partys agent for
acceptance of legal process with respect to the litigation of matters
described in _Section 9.11(a)(i)_ and to provide notice to the other parties
hereto of such appointment and (b) that service of process may also be made on
such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service. Solely for purposes of implementing the parties agreement to appoint
and maintain an agent for service of process in the state of Delaware,
Buyer and Buyer Ultimate Parent do hereby appoint The Corporation Trust
Company, 1209 Orange Street in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, as such
agent.

 



71 (b) _Post-Closing Disputes_.

 

(i) If the Closing occurs, any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be resolved through
binding arbitration.

(ii) The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules.
The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator selected
by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot reach an
agreement, by AAA under its standard selection procedures. The arbitration
shall take place in New York, New York, or such other place as
mutually agreed by the parties. Reasonable discovery shall be permitted for
the production of documents and the taking of depositions for a reasonable
period after the filing of the request for arbitration. All discovery shall be
governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Any discovery disputes
shall be resolved by the arbitrator. Judgment on any arbitration award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. All fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the
parties equally. However, each party shall bear the expense of its own
counsel, experts, witnesses, and preparation and presentation of proof.
Neither party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or
results of any arbitration under this _Section 9.11_ without prior written
consent of both parties. This arbitration provision shall survive if this
Agreement should be adjudged null and void or should be canceled or terminated
for any reason. 

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen Court, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

 

Section 9.13 _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have
been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby
who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the
parties do not intend that the presumptions of Law relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular
clause should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
executed in connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

Section 9.14 _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement (a) shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefits of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns and (b) may be executed in two or more counterparts which
together shall constitute a single agreement. Each party hereto intends that
this Agreement shall not benefit or create any right or cause of action in or
on behalf of any Person other than the parties hereto.

 



72 Section 9.15 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby,
and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.

Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly
