                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of the 29th day of September 2002, by and among Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Anadarko"), Belair Merger Corp., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko ("Subcorp"), and
Howell Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Howell").

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

     A.  Anadarko desires to combine its businesses with the businesses operated
by Howell through the merger of Subcorp with and into Howell, with Howell as the
surviving corporation (the "Merger"), pursuant to which (i) each share of Howell
Common Stock (as defined in Section 4.4) issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.2), other than the shares of Howell Common Stock
owned by Anadarko, Subcorp or Howell (or any of their respective direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.3) other than as
described in Section 2.1(e)) and other than the Appraisal Shares (as defined in
Section 2.1(f)) will be converted into the right to receive in cash, without
interest, $20.75 per share of Howell Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration")
and (ii) each share of Howell Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined in Section
4.4) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time other than the shares of
Howell Convertible Preferred Stock owned by Anadarko, Subcorp or Howell (or any
of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries) and other than
the Appraisal Shares will be converted into the right to receive in cash,
without interest, $76.15 per share of Howell Convertible Preferred Stock (the
"Preferred Merger Consideration"), all as more fully provided in this Agreement.

     B.  The respective Boards of Directors of Anadarko, Subcorp and Howell have
determined the Merger in the manner contemplated in this Agreement to be
advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders, and, by
resolutions duly adopted, have approved and adopted this Agreement.

     C.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Anadarko's willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
holders of Howell Common Stock and Howell Convertible Preferred Stock are
entering into Support Agreements (as defined in Section 4.26) with Anadarko.

                                   AGREEMENT

     Now, therefore, in consideration of these premises and the mutual and
dependent promises hereinafter set forth, the parties to this Agreement agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1.  The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Subcorp shall be merged with and into Howell at
the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Subcorp shall cease and Howell shall continue its existence under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Howell, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the
Merger, is sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation".

     1.2.  Effective Time.  As promptly as possible on the Closing Date (as
defined below), the parties to this Agreement shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Delaware Secretary of State") a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section
251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of
Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time
as shall be agreed upon by Anadarko and Howell and specified in the Certificate
of Merger (the "Effective Time"). Prior to the filing referred to in this
Section 1.2, a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at the offices of Anadarko,
or such other place as the parties to this Agreement may agree, as soon as
practicable

                                       A-1
<PAGE>

following the date upon which all conditions set forth in Article VI that are
capable of being satisfied prior to the Closing have been satisfied or waived,
or at such other date as Anadarko and Howell may agree; provided that the
conditions set forth in Article VI that are capable of being satisfied prior to
the Closing have been satisfied or waived at or prior to such date, and
provided, further, that the Closing shall be delayed if and only for so long as
necessary if a banking moratorium, act of terrorism or war (whether or not
declared) affecting United States banking or financial markets generally
prevents the Closing (such date, the "Closing Date").

     1.3.  Effects of the Merger.  From and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

     1.4.  Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.  The Certificate of Merger
shall provide that, at the Effective Time, (a) the Surviving Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall continue as the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and (b) Subcorp's By-laws in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be Surviving Corporation's By-laws; in each case, until
amended in accordance with the DGCL.

     1.5.  Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.  From and after
the Effective Time, the officers of Subcorp immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, and the directors of
Subcorp immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified. On or prior to the Closing Date, Howell shall deliver to
Anadarko evidence satisfactory to Anadarko of the resignations of the directors
of Howell, such resignations to be effective as of the Effective Time.

     1.6.  Additional Actions.  If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to
(a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of Howell or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, Howell and the officers and directors of Howell shall be deemed to
have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney, and
the Surviving Corporation and the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized in the name of and on behalf of Howell, to
execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take
all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of Howell or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     2.1.  Effect on Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Anadarko, Subcorp or Howell or
their respective stockholders, as applicable:

          (a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Subcorp ("Subcorp
     Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of
     common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Except as provided in Section
     2.1(e), such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the
     issued and outstanding Surviving Corporation capital stock.

          (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of
     Howell Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time, excluding any shares of Howell Common Stock owned by
     Anadarko, Subcorp or Howell or any of their respective subsidiaries, shall
     be converted into and represent the right to receive in cash, without
     interest, an amount equal to the Merger Consideration. At the Effective
     Time, all shares of Howell Common Stock (other than shares owned by a
     subsidiary of Howell, which shares shall be converted into shares of the
     Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.1(e) of this Agreement) no
     longer shall be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall
     cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to
     the Effective Time

                                       A-2
<PAGE>

     represented any shares of Howell Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall cease
     to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
     Merger Consideration.

          (c) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of
     Howell Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
     to the Effective Time shall be converted into and represent the right to
     receive in cash, without interest, an amount equal to the Preferred Merger
     Consideration. At the Effective Time, all shares of Howell Convertible
     Preferred Stock no longer shall be outstanding and automatically shall be
     cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
     immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any shares of Howell
     Convertible Preferred Stock (a "Preferred Certificate") shall cease to have
     any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred
     Merger Consideration.

          (d) Each share of Howell capital stock held in the treasury of Howell
     automatically shall be cancelled and retired, and no payment shall be made
     in respect thereof.

          (e) Each share of Howell Common Stock owned by a subsidiary of Howell
     shall be converted into a number of shares of fully paid and nonassessable
     shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of
     (i) the number of shares of Subcorp Common Stock issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) a fraction, the numerator
     of which is one and the denominator of which is equal to the excess of (A)
     the sum of (I) the total number of shares of Howell Common Stock issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (II) the total
     number of shares of Howell Common Stock into which all shares of Howell
     Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible pursuant to their terms
     immediately prior to the Effective Time over (B) the total number of shares
     of Howell Common Stock owned by subsidiaries of Howell in the aggregate
     immediately prior to the Effective Time.

          (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
     shares of Howell Common Stock or Howell Convertible Preferred Stock issued
     and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by
     any Howell Stockholder that is entitled to demand and properly demands
     appraisal of shares of Howell Common Stock or Howell Convertible Preferred
     Stock, as the case may be, pursuant to, and that complies in all respects
     with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") (the
     "Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
     Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as the case may
     be, as provided in Section 2.1(b) or (c), respectively, but, instead, such
     Howell Stockholder shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights)
     as are granted by Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares
     shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and
     shall cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Laws
     (as defined in Section 2.2(d)), each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease
     to have any rights with respect to the Appraisal Shares other than such
     rights as are granted by Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
     such Howell Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect or shall otherwise
     waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or if a
     court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Howell
     Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
     rights of such Howell Stockholder under Section 262 shall cease, and such
     Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
     Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
     Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as the case may be, as
     provided in Section 2.1(b) or (c) respectively. Howell shall give prompt
     notice to Anadarko of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Howell
     Common Stock or Howell Convertible Preferred Stock, and Anadarko shall have
     the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
     respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Howell shall not,
     without the prior written consent of Anadarko, make any payment with
     respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do
     any of the foregoing.

     2.2.  Surrender and Payment.

     (a) Paying Agent.  Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of Howell Common Stock and Howell Convertible Preferred Stock (such
holders collectively, the "Howell Stockholders"), Anadarko shall designate, or
shall cause to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Anadarko), Mellon Investor Services or another bank or
trust company to act as agent for the

                                       A-3
<PAGE>

payment of the Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger Consideration in
respect of Certificates and Preferred Certificates, respectively, upon surrender
of Certificates and Preferred Certificates, respectively, in accordance with
this Article II from time to time after the Effective Time (the "Paying Agent").
Promptly after the Effective Time, Anadarko shall deposit, or cause Subcorp to
deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in amounts sufficient for the payment of the
Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger Consideration, pursuant to Section
2.1(b) and (c), respectively, upon surrender of the Certificates and Preferred
Certificates, respectively (such cash, the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Anadarko, on
a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from investments shall be
paid to Anadarko upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section
2.2(d).

     (b) Exchange Procedure.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or
more Certificates or Preferred Certificates (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates or the Preferred Certificates held by such Howell
Stockholder shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or the
Preferred Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other customary provisions as Anadarko may reasonably specify), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and the
Preferred Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Preferred
Merger Consideration, as the case may be. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a
Preferred Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Anadarko, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
or Preferred Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash into which the shares of Howell Common Stock or Howell
Convertible Preferred Stock, as the case may be, formerly represented by the
Certificate or the Preferred Certificate, respectively, shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or (c), respectively, and the Certificate
or the Preferred Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Howell Common Stock or Howell Convertible Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, that is not registered in the stock transfer books of
Howell, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate or the Preferred Certificate
so surrendered is registered if such Certificate or Preferred Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or the Preferred Certificate, as the case may be, or establish to the
satisfaction of Anadarko that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate or Preferred Certificate.

     (c) Stock Transfer Books.  At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of Howell shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Howell Common Stock or Howell
Convertible Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Preferred
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

     (d) No Liability.  None of Anadarko, Subcorp, Howell or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund held by the Paying Agent for payment to the
holders of unsurrendered Certificates and Preferred Certificates and unclaimed
four months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Anadarko, after which
time any holder of unsurrendered Certificates or Preferred Certificates shall
look as a general creditor only to Anadarko for payment of the funds which the
holder of unsurrendered Certificates or Preferred Certificates may be owed,
subject to Applicable Laws. If any Certificates or Preferred Certificates shall
not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, any
such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificates or
Preferred Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by all applicable laws,
statutes, orders, rules, regulations or policies promulgated by, or judgments,
decisions or orders entered by, any Governmental Authority (as defined in
Section 3.3(d)), in

                                       A-4
<PAGE>

each case, to the extent applicable (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), become
the property of Anadarko, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

     (e) Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate or Preferred Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming a Certificate or Preferred Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Anadarko or the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Anadarko or
the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate or Preferred
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in respect of the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate or Preferred Certificate, the Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Merger Consideration, respectively.

     (f) No Further Ownership Rights in Howell Common Stock.  The Merger
Consideration and the Preferred Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms of this Article II in respect of Certificates or Preferred Certificates,
as the case may be, that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Howell Common Stock or Howell Convertible
Preferred Stock represented thereby.

     (g) Withholding Rights.  Each of the Surviving Corporation and Anadarko
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct
and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Howell Stockholders such amounts as it may be required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the "Code"), or any provision of state or local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Anadarko, as the case may be, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Howell
Stockholders in respect of which the deduction and withholding were made by the
Surviving Corporation or Anadarko, as the case may be.

     2.3.  Treatment of Stock Options; Restricted Stock.

     (a) At the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised outstanding
option to purchase shares of Howell Common Stock issued or granted as of the
date of this Agreement under the Howell Stock Plans (as defined in Section 4.4),
whether or not vested or exercisable in accordance with its terms, which is
listed in Section 4.4 to the Howell Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Section
4.1) (each, a "Howell Option") will by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder of a Howell Option (each, a "Howell
Optionholder") be cancelled as of the Effective Time solely in exchange for the
right to receive as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time
an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Howell Common Stock subject to such Howell Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the amount by which (A) the
Merger Consideration exceeds (B) the exercise price per share of Howell Common
Stock subject to such Howell Option. Prior to the Effective Time, Howell shall
take any and all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 2.3(a).

     (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder of shares of Howell Restricted Stock (as defined in
Section 4.4), each share of Howell Restricted Stock, whether or not vested or
forfeitable in accordance with its terms, which is listed in Section 4.4 to the
Howell Disclosure Schedule (including the name of the stockholder, number of
shares of Howell Restricted Stock and vesting schedule with respect thereto)
shall automatically be cancelled solely in exchange for the right to receive as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time an amount in cash
(less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the Merger Consideration.

     (c) The Howell Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and
the provisions in any other Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant
of any capital stock of Howell or any interest in respect of any capital stock
of Howell (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) shall be
deleted as of the Effective Time, and Howell shall ensure that following the
Effective Time no holder of a Howell Option or any participant in any Howell
Stock Plan or other Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital
stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of Howell or
the Surviving Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HOWELL

     In order to induce Subcorp and Anadarko to enter into this Agreement,
Howell hereby represents and warrants to Anadarko and Subcorp that the
statements contained in this Article IV are true, correct and complete.

     4.1.  Organization and Standing.  Howell is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
with full corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its
properties and to conduct its businesses as and where now owned, leased, used,
operated and conducted. Each of Howell's subsidiaries is an organization duly
incorporated, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation with full corporate power and authority to own,
lease, use and operate its properties and to conduct its businesses as and where
now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted. Howell and each of its
subsidiaries are duly qualified to do business and are in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the property
it owns, leases or operates requires it to so qualify, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing in such jurisdiction would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Howell. Howell is not in default in the performance,
observance or fulfillment of any provision of Howell's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, including the Howell Certificate of Designations (as
defined in Section 4.4), as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Howell
Certificate") or Howell's By-laws, as amended, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (the "Howell By-laws"), and none of Howell's subsidiaries is in
default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision of its
certificate of incorporation or by-laws. Howell has heretofore made available to
Anadarko in written form complete and correct copies of the Howell Certificate
and the Howell By-laws and the certificates of incorporation and by-laws for
each of its subsidiaries. Section 4.1 to the disclosure schedule delivered by
Howell to Anadarko and dated the date of this Agreement (the "Howell Disclosure
Schedule") sets forth a true and accurate list of each jurisdiction in which
Howell or any of its subsidiaries is qualified to do business and discloses
whether Howell (or any of its subsidiaries) is in good standing in such
jurisdiction.

     4.2.  Subsidiaries.  Except as set forth in Section 4.2 to the Howell
Disclosure Schedule, Howell owns, directly or indirectly, each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock (or other securities having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of directors or others performing
similar functions with respect to such subsidiary) of each of its subsidiaries,
all of which are in corporate form. Howell does not own, directly or indirectly,
any equity or other ownership interest in any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other entity or enterprise, except for the subsidiaries set forth in
Section 4.2 to the Howell Disclosure Schedule, and other interests which (i) are
immaterial in amount, (ii) are immaterial to the businesses or operations of
Howell or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) are immaterial to the ownership of
assets of Howell or any of its subsidiaries, and (iv) do not give rise to
liabilities or obligations of, or restrictions on, Howell or any of its
subsidiaries, except for those liabilities or obligations or restrictions which
are immaterial. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 to the Howell Disclosure
Schedule and except for nominal amounts due to electrical cooperatives, Howell
is not subject to any obligation or requirement to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan,

                                       A-7
<PAGE>

capital contribution or otherwise) in any such entity or any other person. Each
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of Howell's subsidiaries is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and is owned,
directly or indirectly, by Howell free and clear of all liens, pledges, security
interests, claims or other encumbrances. The following information for each of
Howell's subsidiaries is set forth in Section 4.2 to the Howell Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable: (a) its name and jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization; (b) its authorized capital stock or share capital; and (c) the
number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or share capital and
the record owner(s) thereof. Other than as set forth in Section 4.2 to the
Howell Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, phantom stock rights, stock appreciation rights,
stock-based performance units, agreements, understandings, claims or other
commitments or rights of any type relating to the issuance, sale or transfer of
any securities of any of Howell's subsidiaries or that give any person or entity
the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to or derived from
the economic benefits or rights of the capital stock of one or more subsidiaries
of Howell, nor are there outstanding any securities that are convertible into or
exchangeable for any shares of capital stock of any of Howell's subsidiaries,
and neither Howell nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligation of any kind to
issue any additional securities or to pay for or repurchase any securities of
any of Howell's subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof.

     4.3.  Corporate Power and Authority.  Howell has all requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, and, subject to adoption of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the holders of Howell Common
Stock, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Howell have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of Howell, subject to adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
holders of Howell Common Stock. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Howell, and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Howell enforceable against Howell in accordance with its terms.

     4.4.  Capitalization of Howell.  (a) As of the date of this Agreement,
Howell's authorized capital stock consisted solely of (a) 50,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Howell Common Stock"), of which (i)
6,499,210 shares were issued and outstanding (excluding the shares set forth in

pursuant to Howell's 1988 Stock Option Plan, Omnibus Stock Awards and Incentive

"Howell Convertible Preferred Stock") pursuant to the Certificate of
Designations dated April 19, 1993 (the "Howell Certificate of Designations"),
were issued and outstanding. Except as specified in the preceding sentence, no
shares of capital stock of Howell were authorized or were issued and outstanding

understanding. The "Conversion Price" for each share of Howell Convertible
Preferred Stock, within the meaning of Section 3(b) of the Howell Certificate of

Certificate of Designations, is $13.64.

     (b) Each outstanding share of Howell capital stock is duly authorized and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and has not been issued in
violation of any preemptive or similar rights. Other than as set forth in the
first sentence of this Section 4.4, or in Section 4.4 to the Howell Disclosure
Schedule, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, phantom stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance
units, agreements, understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any
type granted or entered into by Howell or any of its subsidiaries relating to
the issuance, sale, repurchase or transfer

                                       A-8
<PAGE>

of any securities of Howell or that give any person or entity the right to
receive any economic benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic
benefits and rights of capital stock of Howell, nor are there outstanding any
securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Howell
capital stock, and neither Howell nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligation
of any kind to issue any additional securities or to pay for or repurchase any
securities of Howell or any predecessor. Except as set forth in Section 4.4 to

the date, price, quantity and, if known, identity of the selling stockholder,
and (ii) the aggregate repurchases of shares of Howell capital stock in 2001,

the Howell Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth the names of, and number of
shares of Howell Restricted Stock held by, all holders of shares of Howell
Restricted Stock (including the vesting schedule with respect thereto). Except

copies of any such registration rights or similar agreements previously have
been provided to Anadarko.

     4.5.  Conflicts; Consents and Approvals.  Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Howell, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will:

          (a) conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, the
     Howell Certificate or the Howell By-laws or the certificate of
     incorporation or by-laws of any of Howell's subsidiaries;

          (b) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision

     entitle any person (with the giving of notice, the passage of time or
     otherwise) to terminate, accelerate, modify or call a default under, or
     result in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or

     regulation applicable to Howell or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
     respective properties or assets; or

          (d) require any action or consent or approval of, or review by, or
     registration or filing by Howell or any of its subsidiaries with, any third

prescribed by Applicable Laws, paid or, prior to the Effective Time, will pay
all Taxes required to be paid in respect of the periods covered by such Tax

for the 2001 tax year, none of Howell or any of its subsidiaries has requested
or filed any document having the effect of causing any extension of time within

deficiencies are set forth in Section 4.12(a) to the Howell Disclosure Schedule.
Except as set forth in Section 4.12(a) to the Howell Disclosure Schedule and

closed with respect to all United States federal and material state income tax
returns of Howell and its subsidiaries for all years through December 31, 1998.
Neither Howell nor any of its subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations
in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
assessment or deficiency which waiver or agreement to extension of time has not
expired. All assessments for taxes due and owing by Howell or any of its
subsidiaries with respect to completed and settled examinations or concluded
litigation have been timely paid. There are no liens with respect to Taxes upon
any of the properties or assets, real or personal, tangible or intangible of
Howell or any of its subsidiaries (other than liens for Taxes not yet due). No
claim has ever been made in writing by an authority in a jurisdiction where none
of Howell and any

                                       A-11
<PAGE>

for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior
to the date of this Agreement (or will constitute such a corporation in the two
years prior to the Closing Date) or (ii) in a distribution that otherwise
constitutes part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.

     (e) Howell and its subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates have
complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations (including any local
Applicable Laws) applicable to the Plans. Each Plan has been operated in all
material respects in accordance with its terms. There is not now, and there are
no existing circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to, any
requirement for the posting of security with respect to a Plan or the imposition

their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has
not been satisfied in full.

subsidiaries has any material liability for life, health, medical or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof. To
the knowledge of Howell, there has been no communication to employees of Howell
or its subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected or interpreted to promise
or guarantee such employees retiree health or life insurance benefits or other
retiree death benefits on a permanent basis.

     (i) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(i) to the Howell Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in,

Actions (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) that have been
asserted or instituted against any Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to any Plan or the assets of any of the trusts under any Plan that
could reasonably

                                       A-14
<PAGE>

be expected to result in any material liability of Howell or any of its
subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the United States
Department of Treasury, the United States Department of Labor or any
Multiemployer Plan.

     (k) Section 4.15(k) to the Howell Disclosure Schedule sets forth the names
of all directors and officers of Howell and any increase or change in the total
salary, bonus, and fringe benefits and perquisites (to the extent such fringe

executive officer) each will be eligible to receive for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2002 as compared to the amounts thereof which are disclosed in

other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited

4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

     (m) No Plan is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the

Disclosure Schedule also describes each termination or nonrenewal (excluding any

customer involving payments reasonably expected to be in excess of $250,000 for
the 2002 calendar year or with any customer that made payments in excess of
$250,000 during any of the three calendar years ending December 31, 2001.

     4.20.  Permits; Compliance.  Except as to environmental matters (as to
which representations and warranties have been made in Section 4.21), Howell and
its subsidiaries are in possession of all material franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents,

or, to the knowledge of Howell, threatened, regarding any of the Howell Permits.
Howell is in material compliance with the Howell Permits.

     4.21.  Environmental Matters.  Except as disclosed in Section 4.21 to the
Howell Disclosure Schedule, (a) the properties, operations and activities of
Howell and its subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Law (as defined below) and all past noncompliance of
Howell or any of its subsidiaries with any Environmental Law or Environmental
Permits (as defined below) has been

                                       A-17
<PAGE>

resolved without any pending or, to the knowledge of Howell, future material
cost or liability to Howell or any of its subsidiaries; (b) Howell and its

chemicals, contaminants, or industrial, toxic, hazardous or radioactive
substances, wastes or other pollutants (including petroleum or petroleum
distillates, asbestos or asbestos-containing material) regulated by

subsidiaries in connection with their current or former properties or operations
for which Howell or any of its subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to
incur material liability under Environmental Law; and (d) there has been no

current or former properties, operations and activities of Howell and its
subsidiaries other than those the consequences of which would not be material to
Howell or any of its subsidiaries. "Release" means any actual or threatened

     4.22.  Accounts Receivable.  All accounts and notes receivable of Howell
and any of its subsidiaries represent valid obligations arising from sales
actually made or services actually performed and have arisen in the ordinary
course of business, and the accounts receivable reserve reflected in the balance
sheet of Howell as of December 31, 2001 included in the Howell SEC Documents is
as of such date adequate and established in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied. Since December 31, 2001, to the knowledge of Howell there has been no
event or occurrence that, when considered individually or together with all such
other events or occurrences, would cause such accounts receivable reserve to be
inadequate, and that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Howell.

     4.23.  Insurance.  Except as set forth in Section 4.23 to the Howell
Disclosure Schedule, each of Howell and its subsidiaries is, and has been
continuously since January 1, 1998, insured with financially responsible
insurers or under other financially responsible arrangements in such amounts and
against such risks and losses as are customary for companies engaged in a
similar business and acting in accordance with good business practice. Howell's
and its subsidiaries' insurance policies are in all material respects in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, no notice of cancellation has
been received, and there is no existing default or event that, with the giving
of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder; all
premiums thereunder to date have been paid in full. Set forth in Section 4.23 to
the Howell Disclosure Schedule is the amount of the annual premium currently
paid by Howell and its subsidiaries for its directors' and officers' liability
insurance.

received the written opinion of BMO Nesbitt Burns, Howell's financial advisor,
to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be
received by Howell Stockholders pursuant to the Merger is fair to Howell
Stockholders from a financial point of view, Howell has provided a copy of such
opinion to Anadarko, and such opinion has not been withdrawn or revoked or
otherwise modified. Howell has received the consent of BMO Nesbitt Burns to
include such written opinion in the Proxy Statement.

     4.25.  Board Recommendation; Required Vote.  The Board of Directors of
Howell, at a meeting duly called and held, has, by unanimous vote of those
directors present (who constituted 100% of the directors then in office), (a)
approved this Agreement, and deem this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of Howell Stockholders; (b) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, in all
respects, and such approval constitutes approval of this Agreement, the Merger
and the Support Agreements for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL; and (c)

this Agreement, including the Merger (the "Howell Board Recommendation"). The

                                       A-18
<PAGE>

class or series of Howell capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

Board of Directors of Howell has taken all action necessary to exempt under or
make not subject to (a) the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL and (b) any

execution of this Agreement and the Support/ Voting Agreements, dated as of the
date hereof, between Anadarko and certain Howell Stockholders (collectively, the
"Support Agreements"), (ii) the Merger, and (iii) the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Support Agreements.

with the other parties to this Agreement in connection with any such filing, if
applicable (including, with respect to the party to this Agreement making a
filing, providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties to this

reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith)
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such

Section 5.1(a)(ii)) with respect to any such filing or any such transaction.
Each party hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to
any Applicable Laws in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the
other parties hereto of any communication with, and any proposed understanding,
undertaking, or agreement with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such
filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate
in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry
without giving the other party hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR
Act, if applicable, or other Antitrust Laws. Anadarko and Howell may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 5.1 for review by "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the

the materials (Anadarko or Howell, as the case may be) or its legal counsel,
provided, however, that materials concerning the valuation of Howell may be
redacted.

     (ii) Each of Anadarko and Howell shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by

<PAGE>

as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to

monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In
connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Antitrust Laws, each of Anadarko and Howell shall cooperate
and use commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any
such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,
that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal
and all available legislative action unless, by mutual agreement, Anadarko and
Howell decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing
in this Section 5.1(a) shall limit a party hereto's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, so long as such party hereto has, up to then,
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section
5.1(a).

     (iii) Each of the parties hereto agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (A) the obtaining of all other
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits,
authorizations, orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the
making of all other necessary registrations and filings (including other filings
with Governmental Authorities, if any), (B) the obtaining of all consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties related to or required in connection
with the Merger that are necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect
on Howell from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time, (C) the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and (D) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, and, unless prohibited
by Applicable Laws, the providing of all such information concerning such party,
its subsidiaries, its affiliates and its subsidiaries' officers, directors,
employees and partners as may be reasonably requested in connection with any of
the matters set forth in this subclause (iii).

     (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A)
neither Anadarko nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their respective
businesses or assets (including, following the Effective Time, any of the
businesses or assets of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries), or to
take or agree to take any action or agree to any limitation with respect to the
ownership or holding of any of their respective businesses or assets (including,
following the Effective Time, any of the businesses or assets of the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries), (B) prior to the Effective Time, neither
Howell nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to hold separate (including

assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation
with respect to the ownership or holding of any of their respective businesses
or assets, (C) neither any party hereto nor their respective subsidiaries shall
be required to take any action that would, or could reasonably be expected to,
substantially impair the benefits expected, as of the date of this Agreement, to
be realized by Anadarko from consummation of the Merger, and (D) no party to
this Agreement shall be required to waive any of the conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article VI as they apply to such party to this Agreement.

     (b) Public Announcements.  Unless otherwise required by Applicable Laws or
requirements of the NYSE (and, in that event, only if time does not permit), at
all times prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, Howell and Anadarko shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall use all reasonable
efforts not to issue any such press release prior to such consultation.

<PAGE>

     (c) Obligations of Anadarko and Howell.  Whenever this Agreement requires
any of Anadarko's subsidiaries (including Subcorp) to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Anadarko to
cause such subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires any
of Howell's subsidiaries to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Howell to cause such subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Anadarko and the
Surviving Corporation to cause such subsidiary to take such action.

     (d) Conveyance Taxes.  Howell and Anadarko shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees, and any similar Taxes that become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.

     5.2.  Covenants of Anadarko.

     (a) Information for the Preparation of the Proxy Statement.  Anadarko shall
promptly furnish Howell with all information concerning it as may be required
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. Anadarko shall cooperate with Howell in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, Anadarko shall obtain knowledge of any information pertaining to Anadarko
contained in or omitted from the Proxy Statement that would require an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, Anadarko will so advise Howell in writing.
Anadarko shall promptly furnish to Howell all information concerning it as may
be required for supplementing the Proxy Statement. Anadarko shall use all
reasonable efforts to assist Howell in clearing the Proxy Statement with the
Staff of the Commission.

     (b) Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

     (i) From and after the Effective Time, Anadarko shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of Howell (each an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time and including actions and omissions in respect of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the
"Indemnified Liabilities")) to the extent provided under the Howell Certificate
or the Howell By-laws. Each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to the
advancement of expenses to the extent provided under the Howell Certificate or
the Howell By-laws in connection with any such action; provided, however, that
any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification;

     (ii) Anadarko shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance
with their respective terms the indemnification agreements set forth in Section
5.2(b) to the Howell Disclosure Schedule, complete and correct copies of which
have been provided to Anadarko prior to the execution of this Agreement; and

     (iii) Anadarko shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving
Corporation or Anadarko to obtain and maintain in effect, for a period of six
years after the Effective Time, from Howell's current insurers or others,
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance at no cost to the
beneficiaries thereof with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain substantially the same
coverage and substantially similar terms and conditions as existing policies;
provided, however, that neither the Surviving Corporation nor Anadarko shall be
required to pay an aggregate premium for such insurance coverage in respect of
any policy year which is in excess of 150% of the amount paid in respect of the
policy year ending August 10, 2003 for such insurance coverage set forth in
Section 4.23 to the Howell Disclosure Schedule, but, in such case, shall
purchase the best available coverage which it determines is reasonably available
for such amount.

     (c) Employee Benefit Matters.

     (i) For purposes hereof, "Affected Employees" shall mean those individuals
who are employees of Howell and its subsidiaries (including those employees who
are on vacation, leave of absence, disability or maternity leave) as of the
Effective Time.

                                       A-21
<PAGE>

     (ii) Anadarko shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give the
Affected Employees credit, for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting, but not for accrual of benefits, under any employee welfare benefit
plans (other than for purposes of retiree welfare benefit plans), including,
without limitation, such plans as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, maintained
by Anadarko, the Surviving Corporation and their respective subsidiaries for the
Affected Employees' service with Howell and its subsidiaries to the same extent
recognized by Howell and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time in any Plans in which such Affected Employees participate immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

     (iii) Anadarko shall cause the Surviving Corporation to waive or continue
to waive any preexisting-condition exclusions to coverage, any
evidence-of-insurability requirements, and any waiting-period requirements, with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees under any employee welfare benefit plans in which such employees may
be eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the extent waived under
substantially similar Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided
that, with respect to participation in any employee welfare benefit plan of
Anadarko after the Effective Time, the Affected Employee must enroll within
thirty-one days of first eligibility.

     (iv) Anadarko shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give the
Affected Employees credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for
accrual of benefits, under any employee pension benefit plans, as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA, maintained by Anadarko and its subsidiaries.

     (v) Anadarko currently intends to cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide benefits to each employee of Howell and its subsidiaries who continues
employment with the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries after the
Effective Time that are no less favorable in the aggregate to such employees
than the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Anadarko and its
subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall be construed as (i) guaranteeing any Affected
Employee the right to continued employment following the Effective Time or (ii)
limiting Anadarko's right to amend, modify or terminate any Plan, in which
Affected Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time
(except as provided in clause (vi) below).

     (vi) Anadarko hereby agrees to honor, as of the Effective Time, the
provisions of Howell's: Severance Program for Executives; Retention and
Severance Program for Employees Not Based in Houston, Texas; Retention and
Severance Program for Employees Based in Houston, Texas; Retention and Severance
Program for Key Employees -- Field; and Retention and Severance Program for Key
Employees -- Non-Field, as each is attached to Sections 5.2(c)(vi)(1),
5.2(c)(vi)(2), 5.2(c)(vi)(3), 5.2(c)(vi)(4) and 5.2(c)(vi)(5), respectively, to
the Howell Disclosure Schedule.

     (vii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Howell shall amend as of the
Effective Time its 401(k) Plan and Trust to provide that, notwithstanding any
vesting schedule therein, all contributions made to such plan, whether made by
Howell or by the participants, and all earnings thereon shall be fully vested
(non-forfeitable) to the participants and shall no longer be subject to the
vesting schedule contained therein.

     5.3.  Covenants of Howell.

     (a) Howell Stockholders Meeting.  Howell shall take all action in
accordance with the United States federal securities laws, the DGCL, the Howell

convene and hold a special meeting of the holders of Howell Common Stock (the
"Howell Stockholders Meeting") to be held on the earliest practicable date
determined in consultation with Anadarko to consider and vote upon approval of
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Anadarko the Howell Board Recommendation. Howell shall ensure that the Howell
Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that
all proxies solicited in connection with the Howell

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Howell agrees that its

the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Howell Board Recommendation,

not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Howell of any Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 5.3(d)).

     (b) Preparation of the Proxy Statement.  Howell shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, prepare the proxy statement to be filed with the
Commission in connection with the Howell Stockholders Meeting (the "Proxy
Statement") and shall file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the Commission
as promptly as practical, but in no event later than 15 days after the date of
this Agreement. Howell shall cooperate with Anadarko in the preparation and
filing of the Proxy Statement with the Commission. Howell shall use its best
efforts to get clearance for the Proxy Statement by the Commission as soon as is
practicable. Consistent with the timing for the Howell Stockholders Meeting, as
determined in consultation with Anadarko, Howell shall use its best efforts to
mail at the earliest practicable date to the holders of Howell Common Stock the
Proxy Statement, which Proxy Statement shall include all information required

connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and shall include the Howell Board Recommendation to the extent not previously
withdrawn in compliance with Section 5.3(d) and the full text of the written
opinion of BMO Nesbitt Burns described in Section 4.24. Prior to filing or

shall provide Anadarko reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and (ii) shall accept all reasonable comments proposed by
Anadarko.

     (c) Conduct of Howell's Operations.  During the term of this Agreement,
Howell shall conduct its operations in the ordinary course, except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain
and preserve its business organization and its material rights and franchises
and to retain the services of its officers and key employees and maintain
relationships with customers, suppliers, lessees, joint venture partners,
licensees and other third parties, and to maintain all of its operating assets
in their current condition, normal wear and tear excepted under the
circumstances of their use to the end that their goodwill and ongoing business
shall not be impaired in any material respect. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, during the term of this Agreement, Howell shall not, except as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in Section
5.3(c) to the Howell Disclosure Schedule, without the prior written consent of

     person any right or option to acquire any shares of Howell capital stock or
     that of its subsidiaries, (D) issue, deliver or sell or agree to issue,

     to the exercise in accordance with their terms of Howell Options that are
     outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or upon conversion of the
     Howell Convertible Preferred Stock) or the capital stock or such securities
     or obligations of its

encourage or facilitate, or furnish or disclose nonpublic information in
furtherance of, any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any

Howell, or acquisition of any capital stock (other than upon exercise of Howell
Options that are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or conversion of
the Howell Convertible Preferred Stock) or a material amount of the assets of

                                       A-25
<PAGE>

Howell and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions, or any acquisition by Howell of any material
assets or capital stock of any other person, or any combination of the foregoing
(a "Competing Transaction"), or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in
discussions with any person (other than Anadarko, Subcorp or their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) with respect to any
Competing Transaction or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, at any time prior to
the approval of the Merger by the holders of Howell Common Stock, Howell may
furnish information to, and negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with,
any person that delivers a written proposal for a Competing Transaction that was
not solicited or encouraged after the date of this Agreement if and so long as
the Board of Directors of Howell determines in good faith by a majority vote,
after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, that failing to take
such action would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Laws and determines that such a proposal is, after consulting with BMO Nesbitt
Burns (or any other reputable investment banking firm), more favorable to Howell
Stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking
into consideration any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by
Anadarko in response to such Competing Transaction) (a "Superior Proposal");
provided, further, that, prior to furnishing any information to such person,
Howell shall enter into a confidentiality agreement that is no less restrictive
than the confidentiality agreement between Anadarko and Howell, dated May 13,
2002 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Howell will immediately cease all
existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any persons conducted on
or prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any proposal for a
Competing Transaction and request the return or destruction of all confidential
information regarding Howell provided to any such persons on or prior to the
date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreements
or otherwise. In the event that, prior to the approval of the Merger by the
holders of Howell Common Stock, the Board of Directors of Howell receives a
Superior Proposal that was not solicited or encouraged after the date of this
Agreement and the Board of Directors of Howell is advised by outside legal
counsel that failure to do so would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors of Howell under Applicable Laws, the Board of
Directors of Howell may (subject to this and the following sentences) withdraw,
modify or change, in a manner adverse to Anadarko, the Howell Board
Recommendation and/or comply with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect
to a Competing Transaction, provided that Howell gives Anadarko five business
days' prior written notice of its intention to do so (provided that the
foregoing shall in no way limit or otherwise affect Anadarko's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)). Any such withdrawal,
modification or change of the Howell Board Recommendation shall not change the
approval of the Board of Directors of Howell for purposes of causing any state
takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger or the Support Agreements,
or change the obligation of Howell to present this Agreement for adoption at the
duly called Howell Stockholders Meeting on the earliest practicable date
determined in consultation with Howell. From and after the execution of this
Agreement, Howell shall as promptly as practicable advise Anadarko in writing of
the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions,
negotiations, or proposals relating to a Competing Transaction (including the
specific terms thereof and the identity of the other person or persons involved)
and promptly furnish to Anadarko a copy of any such written proposal in addition
to any information provided to or by any third party relating thereto. In
addition, Howell shall as promptly as practicable advise Anadarko, in writing,
if the Board of Directors of Howell shall make any determination as to any
Competing Transaction as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of
this Section 5.3(d).

     (e) Howell Convertible Preferred Stock.  Howell shall, in accordance with
securities laws and the DGCL, provide to the holders of Howell Convertible
Preferred Stock the notice required under Section 3(h) of the Howell Certificate
of Designations.

     (f) Access.  Howell shall permit representatives of Anadarko to have access
at all reasonable times to Howell's premises, properties, assets, books,
records, Tax Returns, contracts, documents, commitments, directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, accountants, auditors, other advisors and other
representatives, shall use reasonable efforts to make available to Anadarko
Howell's customers, suppliers and co-venturers, and shall make available to
Anadarko on a prompt basis all information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as Anadarko may reasonably request (including the work papers of
Deloitte & Touche LLP if

                                       A-26
<PAGE>

reasonably available). Anadarko will keep the information obtained pursuant to
this Section 5.3(f) confidential pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, except as may otherwise be required by Applicable Laws. No
investigation conducted pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in this Agreement.

     (g) Advice of Changes; Subsequent Financial Statements.  Howell shall (i)
confer with Anadarko on a regular and frequent basis to report on operational
matters and other matters reasonably requested by Anadarko and (ii) promptly
advise Anadarko orally and in writing of any state of facts, change,
development, effect, condition, result, consequence, occurrence or circumstance
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Howell or a material adverse effect on the
ability of Howell to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or to cause a condition to the Merger set forth in Article VI not to be
satisfied; provided, however, that no such advice shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. Howell shall
consult with Anadarko prior to making publicly available its financial results
after the date of this Agreement and a reasonable time prior to filing any
Howell SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

Closing Date (except for representations and warranties made as of a specified
date, the accuracy of which will be determined as of the specified date),
except, in the cases of clauses (i) and (ii), where any such failure of the

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Howell or a material

the representations and warranties in the aggregate to be true and correct in
all respects would not prevent Anadarko and Subcorp from consummating the
Merger.

and agreement and shall have complied in all material respects with each
covenant to be performed and complied with by it under this Agreement at or

                                  ARTICLE VII
                           TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     7.1.  Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any approval
of this Agreement by the holders of Howell Common Stock):

          (a) by mutual written consent of Anadarko and Howell;

          (b) by either Anadarko or Howell if there shall be any law or
     regulation that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise
     prohibited, or if there shall be entered any judgment, injunction, order or
     decree of a court or other competent Governmental Authority enjoining
     Anadarko or Howell from

                                       A-28
<PAGE>

     consummating the Merger and such judgment, injunction, order or decree
     shall have become final and nonappealable;

          (c) by either Anadarko or Howell if the Merger shall not have been
     consummated by February 28, 2003, provided that termination pursuant to
     this Section 7.1(c) shall not be permitted prior to the 60th day following
     the date the Proxy Statement is cleared by the Commission unless such
     clearance is not obtained by May 31, 2003; provided further, however, that
     the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not
     be available to any party to this Agreement whose failure or whose
     affiliate's failure to perform any covenant or obligation under this
     Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to
     occur on or before such date;

          (d) by Anadarko if the Board of Directors of Howell shall withdraw,
     modify or change the Howell Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to
     Anadarko, if the Board of Directors of Howell approves or recommends any
     Competing Transaction, or if the Board of Directors of Howell shall have
     refused to affirm the Howell Board Recommendation within five business days
     of any written request from Anadarko;

          (e) by Anadarko or Howell if, at the Howell Stockholders Meeting
     (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), the requisite vote of
     the holders of Howell Common Stock to adopt this Agreement and to approve
     the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not
     have been obtained; or

          (f) by Anadarko or Howell if there shall have been a material breach
     by the other of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
     agreements contained in this Agreement which would result in the conditions
     to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied, and such breach
     shall not have been cured within 30 days after notice thereof shall have
     been received by the party to this Agreement claimed to be in breach.

     7.2.  Effect of Termination.  In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement, except for the provisions of
the second sentence of Section 5.3(f) and the provisions of this Section 7.2 and
Section 8.11, shall become void and have no effect, without any liability on the
part of any party to this Agreement or its directors, officers, or stockholders,
as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.2
shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for a material breach of
any provision of this Agreement and provided, further, however, that, if it
shall be judicially determined that termination of this Agreement was caused by
an intentional breach of this Agreement, then, in addition to other remedies at
law or equity for breach of this Agreement, the party to this Agreement so found
to have intentionally breached this Agreement shall indemnify and hold harmless
the other parties to this Agreement for their respective out-of-pocket costs,
fees and expenses of their counsel, accountants, financial advisors and other
experts and advisors as well as fees and expenses incident to negotiation,
