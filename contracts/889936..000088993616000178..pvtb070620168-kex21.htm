AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 29, 2016 (this "Agreement"), by
and among CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE, a Canadian chartered bank
("Parent"), PRIVATEBANCORP, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), and CIBC
HOLDCO INC., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Holdco").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Company and Holdco have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which Company will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Holdco (the "Merger"), so
that Holdco is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in
such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger;

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement is
intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition of Parent's willingness to enter
into this Agreement, concurrently with the entry of the parties into this
Agreement, Larry D. Richman is entering into an employment agreement with
Parent; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the
Effective Time, Company shall merge with and into Holdco. Holdco shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company shall terminate.

1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York
City time, at the offices of Mayer Brown LLP, on a date which shall be no
later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only
be satisfied at the 

Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof) unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and Company. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date".

1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on
or before the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the "Effective Time").

1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.5 Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Holdco, Company or
the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of the common stock, without par value, of Company issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Common
Stock") (except for (x) shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company as
treasury stock or owned by Company or Parent (in each case other than shares
of Company Common Stock (A) held in any Company Benefit Plans or related trust
accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or (B) held, directly or indirectly, in respect
of a debt previously contracted (collectively, the "Exception Shares")), (y)
Dissenting Shares and (z) Company Restricted Share Awards) shall be converted,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right
to receive without interest, (i) 0.3657 common shares (the "Exchange Ratio")
of Parent (the "Parent Common Shares") and (ii) $18.80 in cash (the "Per Share
Cash Consideration") (the consideration described in clauses (i) and (ii), the
"Merger Consideration").

(b) All the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an "Old Certificate", it
being understood that any reference herein to "Old Certificate" shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and
Section 2.3(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.3(b). If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common
Shares shall have been increased, decreased, or changed into or exchanged for
a different number or kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution,
an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be 

made to the Merger Consideration to give holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Company
or Parent (in each case other than the Exception Shares) shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

1.6 Parent Common Shares. At and after the Effective Time, each Parent Common
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Parent and shall
not be affected by the Merger.

1.7 Surviving Corporation Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each
share of the common stock of Holdco issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

1.8 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted by Company under a Company Stock Plan (as defined below) that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
"Company Stock Option") shall be converted automatically into an option (an
"Adjusted Stock Option") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including vesting terms), the number of Parent Common Shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) the
Exchange Ratio and (B) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained
by dividing (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration by (y) the Parent Share
Closing Price (clause (ii) hereof, the "Equity Award Exchange Ratio"), which
Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent Common Share
equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by
dividing (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (2) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Stock
Plans" means the Company Incentive Compensation Plan, the Company Strategic
Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company 2007 Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Plan, and the Company Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Compensation Plan.

(b) At the Effective Time, each award of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a
Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a "Company Restricted Stock Award") shall be cancelled and
replaced with a restricted stock award of Parent Common Shares (an "Adjusted
Restricted Stock Award") with the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including vesting terms), and relating to the number of Parent Common
Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company 

Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
(ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to
the next whole number of shares.

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award") shall (i) if unvested, be converted automatically into a
cash-settled restricted stock unit award (an "Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit
Award") with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including vesting terms), except that settlement shall be in the form of a
cash payment equal to the fair market value (determined under the methodology
used by Parent for determining fair market value for employee equity awards
generally) of the Parent Common Shares to which the award relates, and
relating to the number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product (taken to
the fourth decimal place) of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, or (ii) if
vested (including for this purpose all Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards
held by non-employee directors, whether or not vested as of date hereof, all
of which shall be vested and settled within ten (10) days after the Effective
Time pursuant to this clause (ii)), be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not later
than ten (10) days) after the Effective Time, (A) a cash payment equal to the
sum of (1) the Per Share Cash Consideration plus (2) the product of the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Share Closing Price (such sum, the
"Per Unit Total Consideration") (without interest and less applicable Tax
withholding) in respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying such
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award and (B) a cash payment equal to all
dividend equivalents accumulated with respect to such Company Restricted Stock
Unit Award that have not been paid prior to the Effective Time; provided, that
if the terms of any such vested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award do not
provide for settlement upon a change in control, such vested Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award shall instead be converted into an Adjusted
Restricted Stock Unit Award pursuant to clause (i) above and shall be settled
at the earliest time provided by its terms as is consistent with Section 409A
of the Code. For purposes of the preceding sentence, each vested Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award for which settlement was delayed for the purpose
of avoiding a loss of deduction pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code shall
be treated as providing for settlement upon a change in control.

(d) At the Effective Time, each performance share unit award in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Performance
Share Unit Award") shall (i) if unvested, be converted automatically into a
cash-settled restricted stock unit award (an "Adjusted Performance Share Unit
Award") with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Performance Share Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that such Adjusted Performance Share Unit Award shall be subject
solely to time based vesting and settlement shall be in the form of a cash
payment equal to the fair market value (determined under the methodology used
by Parent for determining fair market value for employee equity awards
generally) of the Parent Common Shares to which the award relates), and
relating to the number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product (taken to
the fourth decimal place) of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such 

Company Performance Share Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, or (ii) if vested, be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but not later than ten (10) days) after the Effective
Time, (A) a cash payment equal to the Per Unit Total Consideration (without
interest and less applicable Tax withholding) in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Performance Share Unit Award and
(B) a cash payment equal to all dividend equivalents accumulated with respect
to such Company Performance Share Unit Award that have not been paid prior to
the Effective Time; provided, that if the terms of any such vested Company
Performance Share Unit Award do not provide for settlement upon a change in
control, such vested Company Performance Share Unit Award shall instead be
converted into an Adjusted Performance Share Unit Award pursuant to clause (i)
above and shall be settled at the earliest time provided by its terms as is
consistent with Section 409A of the Code. For all purposes of this Section
1.8(d), the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each
Performance Share Unit Award that was granted in 2014, 2015 or 2016 that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be determined by
assuming that the applicable performance goals have been achieved at the
maximum level.

(e) At the Effective Time, each stock unit (each, a "Deferred Unit") credited
to an account that is deemed invested in Company Common Stock as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time under Company's Deferred Compensation
Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") shall be converted automatically into
a deemed investment relating to Parent Common Shares that will be cash-settled
(with the cash payment due on settlement equal to the fair market value
(determined under the methodology used by Parent for determining fair market
value for employee equity awards generally) of the Parent Common Shares to
which the Deferred Units relate), with the number of Parent Common Shares
subject to the Deferred Units in a participant's account under the Deferred
Compensation Plan as of the Effective Time to be equal to the product (taken
to the fourth decimal place) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Deferred Units as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Following the Effective Time,
the Deferred Compensation Plan will otherwise continue to be maintained by the
Surviving Corporation with the same terms, including payment terms and
investment alternatives that were applicable immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with the Company Common Stock fund to be replaced with a
Parent Common Shares fund, subject to all rights of the Company (and the
Surviving Corporation as its successor) to amend or terminate the Deferred
Compensation Plan.

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, Company, the Board of Directors of the
Company and its Compensation Committee, and Parent, the Board of Directors of
Parent and its Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
1.8, including, in the case of the Board of Directors of Company and its
Compensation Committee, a resolution providing that the Adjusted Stock
Options, Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards, Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit
Awards and Adjusted Performance Share Unit Awards constitute a "Replacement
Award" as defined in the Company Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive
Compensation Plan and the award agreements issued thereunder, and, in the case
of the Board of Directors of Parent and its Compensation Committee, the
reservation, issuance and listing of the shares of Parent Common Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Equity Awards (as defined
below) contemplated herein and the assumption by Parent of the Company Stock
Plans and the award 

agreement thereunder. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a post-
effective amendment to the Form F-4 or an effective registration statement on
Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the Parent Common Shares
subject to Adjusted Stock Options and Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards and
shall distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8, if applicable, and
Parent shall use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement for so long as such Adjusted Stock Options and
Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards remain outstanding.

(g) As used herein, the phrase the "Company Equity Awards" means the Company
Performance Share Unit Awards, the Company Stock Options, the Company
Restricted Stock Awards, and the Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards.

1.9 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Holdco as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until duly amended in accordance with the
respective terms thereof and applicable law.

1.10 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

ARTICLE II 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited by Holdco, with a bank or trust company designated
by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance with
this Article II, (a) certificates, or at Parent's option, evidence of shares
in book entry form, representing the Parent Common Shares ("New
Certificates"), to be delivered to the holders of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.5 and this Article II in exchange for outstanding shares
of such Company Common Stock, and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to allow
the Exchange Agent to make all payments required pursuant to this Article II
(such New Certificates and cash, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old
Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent or Holdco, or as otherwise directed by Parent.

2.2 Appraisal Rights. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under the DGCL
and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. Company shall give
Parent prompt notice upon receipt by Company of any such demands for payment
of the fair 

value of such shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of such notice
and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any stockholder
duly making such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Stockholder").
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting
Stockholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL.
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Any payments
made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its right to such
payment at or prior to the Effective Time, such holder's shares of Company
Common Stock shall be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5(a).

2.3 Exchange Procedures.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of
record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing the number of whole Parent Common
Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(b). From
and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or
Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, subject to Section 2.2, (i) a New Certificate representing
that number of whole Parent Common Shares to which such holder of Company
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article
I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions
of this Article II, (B) any cash in lieu of a fractional share which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and
(C) and dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old
Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this Article II, and the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued with respect to any property to be
delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section
2.3. 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole Parent Common Shares
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any New Certificate representing Parent Common Shares is to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
New Certificate representing Parent Common Shares in any name other than that
of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Shares shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay
to each former stockholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to
receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the volume-weighted average trading price of one
Parent Common Share for the ten (10) day period in which both the Canadian and
U.S. Markets are open for trading ending on the last such day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, calculated using both Canadian and U.S. trading
prices and volumes during normal market hours and assuming in respect of such
trading prices on the TSX, for each trading day, the Bank of Canada daily noon
Canada/U.S. exchange rate for the Canadian calculations (the "Parent Share
Closing Price") by (ii) the fraction of a Parent Common Share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock owned by such holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time).

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of Company who have
not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid 

dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Shares deliverable in respect
of each former share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause Holdco, Company
or the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common
Shares, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.3
or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent, Holdco, Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which the deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, Holdco, Company or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be.

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends
or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Company to
Parent prior to the execution hereof (the "Company Disclosure Schedule")
(provided, that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Company that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III shall
be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III specifically
referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this Article III to
the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence
of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections) or (ii) as disclosed in any Company
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor
disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of
risks set forth in any "forward-looking 

statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Holdco as follows:

3.1 Corporate Organization.

(a) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the
"BHC Act"). Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. As used in
this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to
Parent, Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results
of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after
the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
(or, with respect to Parent, International Financial Reporting Standards
("IFRS")) or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after
the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to
companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate,
or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes,
after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market
conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not
specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, including changes in
prevailing interest rates, credit availability and liquidity, currency
exchange rates and price levels or trading volumes in U.S. or foreign
securities markets or any change in the credit markets, (D) failure, in and of
itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts, but not
including the underlying causes thereof (unless otherwise excluded hereunder),
(E) changes attributable to disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby
or to actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) actions or omissions taken pursuant
to the written consent of Parent, in the case of Company, or Company, in the
case of Parent; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the
extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately
adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party
and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement,
the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party, means any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated
with such party for financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Company, as amended (the "Company
Certificate"), and the bylaws of Company, as amended (the "Company Bylaws"),
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by Company to Parent. 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Company (a "Company Subsidiary") (i) is duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii)
is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so
qualified would reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company and (iii) has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the
ability of any Company Subsidiary to pay dividends or distributions except, in
the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on
dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated
entities. The deposit accounts of each Company Subsidiary that is an insured
depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in
Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or, to Company's knowledge,
threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of (x) all Company Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof and their jurisdiction of formation and, for any Company Subsidiaries
that are not directly or indirectly wholly owned by Company, their capital
structure (including the identity of any other equity holders), (y) all
persons (not including Company Subsidiaries) in which Company, together with
any Company Subsidiaries, owns (directly or indirectly) more than 4.9% of a
class of voting securities and (z) all outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements obligating Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities of
any other person for its or their own account. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries is required to register with the SEC as an investment
advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a broker-dealer under Section
15(b) of the Exchange Act.

3.2 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 174,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock, without par value, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
without par value, and 5,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock, without
par value. As of June 24, 2016, no shares of capital stock or other voting

Awards (assuming, with respect to any such unvested Company Performance Share
Award, that all applicable performance goals are achieved at the maximum
level); and (vi) 138,956 shares of Company Common Stock underlying the
Deferred Units under the Deferred 

Compensation Plans. All the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, non-
assessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching
to the ownership thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any
matters on which stockholders of Company may vote are issued or outstanding.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as
of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated debt
securities of Company or any Company Subsidiary are issued or outstanding.
Other than the Company Equity Awards, in each case, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such securities or any dividend reinvestment plans
relating to Company Securities.

(b) There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries has a contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting
or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of Company.
Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of all Company Equity Awards outstanding as of the date
hereof specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder,
(ii) the number of shares subject to each such Company Equity Award, (iii) the
grant date of each such Company Equity Award, (iv) the Company Stock Plan
under which each such Company Equity Award was granted, (v) the exercise price
for each such Company Equity Award that is a Company Stock Option, (vi) the
vesting schedule applicable to each such Company Equity Award, and (vii) the
expiration date of each such Company Equity Award that is a Company Stock
Option. As of the date hereof, other than the Company Equity Awards and
Deferred Units, no equity-based awards (including any cash awards where the
amount of payment is determined in whole or in part based on the price of any
capital stock of Company or any Company Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

(c) Company owns, directly or indirectly, all the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all such shares
or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, non-assessable (except, with respect to Company Subsidiaries that
are insured depository institutions, as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any
comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights,
with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Company
Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

3.3 Authority; No Violation.

(a) Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Company. The
Board of Directors of Company has 

determined that the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is in the best interests of Company and its stockholders and has
directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be
submitted to Company's stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such
stockholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of
outstanding Company Common Stock (the "Requisite Company Vote"), no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Company are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Company and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of Company, enforceable against Company in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting insured depository institutions or the rights of creditors generally
and subject to general principles of equity (the "Enforceability
Exceptions")).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Company nor the
consummation by Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws or (ii)
assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 3.4
are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code, ordinance,
rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of
or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under,
result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under,
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the respective properties or assets of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or

Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of

Effect, there is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There have

meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or 

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their
respective dates, all Company SEC Reports filed or furnished under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Company has
failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under

issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Reports.

present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash

respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules

The books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries have been, since January
1, 2013, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements. Ernst and Young
LLP has not resigned (or informed Company that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of Company as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Company on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company, neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Company included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 (including any notes
thereto), (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non- 

direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company.
Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Company by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Company's outside auditors and the
audit committee of Company's Board of Directors (x) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the
knowledge of Company, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Company's
internal controls over financial reporting. Copies of any such disclosures
were made in writing by management to Company's auditors and audit committee
and a copy has been previously made available to Parent. To the knowledge of
Company, there is no reason to believe that Company's outside auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, prior to the Closing Date.

assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Company, oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or written claim that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Company or any of its officers, directors or employees to the Board of
Directors of Company or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Company,
to any director or officer of Company.

Affiliate"), is a party or has any obligation or (ii) that are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Company ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer, director or independent contractor (who is a natural person) of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA Affiliate.

(b) Company has heretofore provided to Parent a true and complete copy of each
Company Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Company or any Company

in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code, and, to Company's
knowledge, no event has 

occurred which would reasonably be expected to result in any such Company
Benefit Plan to fail to comply in any material respect with such requirements

result in, a material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award thereunder,
in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since
January 1, 2006, been maintained and operated in good faith compliance with

the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or (C) has
two (2) or more contributing sponsors at least two (2) of whom are not under

post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired or former employees or beneficiaries or dependents
thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

(h) All material contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan
by applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking,
and all material premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies

Benefit Plan, for any period in the prior three (3) years through the date
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the books and records of Company.

(i) There are no pending or, to Company's knowledge, material threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to Company's
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be likely to
give rise to a material claim or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans,
any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit
Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit
Plans.

(j) None of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA Affiliate, nor,
to Company's knowledge, any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the Company Benefit Plans or their related trusts,
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Company ERISA Affiliate or any person
that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any
material tax or material penalty imposed under Section 4975 or 4976 of the
Code or Section 409 or 502 of ERISA.

(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result in or cause an acceleration of the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or
independent contractor (who is a natural person) of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) entitle any employee,
officer, director or independent contractor (who is a natural person) of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or (iii) result in any
limitation on the right of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or
related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar
funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
cause or require Company or any of its affiliates to establish or make any
contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle.

(l) No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A of the Code.

(m) No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code.

applicable Laws regarding employment, equal employment opportunity and pay,
worker classification, labor, leaves, workers' compensation, disability,
occupational health and safety, immigration, collective bargaining,
secondment, contractors and temporary employees, other employment 

terms and conditions, plant closings and layoffs (including the WARN Act),
withholding and payment of social security and other taxes, and wage and hour
matters. There are no pending or, to Company's knowledge, threatened material
employment claims or charges, labor grievances or material unfair labor
practice claims or charges against Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
strikes or other material labor disputes against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are party to or
bound by any collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor
organization, or work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization
applicable to employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to
Company's knowledge, there are no organizing efforts by any union seeking to
represent any employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and

execution and delivery by Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and Holdco, enforceable against Parent in accordance with
its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions). The Parent Common Shares to be issued in the
Merger have been validly authorized and, when issued, will 

be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and no current or past
shareholder of Parent will have any preemptive right or similar rights in
respect thereof.

Holdco, nor the consummation by each of Parent and Holdco of the transactions

organizational documents of Parent or Holdco, as applicable, or (ii) assuming
that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 4.4 are duly
obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to Parent,
Holdco or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of
or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under,
result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under,
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the respective properties or assets of Parent, Holdco or any of
their Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or
other instrument or obligation to which Parent, Holdco or any of their
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above)
for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or creations which either individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

4.4 Consents and Approvals. Except for (i) the filing of applications, filings
and notices, as applicable, with the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act,
OSFI under the Bank Act (Canada) and the Illinois Department of Financial and
Professional Regulation, Division of Banking under Illinois law, and approval

no consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any Governmental
Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and delivery by each
of Parent and Holdco of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by each of
Parent and Holdco of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents will not be
received in order to permit consummation of the Merger on a timely basis. No
vote or other approval of the shareholders or any other securityholders of
Parent is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance
of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereof
(including the issuance of stock consideration) in accordance with the terms
hereof, whether by reason of applicable law, the organizational documents of
Parent, the rules or requirements of any exchange, or otherwise. 

4.5 Reports.

(a) Each of Parent, Holdco and their respective Subsidiaries has timely filed
or furnished, as applicable, all material reports, registrations and
statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that they were required to file (or furnish, as applicable) since
January 1, 2013 with any Regulatory Agencies, including any material report,
registration or statement required to be filed (or furnished, as applicable)
pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any state,
any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith. Except for examinations
of Parent, Holdco and their respective Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory
Agency in the ordinary course of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated
or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent or Holdco,
investigation into the business or operations of Parent, Holdco or any of
their respective Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013. Except as would not
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, there is no unresolved violation, criticism or
exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement
relating to any examinations or inspections of Parent, Holdco or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2013
(the "Parent SEC Reports") is publicly available. No such Parent SEC Report,
at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their
respective dates, all Parent SEC Reports filed or furnished under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Parent has
failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from, or material unresolved
issues raised by, the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

4.6 Financial Statements.

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and 

regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with IFRS or Canadian generally accepted accounting principles
("Canadian GAAP"), as applicable, consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been,
since January 1, 2013, and are being maintained in all material respects in
accordance with IFRS, Canadian GAAP or GAAP, as applicable, and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements. Ernst and Young LLP has not
resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, none of Parent, Holdco
or any of their respective Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its
Quarterly Report to Shareholders filed with the SEC on Form 6-K for the fiscal
quarter ended April 30, 2016 (including any notes thereto), (ii) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since April 30, 2016 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or (iii) liabilities that are not material to Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (i) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Parent,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parent's outside auditors and the
audit committee of Parent's Board of Directors (x) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the
knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal
controls over financial reporting. Copies of any such disclosures were made in
writing by management to Parent's auditors and audit committee and a copy has
previously been made available to Company. To the knowledge of Parent, there
is no reason to believe that Parent's outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, prior to the Closing Date. 

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) none of Parent, Holdco or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent, Holdco or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Parent, Holdco or any of their respective Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or written claim that Parent, Holdco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing Parent, Holdco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent, Holdco or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent,
Holdco or any of their respective officers, directors or employees to the
Board of Directors of either Parent or Holdco or any committee thereof or to
the knowledge of Parent, to any director or officer of Parent or Holdco.

4.7 Broker's Fees. None of Parent, Holdco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers or directors, has employed

related transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than CIBC World
Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.

events have occurred that have had or would reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

to Parent's knowledge, threatened against or involving Parent or Holdco or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or, in their capacities as such, any of the
current or former directors or executive officers of Parent, Holdco or any of
their Subsidiaries (and Parent is not aware of any basis for any such suit,
action or proceeding) (i) that would reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or (ii)
of a material nature challenging the validity or propriety of this Agreement.

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction

in Article VII not being satisfied; or

(d) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of
its Board of Directors in support of, any of the actions prohibited by this
Section 5.3. 

ARTICLE VI 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 Regulatory Matters.

(a) Parent and Company shall prepare the F-4 and the Proxy Statement promptly
and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement.
Parent shall thereupon file the F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus, with the SEC. Each of Parent and Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the F-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Company shall
thereafter file the Proxy Statement with the SEC and mail or deliver the Proxy
Statement to its stockholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Company shall furnish all information concerning Company and
the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

(b) Subject to other provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall
cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications,
notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to
comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental Entities.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and
in no event later than forty (40) days after the date of this Agreement,
Parent and Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
each prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required in order
to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Parent and Company shall each
use, and shall each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use, reasonable
best efforts to obtain each such Requisite Regulatory Approval as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The parties shall cooperate with each other in
connection therewith (including the furnishing of any information and any
reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be required to obtain the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals). Parent and Company shall have the right to
review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other
on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to Company or Parent, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party will provide the
other with copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto
prior to filing, other than any portions of material filed in connection
therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary
information filed under a claim of confidentiality and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information. The parties hereto agree that
they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated 

by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.
Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; provided that each
party shall be permitted to respond to inbound telephone calls or other
inquiries from any Governmental Entity, and to provide informal status updates
to a Governmental Entity, in each case without consulting in advance with the
other party; provided, further, that Parent shall be permitted to redact from
copies provided to Company of written materials submitted or intended for
submission by Parent to OSFI, information relating to the business or
operations of Parent to the extent that access to such information is not
required for Company to reasonably assess the status of matters relating to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent
need not include Company in meetings or conferences, or portions of meetings
or conferences, between Parent (or any of its affiliates) and OSFI in which
the business or operations of Parent will be discussed with OSFI, provided
that if such a discussion is germane to the status of matters relating to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent will
promptly inform Company of the occurrence of such a meeting and the general
subject discussed and provide Company with summary information conveying the
import of the matters discussed.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require
Parent or Company to take, or commit to take, any action or agree to any
condition or restriction that would reasonably be likely to have a material
and adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, giving
effect to the Merger (with such materiality measured on a scale relative to
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a "Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition").

(d) Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information to which they have access concerning themselves, their
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement, the F-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and Company
agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, (i) that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the F-4 will, at the time the F-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto,
if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and
(ii) that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders
and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the 

circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each of
Parent and Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that any
information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the F-4 or
the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof
and to take appropriate steps to correct the F-4 or the Proxy Statement.

(e) Parent and Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

(f) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, comply with the
"reporting requirements" of Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

6.2 Access to Information.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of Parent reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, personnel, information
technology systems and records, and each shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by
entering into customary confidentiality, nondisclosure and similar agreements
with service providers), and, during such period, Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent such information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
interference with Company's regular business operations during any such
access. Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, Parent shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish or otherwise make
available to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other
representatives of Company such information concerning its businesses as is
reasonably relevant to Company and its stockholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(b) Each party shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of it or
any of its Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the confidentiality agreement, dated April 25, 2016, by and between Parent
and Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"); provided that, 

as of the date of this Agreement, Sections 13 and 15 of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate and no longer be in effect.

(c) No investigation by Parent, Company or their respective representatives
pursuant to this Section 6.2 or prior to the date of this Agreement shall
affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of
the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
either Parent or Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

6.3 Company Stockholder Approval.

(a) Company shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company
Certificate and Company Bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
its stockholders (the "Company Meeting") to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the F-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type
customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders to
adopt a merger agreement. The Board of Directors of Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of Company the
Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its stockholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that
they adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Company shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent
to assist in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to the
Requisite Company Vote. However, subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Board
of Directors of Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in
good faith that, because of the receipt by Company of an Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith constitutes a
Superior Proposal, it would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law
to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to
its stockholders, the Board of Directors of Company may submit this Agreement
to its stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving
this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Board of Directors of Company may communicate the basis for
its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;
provided that the Board of Directors of Company may not take any actions under
this sentence unless (i) it gives Parent at least four (4) business days'
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable
description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of
Directors of Company in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest
material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in
reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the Board of Directors of Company takes into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to 

recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section
6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3.

(b) Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting (i) if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or (ii)
if, on the date of such meeting, Company has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be
convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Company
at the Company Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this
Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve Company of such obligation. Company shall
only be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting twice pursuant to
this Section 6.3(b).

6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII
hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b)
to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall cause the Parent Common Shares to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE and the TSX, in
each case subject to official notices of issuance, prior to the Effective
Time.

6.6 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on October
31, 2018 (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide each employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Time who remains employed by Parent or any of its affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) following the
Effective Time (a "Continuing Employee") with (i) an annual base salary or
base wage rate that is no less than that provided to such employee by Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) a total
incentive compensation opportunity that is no less than the aggregate total
incentive compensation opportunity (whether relating to annual or any other
type of incentive compensation) provided to such employee by Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to such employees by Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In addition, Parent agrees that, for each Continuing Employee,
the terms and conditions of (A) the annual long-term 

incentive awards granted in respect of calendar year 2016 to be granted in the
first quarter of 2017, (B) the 2017 annual short-term incentive award and (C)
to the extent applicable, mandatory 2016 annual bonus deferrals, shall, in
each case, be consistent with the terms described on Section 6.6(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. During the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the second anniversary of the Effective Time (the
"Severance Continuation Period"), Parent shall continue to maintain or cause
to be maintained, without amendment, the Company's severance plan applicable
to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time which shall
include the terms set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the "Company Severance Plan"), and shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to each Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated during
the Severance Continuation Period without "cause", as such term is defined or
concept is used for purposes of the Company Severance Plan, or who otherwise
experiences a severance-qualifying termination under the Company Severance
Plan, with the severance benefits specified in the Company Severance Plan.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any employees of Company or its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to:

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each such employee and his or her eligible
dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan, and (B) provide each such employee and his or her
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans; and

(ii) recognize all service of each such employee with Company and its
Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors, if applicable) for all
purposes in any New Plan; provided that the foregoing service recognition
shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits
for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit
pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to
any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any
right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Company, Parent
or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services
of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or 

terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit
or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person, other than the parties hereto, including any current or
former employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director,
officer or employee of Company and its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under Company Benefit Plans (in each case, when
acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising
before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of (i) the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Company or
any Company Subsidiary or is or was a fiduciary of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under Company Benefit Plans or (ii) matters, acts or omissions
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated hereby to the same extent as such persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Company pursuant to the
Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the governing or organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary and any indemnification agreements in
existence as of the date hereof; and Parent shall also cause the Surviving
Corporation to advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party
to the same extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as
of the date of this Agreement by Company pursuant to the Company Certificate,
the Company Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date
hereof; provided that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Company
(provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and
directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events
which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
Company for such insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the
Surviving Corporation's good faith determination, provide the maximum 

coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, Company, in consultation with Parent may (and at the request of
Parent, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior
to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under Company's existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap
(it being understood that any failure by Company to obtain such a "tail"
policy shall not modify or alter in any manner any of the obligations of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7).

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation, or any of its successors or assigns, consolidates with
or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity
of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its
assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction,
then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.8 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as
may be reasonably requested by any other party, at the expense of the party
who makes any such request.

6.9 Advice of Changes. Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise the
other of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that has had
or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which
it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9,
provide a basis for terminating this Agreement or constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying fact, change, event or circumstance
would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Article
VII to be satisfied or provide a basis for terminating this Agreement or
constitute a breach of this Agreement.

6.10 Acquisition Proposals.

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning or (iii) provide
any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate
in any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that, prior to receipt of the Requisite Company 

Vote, in the event Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is more likely than not
result in a Superior Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions
would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
provided, further, that, prior to or substantially concurrently with providing
any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, Company shall have provided notice to Parent of its intention to
provide such information, and shall have provided such information to Parent
if not previously provided to Parent, and shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to
it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall
not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Company.
Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Company will promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to
result in an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the
terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) advise Parent of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of
the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to (x) enforce any
existing confidentiality, standstill or similar agreements to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal, and (y)
within ten (10) business days after the date hereof, request and confirm the
return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any person
(other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement. Unless this Agreement is contemporaneously
terminated in accordance with its terms, Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and
representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.10(a)) relating
to any Acquisition Proposal).

(b) As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal, inquiry
or indication of interest, made by a person (or a group of persons acting in
concert within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) relating to (i)
any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the consolidated assets of Company and its Subsidiaries or twenty
percent (20%) or more of any class of voting securities of Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated assets of Company, (ii) any
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than twenty percent (20%) of
the consolidated assets of Company, or 

(iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute more than twenty percent (20%) of the
consolidated assets of Company, except, in each case, any sale of whole loans
and securitizations in the ordinary course of business and any bona fide
internal reorganization.

(c) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders
than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a nationally
recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account the
likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein
and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside
counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal),
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any other relevant
factors permitted under applicable law; provided, that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such Rules will in no
way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.11 Public Announcements. Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable
best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by
(i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity,
(iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange or (iv) disclosures by Parent in connection with the
offering of securities or capital raising, each of Company and Parent agrees
to consult with the other and to obtain the advance approval of the other
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making
any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that Company shall not be required to comply
with such joint communications plan pursuant to this Section 6.11 with respect
to communications made relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

6.12 Change of Method. Parent may at any time change the method of effecting
the transactions contemplated hereby if and to the extent requested by Parent,
and Company hereby agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as
Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring,
including effecting the acquisition of Company by Parent through other
affiliates of Parent; provided, however, that no such change or amendment
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration
provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the
Merger with respect to Company's stockholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to
cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed. 

6.13 Restructuring Efforts. If Company shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction
provided for herein (provided, however, that no party shall have any
obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of this
Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, in a
manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or (ii) adversely affect the
Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to Company's stockholders) and/or (in
the case of Company) resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.13) to its stockholders
for approval or adoption.

6.14 Takeover Statutes. No party shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each party shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from
any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover
Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each party and its respective board of directors will
grant such approvals and take such actions within its control as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.15 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and Company shall each take such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or
conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

6.16 Litigation and Claims. Each of Parent and Company shall promptly notify
each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or
Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be expected to
question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated
hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent, Company or
their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to
enjoin, materially delay or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at
its own expense in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against Company and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

6.17 Company Debt. Parent will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, by or on behalf of Holdco, at or prior to the Effective Time,
any supplements, amendments or other instruments required for the due
assumption of Company's outstanding fixed and floating rate Junior
Subordinated Debentures due 2034, 2035 and 2068 and 7.125% Subordinated
Debentures due 2042 (collectively, the "Company Debentures") and (to the
extent informed of such requirement by the Company) other agreements to the
extent required by the terms of the Company Debentures.

6.18 Financial Statements and Other Current Information. As soon as reasonably
practicable after they become available, but in no event more than thirty (30)
days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date hereof,
Company will furnish to Parent (a) consolidated financial statements
(including balance sheets, statements of operations and shareholders' equity)
of Company and any of its Subsidiaries (to the extent available) as of and for
such month then ended, (b) internal management reports showing actual
financial performance against plan and previous period, and (c) to the extent
permitted by applicable law, any reports provided to Company's Board of
Directors or any committee thereof relating to the financial performance and
risk management of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.19 Company Dividends. After the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
Closing or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Company
shall coordinate with Parent regarding the record dates and payment dates for
dividends in respect of Company Common Stock, it being the intention of the
parties that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect
to their shares of Company Common Stock and any Parent Common Shares any such
holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. Parent agrees that, in the
event that a dividend record date with respect to Parent Common Shares is
anticipated to occur contemporaneously with the anticipated Closing, the
parties shall cooperate to implement the intentions of the parties set forth
in this Section 6.19 and to the extent practicable have the Effective Time
occur prior to such record date.

6.20 Corporate Governance.

(a) Parent shall take all appropriate action so that, as of the Effective
Time, subject to Parent's organizational documents, policies and applicable
law and regulation, one (1) individual designated by Company and reasonably
acceptable to Parent (the "Company Director") shall be appointed as an
independent director of Parent. The Company Director shall thereafter be
nominated for election as a director of Parent, subject to the approval of the
Board of Directors, at Parent's first annual meeting of shareholders after the
Closing Date. Subject to the foregoing, the Company Director, once duly
confirmed as a director, shall be given the opportunity to serve on at least

committee determination to be as recommended by Parent's Corporate Governance
Committee from time to time, for so long as the Company Director is a member
of the Board of Directors of Parent.

(b) Parent will take all appropriate action so that, as of the Effective Time,
subject to Parent's organizational documents, policies and applicable law and
regulation, the board of directors of Holdco (and any successor thereto) will
be comprised of nine (9) directors, 

of whom three (3) independent directors and one (1) non-independent director
will be individuals designated by Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent,
subject to Holdco's organizational documents, policies and applicable law and
regulation.

subject to Parent's organizational documents, policies and applicable law and
regulation, the board of directors of Company Bank (and any successor thereto)

directors and one (1) non-independent director will be individuals designated
by Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent, subject to Company Bank's
organizational documents, policies and applicable law and regulation.

(d) At the Effective Time, Company Bank will be headquartered in Chicago,
Illinois and that Holdco and Company Bank will constitute the primary banking,
lending and wealth management platform of Parent in the United States.

date of this Agreement, Company shall provide Parent with a complete and
accurate list of all Registered Owned Intellectual Property, in each case

owner, (ii) the jurisdiction where the application/registration is located
(or, for internet domain names, the applicable registrar), (iii) the

by Parent, at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following conditions:

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Company set forth in Section 3.2(a) and Section 3.8(a) (in each case after
giving effect to the lead-in to Article III) shall be true and correct (other
than, in the case of Section 3.2(a), such failures to be true and correct as
are de minimis) in each case as of the date of this Agreement and (except to
the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date) as
of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date, and the
representations and warranties of Company set forth in Section 3.1, Section

Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties but, in each
case, after giving effect to the lead-in to Article III) shall be true and
correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to the
extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of

warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or
failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,

"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii)
that the Merger will not result in gain recognition to the holders of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code (assuming that in the case
of any such holder who would be treated as a "five-percent transferee
shareholder" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), such holder enters into a five-year gain recognition
agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8, as
provided for in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B), and
complies with the requirements of that agreement and Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-8 for avoiding the recognition of gain). In rendering such
opinion, Mayer Brown LLP will be entitled to receive and rely upon customary
certificates and representations of officers of Parent, Holdco and Company.

Parent and Holdco set forth in Section 4.2(a) and Section 4.8 (in each case,
after giving effect to the lead-in to Article IV) shall be true and correct

correct as are de minimis) in each case as of the date of this Agreement and
(except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date, and the representations and warranties of Parent set forth in Sections
4.1, 4.2(b) and 4.3(a) (in each case, after giving effect to the lead-in to
Article IV) shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date
of this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and
warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of the Closing Date. All other representations and warranties of
Parent set forth in this Agreement (read without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such
representations or warranties but, in each case, after giving effect to the
lead-in to Article IV) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the
date of this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and
warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of the Closing Date, provided, however, that for purposes of this
sentence, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and
correct unless the failure or failures of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and
without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties, has had or
would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the

Financial Officer of Holdco.

(c) Federal Tax Opinion. Company shall have received an opinion of Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Company, dated as of the Closing Date and based on facts, representations and
assumptions described in such opinion, to the effect that (i) the Merger will
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and (ii) that the Merger will not result in gain recognition to the holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code (assuming that, in
the case of any such holder who would be treated as a "five-percent transferee
shareholder" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), such holder enters into a five-year gain recognition
agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8, as
provided for in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B), and
complies with the requirements of that agreement and Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-8 for avoiding the recognition of gain). In rendering such
opinion, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz will be entitled to receive and rely
upon customary certificates and representations of officers of Parent, Holdco

ARTICLE VIII 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Company:

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and Company in a written instrument;

(b) by either Parent or Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and such denial has become final and non-
appealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final non-appealable order, injunction or decree permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, unless the failure to
obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Parent or Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the
"Termination Date"), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein;

(d) by either Parent or Company (provided, that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set 

forth in this Agreement on the part of Company, in the case of a termination
by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as the
case may be, and which is not cured before the earlier of the Termination Date
and 60 days following written notice to Company, in the case of a termination
by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by Company, or by its
nature or timing cannot be cured during such period; or

(e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, Company or the Board of Directors of Company (A) submits this
Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation for approval, or
otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or publicly
discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its
recommendation as contemplated by Section 6.3(a), or recommends to its
stockholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially
breaches its obligations under Section 6.3 or its obligations under Section
6.10; or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent
or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors of Company recommends
that the stockholders of Company tender their shares in such tender or
exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such stockholders reject
such tender offer or exchange offer within the 10 business day period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

8.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or Company
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, and none of Parent, Company, Holdco, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 3.3(a), 3.7,
4.3(a), 4.7, 6.2(b), this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Company shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, in the
case of Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Common Stock
of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of premium offered
to such holders).

(b) (i) In the event that (A) after the date of this Agreement a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of
Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Company and thereafter (x) this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without 

the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained, or (y) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (B) prior to the date
that is fifteen (15) months after the date of any applicable termination
described in clauses (x) through (y) hereof, Company enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then
Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by
wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $150,000,000 (the "Termination
Fee"); provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) (or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c) but
at the time of such termination Parent could have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e)), then Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer
of same day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical
after the date of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business
days thereafter).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by Company under this Section 8.2 shall be equal to the
Termination Fee, and in no event shall Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of Parent and Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Company for the
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Company shall pay the costs and
expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. In addition, if Company fails to pay the amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then Company shall pay interest on such
overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such
overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the
"prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto)
in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid. The amount payable by Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b)
shall, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, be the sole monetary
remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in
such section.

ARTICLE IX 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

stockholders of Company, there may not be, without further approval of such
stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval
under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or

9.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

9.11 Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by

operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section
6.7, which is intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and representatives, this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) is not intended to and does not confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Except as provided in Section 6.7,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, no consent,
approval or agreement of any third party beneficiary will be required to
amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement.

9.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
subject to Section 8.2(a) and the last sentence of Section 8.2(d), the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the
parties' obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post
security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

9.13 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

9.14 Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement,
and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver
a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file
as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever
waives any such defense.
