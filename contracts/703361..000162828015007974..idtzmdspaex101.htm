| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

In the event that the Closing Actions are not all satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement latest on the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the Targeted Closing Date,

---|--- 

(i)

|

the Sellers jointly may terminate this Agreement (zurucktreten) with immediate

perform its obligations concerning the Closing Actions under Clauses 6.2(a)(i)

provided that any right of a Party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Clause 6.3(a) shall cease (verfallen) upon the earlier of (i) the

to such termination, being satisfied or duly waived, and (ii) the occurrence

the Company and its Subsidiaries of Company IP Rights (except for off-the-
shelf software) owned by a third party, which Company IP Rights are
incorporated into or used for the Company's or its Subsidiaries' products or
services. There is no material breach of any such Contract by the Company or
any Subsidiary and none of these Contracts has been terminated nor are there,
to the Sellers\' Knowledge, any circumstances which would make any such breach
or termination reasonably likely in the future, in particular, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement will not
constitute a breach, give either party a right of termination, modify the
scope of license, result in additional payments or consideration, or otherwise
materially alter the terms of such Contract.

Neither the Company nor or a Subsidiary have received any written notice of
any infringement by the Company or a Subsidiary of any third party IP Rights,
and neither the Company nor a Subsidiary are involved in any ongoing

Knowledge, there are no circumstances which would constitute an infringement
by the Company or a Subsidiary of any third party IP Rights, be it by the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' products or services or by the Company's or a
Subsidiary's acts or behaviour. 

| 
---|---

License (SCSL) the Sun Industry Standards License (SISL) and the Apache
License) (the Open Source Materials) necessary to continue the business of the
Company or any Subsidiary as currently conducted. Neither the Company nor any

material parts of Company software in source code form or make material parts
of Company software available at no charge.

have no obligations to do so (except for obligations under customary source
code escrow agreements). 

| 
---|--- 

(k)

|

Each Group Company has taken appropriate measures to protect its know-how
(including through confidentiality obligations in the employment agreements).
To the Sellers¬¥ Knowledge no know-how and Company IP Rights (where the value

policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the
underwriters of such policies. No Group Company has received any written
notice from any insurer that the insurance premiums under any policy will be

Agreement shall imply a duty of Seller 2 and Seller 3 to make specific or
other inquiries or searches of whatever nature, and that the lack of such

REMEDIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY 

| 
---|--- 

8.1

|

Exhaustive Provisions 

Except for mandatory law requiring otherwise, in particular Sections 123 and
276 para. 3 BGB, and except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement:
(a) the provisions set forth in this Clause 8 shall apply instead and to the
exclusion of any and all remedies that would otherwise be available to the
Purchaser under statutory law in the event of any breach of the Sellers'
Guarantees or, if explicitly referred thereto, any breach or non-fulfilment of
any other obligation, covenant or undertaking of the Sellers arising from or
relating to this Agreement; and (b) any further liability of the Sellers,
their Affiliates and their representatives, employees, directors, agents,
officers or advisers and any differing or further rights or claims of the
Purchaser other than explicitly provided for in this Agreement, irrespective
of their nature or legal basis, are hereby expressly excluded and waived,
including any right to rescind (anfechten) or to withdraw (zurucktreten) from
this Agreement or to require on whatever legal basis the winding up of the
Transactions (Ruckabwicklung des Vertrages gleich auf welcher Rechtsgrundlage,
z.B. aufgrund gro√üen Schadensersatzes/Schadensersatzes statt der Leistung), to
claim remediation (Nacherfullung), to reduce (mindern) the Purchase Price
payable under this Agreement and/or to claim damages (Schadensersatz) or
reimbursement of frustrated expenditure (Ersatz vergeblicher Aufwendungen).
The foregoing shall apply in particular, without limitation, to any rights and
claims arising from or in connection with (i) defects in quality or title
(Sach- oder Rechtsmangel) pursuant to Sections 437 to 441 BGB, (ii)
incorrectness of any of the Sellers' Guarantees or other guarantees,
warranties, indemnities or similar undertakings, (iii) breach of any
contractual or pre-contractual obligation (culpa in contrahendo), including

ancillary obligations (Nebenpflichten) including claims pursuant to Section
280 BGB, (iv) tort, (v) interference with the contractual basis pursuant to
Section 313 BGB (Storung der Geschaftsgrundlage). Reference is made to Clause
8.8(b).

Scope of Remedies 

In the event of any breach or non-fulfilment by any Seller of a Sellers'
Guarantee pursuant to Clause 7 or a breach or non-fulfilment of any other
obligation, covenant



Page 40 of 64

2813477

* * *



or undertaking of the Sellers arising from or in connection with this
Agreement other than those set forth in Clause 9 (Tax) for which the
provisions contained in Clause 9 (Tax) shall apply (each a Sellers' Breach),
the Sellers shall put the Purchaser or, at the Purchaser's election, the
relevant Group Company, into the position it would have been in had the
Sellers\' Breach not occurred (Naturalrestitution). If and to the extent such
remediation in kind (Naturalrestitution) (a) has not been effected by the
Sellers within a period of thirty (30) Business Days after the receipt of a
Breach Notice, (b) is impossible, or (c) is refused in writing by the Sellers,
then the Purchaser shall be entitled to request from the Sellers compensation
in cash (Schadenersatz in Geld) for any losses incurred by the Purchaser or
any Group Company, provided, however, that such losses shall be determined by
using the legal principles of calculation of damages, mitigation of damages
and off-setting of losses by advantages (Schadensberechnung,
Schadensminderung, Vorteilsausgleich) pursuant to Sections 249 et seq. BGB.
Losses shall, however, not include any internal administration and overhead
costs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers
shall not be liable for a failure of the Company to achieve future profits or
other financial figures anticipated by Purchaser when entering into this
Transaction, and any arguments that the Total Purchase Price was calculated
upon incorrect assumptions shall be explicitly excluded, except in the case of
fraud (Arglist) or intentional misrepresentation.

| 
---|--- 

8.3

|

Notification of Sellers; Third-party Claim Procedure 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

In the event of an actual or potential breach of a Sellers\' Guarantee, the
Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably possible and in no event later than
twenty (20) Business Days following the discovery of such facts and
circumstances, notify the Sellers of such alleged breach in writing,
describing the potential claim in reasonable detail and, to the extent
practical, state the estimated amount of such claim and give the Seller the
opportunity to remedy the breach within the period of time indicated in Clause
8.2. In the event that in connection with an actual or alleged breach of a
Sellers\' Guarantee any claim or demand of a third party, including the
threatening of measures by authorities is asserted against the Purchaser or a
Group Company (each a Third-party Claim), the Purchaser shall 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

make available to the Sellers a copy of the Third-party Claim or demand and of
all time-sensitive documents and provide all information reasonably required
to investigate it, and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

give the respective Seller reasonable opportunity to comment or discuss with
the Purchaser any measures which the respective Seller proposes to take or
omit against such claim. The Purchaser shall have the right to defend the
claim by all appropriate proceedings, but must not admit any liability without
the prior consent of the respective Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld). 

In particular, the Purchaser shall be entitled to

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

lead all negotiations and correspondence with the third party, 

 

Page 41 of 64

2813477

SV\\\1613529.24

* * *


| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

appoint and instruct legal counsel to act for and on behalf of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries, 

provided that Purchaser shall consult with the respective Seller in good faith
about any such measures, and any decision about litigating or settling the
claim, or about mitigating the damage occurring shall be preceded by good
faith discussions with the respective Seller, with the Purchaser having due
regard to the concerns of the respective Seller.

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

The Purchaser undertakes not to, and to cause any of the Group Companies not
to settle a claim or permit any such acknowledgement or settlement without the
respective Seller's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the extent that such claims may result in a liability of the
respective Seller under this Agreement. The Purchaser undertakes to, and to
cause, if applicable, any of the Group Companies to reasonably cooperate with
the respective Seller in the defence of any third party claim, provide the
respective Seller and its representatives (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, its advisors) during normal business hours and after reasonable advance
notice with access to all relevant business records and documents of the Group
Companies. To the extent it turns out that a Seller is in breach of a Sellers'
Guaranty, all costs and expenses incurred by the respective Seller in
defending such claim shall be borne by the Sellers. If it turns out that the
Seller was not in breach, any external costs and expenses reasonably incurred
by such Seller in connection with the defence (e.g. advisors' fees) shall be
borne by the Purchaser. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

The failure of the Purchaser to fully comply with its obligations under this
Clause 8.3 shall release the respective Seller from its respective obligations
under Clause 7 and Clause 8 but only to the extent the Sellers' liability
increased as a result of such failure (cf. Clause 8.4(a)). 

| 
---|--- 

8.4

|

Exclusion of Remedies 

The Sellers shall not be liable, and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
bring any respective claim under or in connection with this Agreement, if and
to the extent that

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

the claim results from a failure of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or (after
Closing) of the Group Companies to mitigate damages pursuant to Section 254
para. 1 and para. 2 BGB; or 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

with respect to a breach of a Sellers' Gurantee, the underlying facts or
circumstances on which the liability or the claim is based were positively
known by the Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the Signing Date, whereby such
knowledge shall include - by definition but without limitation - any facts
Fairly Disclosed; or 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

the matter to which the claim relates has specifically been taken into account

Tax Reductions 

To the extent any circumstances triggering an obligation or liability of any
of the Sellers under or in connection with this Agreement should lead to a
reduced Tax burden of any of the Group Companies in the period beginning on
the Effective Date, 00:00 hours or the Purchaser, any such obligation or
liability of the Sellers shall be reduced by an amount equal to such reduction
provided that the payment of any of the Sellers in fulfillment of their
obligations or liabilities does not trigger Taxes.

|

8.6

|

No Double Indemnification 

To the extent any amount has actually been recovered from a Seller under any
Section of this Agreement or under statutory provisions, or to the extent that
a Seller has established a situation that would exist had a breach of the
Sellers' Guaranties under Clause 7 not occurred, any other claim with respect
to the same matter under any provision of this Agreement or any rule of law
shall be excluded. The same shall apply in respect of circumstances and
amounts which led to a reduction of the Purchase Price.

(c)

The Purchaser shall only be entitled to any claims for a breach of Sellers'
Guaranties under Clause 7 if and to the extent (i) each individual claim
against the respective Seller exceeds an amount of EUR 176,787.77 (in words:
Euro onehundred seventysixthousand sevenhundred eightyseven and seventyseven
Cents) (USD 200,000 converted at the EUR/USD exchange rate published by the
European Central Bank as of one day prior to the Signing Date (8:00 pm) into
Euro) (the De Minimis Amount, provided that claims resulting from Sellers\'
Breaches of the same or a similar source (Serienschaden) shall be aggregated
in order to determine whether the De Minimis Amount is reached)) and (ii) the
aggregate amount of all individual claims of the Purchaser against the
respective Seller which exceed the De Minimis Amount exceeds an amount of EUR
883,938.83 (in words: Euro eighthundred eightythreethousand ninehundred
thirtyeight and eightythree Cents) (USD 1,000,000 converted at the EUR/USD
exchange rate published by the European Central Bank as of one day prior to
the Signing Date (8:00 pm) into Euro) (the Threshold). In case the De Minimis
Amount and the Threshold are exceeded, the Purchaser can claim the entire
amount, not only the excess amount exceeding the Threshold (Freigrenze).

The De Minimis Amount and the Threshold shall not apply to the Exempt Claims.

(a)

|

The Sellers' aggregate liability for breaches of the Sellers\' Guarantees
shall be limited to an amount of EUR 17,678,776.63 (in words: Euro seventeen
million sixhundredseventyeightthousand sevenhundred seventysix and sixtythree
Cents) (USD 20,000,000 converted at the EUR/USD exchange rate published by the
European Central Bank as of one day prior to the Signing Date (8:00 pm) into
Euro) (the Liability Cap). The Liability Cap does not apply to liability for
breaches of the Sellers\' Guarantees set forth in Clause 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 and
7.5. For the avoidance of doubt the Liability Cap neither applies to other
Purchaser claims, including (i) any specific performance claims for transfer
of title to the Sold Shares (Erfullungsanspruche), (ii) any and all claims
under Clause 9 and Clause 11 (except for Clause 11.3(f)) and (iii) claims
arising pursuant to lit. (b) (all claims to which the Liability Cap does not
apply collectively, the Exempt Claims); provided, however, that the aggregate
liability of the Sellers for any and all claims under this Agreement
including, for the avoidance of doubt, distributions from the Escrow Account,
shall in no event exceed the amount of the Total Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

In the event of willful deceit (arglistige Tauschung) or other willful actions
(Vorsatz) of a Seller, the limitations on liability contained in Clauses 8.7
and 8.8(a) and the benefit of pro rata liability (Teilschuldnerschaft) shall
not apply to such Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, a willful deceit
(arglistige Tauschung) or other willful actions (Vorsatz) of a Seller, shall
not be imputed to the other Sellers. Willful deceit (arglistige Tauschung) or
other willful actions (Vorsatz) of persons assisting a Seller in the
performance of its contractual obligations (Erfullungsgehilfen) pursuant to
Section 278 BGB or of an advisor shall only be imputed to that Seller who
actually involved such assisting person or advisor, but not generally to other
or all Sellers, except where such assisting person or advisor was involved for
several or all Sellers (e.g. an advisor who represented several or all
Sellers).

|

Conduct of Purchaser's Claims 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If the Sellers are individually liable towards the Purchaser (Einzelschuldner)
as provided in Clause 16.2, the Purchaser shall not assert such claim against
the Escrow Account. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

If the Sellers are liable towards the Purchaser on a pro rata basis
(Teilschuldner), the Purchaser is entitled to, at Purchaser's choice, assert
such claim against the Escrow Account and/or the Sellers; provided, however,
that the Purchaser shall assert any such claim that is subject to the
Liability Cap against the Escrow Account to the extent the Escrow Account is
still funded, notwithstanding the Purchaser's right to claim the remaining
difference from the Sellers. If such claim against the Escrow Account is not
timely satisfied, the Purchaser shall remain entitled to claim the full amount
from the Sellers. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

For the avoidance of doubt, if and to the extent an Exempt Claim for which the
Sellers are liable on a pro rata basis (Teilschuldner) is asserted by the
Purchaser against the Escrow Account, any payment from the Escrow Account to
the Purchaser in performance of such claim shall not reduce the Liability Cap.

Tax Indemnification 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

Each Seller as an individual obligor (Teilschuldner) in accordance with Clause
16.2 shall pay to the Purchaser or, upon request of the Purchaser, the
relevant Group Company, on a pro rata basis pursuant to each Seller\'s Pro
Rata Share an amount equal to any Pre-Effective Date Taxes (the Tax
Indemnification Claim). Pre-Effective Date Taxes shall mean (i) any Taxes
which are imposed on any of the Group Companies by any Tax Authority relating
to the Sellers' Periods. Sellers' Period shall mean the taxable periods
(Veranlagungs- bzw. Erhebungszeitraume) ending on or before the day preceding
the Effective Date, 24:00 hours and (ii) with respect to a taxable period
beginning before and ending after the day preceding the Effective Date, 24:00
hours (the Straddle Period), that portion of such taxable period ending on the
day preceding the Effective Date, 24:00 hours. 

For purposes of this Clause 9, in the case of any Straddle Period, the amount
of Taxes to be allocated to the Sellers' Period shall be determined in
accordance with the following "as-if assessment" and shall be equal to:

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

In case of Taxes that are assessed on an annual basis and are not based upon
or related to income, such portion shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire Tax assessment period multiplied by a fraction, the 

 

Page 46 of 64

2813477

SV\\\1613529.24

* * *



numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax assessment period ending
on the day preceding the Effective Date, 24:00 hours and denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Tax assessment period.

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

In case of any Taxes based on or related to income or turnover such portion
shall be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on the day preceding the Effective Date, 24:00 hours. 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

In case of any other Taxes, the entire Tax, if and to the extent the matter of
facts (Steuertatbestand) of the respective Tax has been completely fulfilled
in the period ending on the day preceding the Effective Date, 24.00 hours, or
nil, if not. 

Deviating from sentence 1 with respect to Taxes which can be credited in favor
of any of the Sellers or any Related Party the Sellers shall be liable for the
Tax Indemnification Claim in accordance with the ratio between the fractional
amounts of the respective Tax each Seller or a Related Party of the respective
Seller is entitled to a Tax credit.

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to a Tax Indemnification Claim if and to
the extent that the Pre-Effective Date Taxes 

| 
---|--- 

(xv)

|

have been paid prior to the Effective Date; or 

| 
---|--- 

(xvi)

|

a Group Company (x) has recovered the respective Pre-Effective Date Taxes from
a third party (including any insurance policies) or (y) has a corresponding
claim for repayment, reimbursement or indemnification with respect to any Pre-
Effective Date Taxes from a third party (including any insurance policies) and
has not used reasonable efforts to collect such claim from a third party. The
recovered or recoverable amount pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
calculated as the gross amount recovered or recoverable from a third party
less any Taxes and expenses actually incurred by the respective Group Company
in connection with the recovered or recoverable amount; provided the Sellers
have fully paid the amount of the respective indemnifiable Tax, the Purchaser
will procure that the relevant Group Company will, upon request of the
Sellers, assign any claims for recovery from any third party to the Sellers;
or 

| 
---|--- 

(xvii)

|

arise from (i) any change in accounting and taxation principles or practice of
the Purchaser or any of the Group Companies (including methods or preparing or
submitting Tax Returns) for the period until the Effective Date introduced
after the Closing Date, or (ii) any merger or similar reorganization having
retroactive effect for the Sellers' Period involving any Group Company and
implemented after the Closing Date; sentence 1 of this Section (iii) shall not
apply if and to the extent the relevant act (i) was legally required under
mandatory law or its interpretation by the Tax Authorities, or (ii) has been
taken at the request of the Sellers; or 

|

result from or are increased by a breach by the Purchaser of its obligations
under Clause 9.4 (Filing of Tax Returns) and Clause 9.5 (Cooperation in Tax

have been taken into account in the Accounts as a liability (Verbindlichkeit)
for Taxes or provision (Ruckstellung) for Tax liabilities, even if part of
other liabilities, or provisions, to the extent these liabilities for Taxes
and provisions for Tax liabilities are listed in Schedule 9.2(b)(v); for the
avoidance of doubt, a liability or provision pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall not reduce a Tax Indemnification Claim if and to the extent the
amount of any such liability or provision has been paid to the Sellers
pursuant to Clause 9.3(d); or 

| 
---|--- 

(xx)

|

the Pre-Effective Date Taxes can or could have been avoided by offsetting
taxable profits against Tax losses (in particular in form of Tax loss
carrybacks or Tax loss carryforwards); for the avoidance of doubt, any
consumption or reduction of a Tax loss directly or indirectly caused by the
Purchaser or - after the Effective Date - by any of the Group Companies shall
be disregarded for the purpose of the existence of such offsetting opportunity
("as if calculation"); or 

| 
---|--- 

(xxi)

|

the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of the Group Companies obtains a
benefit in respect of Taxes within five (5) years after the Effective Date
(the Tax Benefit), including but not limited to benefits resulting from the
lengthening of any amortisation or depreciation periods, higher depreciation
allowances, a step-up in the Tax basis of assets or the non-recognition of
liabilities or provisions (Phasenverschiebung) as the result of an adjustment
or payment giving rise to a Tax Indemnification Claim. Tax Benefits arising
after the Effective Date shall be accounted for at their net present value.
The net present value is determined by applying a discount factor of four (4)
% and the applicable tax rate at the moment of the Tax Benefit. 

Any Tax Indemnification Claim shall become due and payable on the later of (i)
twenty (20) Business Days after the Purchaser has notified the Sellers in
writing about the payment obligation (attaching a copy of the relevant Tax
assessment notice or other payment notice of the Tax Authority, where
applicable) and (ii) five (5) Business Days before such Taxes are due and
payable to the relevant Tax Authority. The Sellers are entitled to make the
indemnification payment directly to the bank account of the Tax Authority, if
they inform the Purchaser thereof without undue delay. On request and at the
expense of the Sellers the Purchaser shall procure that the respective Group
Company makes its best efforts to achieve a deferred payment date, in
particular but not limited to the application for a suspension of enforcement
of tax payment obligation (Aussetzung der Vollziehung). If the Tax for which
an indemnification payment has been made is subsequently reduced, the
difference between the higher indemnification payment and the lower Tax amount
shall be reimbursed by the Purchaser to the Sellers (on a pro rata basis
pursuant to each Seller\'s Pro Rata Share), including all interests related
thereto. Clauses 9.3(b) and 9.3(c) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the
existence of any over-indemnification and the reimbursement obligation of the
Purchaser.

| 
---|--- 

9.3

|

Tax Refunds 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

After the Closing Date, the Purchaser undertakes to pay to the Sellers (on a
pro rata basis pursuant to each Seller's Pro Rata Share) any refund of Pre-
Effective Date Taxes relating to the Group Companies and received by the
Purchaser or any of the Group Companies after the Effective Date (including,
for the avoidance of 

 

Page 48 of 64

2813477

SV\\\1613529.24

* * *



doubt, resulting from a change of law after the Closing Date with retroactive
effect for the Sellers' Period) by receipt of cash payment, set-off or
deduction but only if and to the extent that such refund of Taxes has not
already been taken into account in the Accounts as an asset, except to the
extent such refunds have reduced an otherwise payable indemnity amount or
claim provided for under this Agreement (the Tax Refund).

| 
---|--- 

(j)

|

The Purchaser shall, and shall procure (steht dafur ein) that the Group
Companies will notify the Sellers within twelve (12) Business Days of any Tax
Refund. The Sellers are entitled to appoint a certified accounting firm, tax
advisory firm or law firm - at their own expense - to have the fulfilment of
the Purchaser's duties under this Clause 9.3 reviewed. Clause 9.5 shall apply
mutatis mutandis to such review. 

| 
---|--- 

(k)

|

Any Tax Refund shall be payable to the Sellers (on a pro rata basis pursuant
to each Seller's Pro Rata Share) within five (5) Business Days after actual
receipt of such Tax Refund (including by way of set-off or deduction). 

| 
---|--- 

(l)

|

The Purchaser undertakes to pay to the Sellers (on a pro rata basis pursuant
to each Seller's Pro Rata Share) any surplus of provisions for Taxes
(Steuerruckstellungen) or liabilities for Taxes (sonstige Verbindlichkeiten
aus Steuern) which are in each case recorded in the Accounts, to the extent
the amount of liabilities for Pre-Effective Date Taxes falls short of the
amount of the provisions for Taxes or the amount of the liabilities for Taxes
which are recorded in the Accounts and to the extent these liabilities for
Taxes and provisions for Tax liabilities are listed in Schedule 9.2(b)(v). Any
amount to be paid by the Purchaser under this Clause 9.3(d) shall be due and
payable within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of all Tax assessment
notices for the Seller Period. The Purchaser shall notify the Seller in
writing and without undue delay of any relevant decision by the Tax Authority
resulting in a claim under this lit (d). If a payment has been made pursuant
to this Clause 9.3(d) and the liabilities for Pre-Effective Date Taxes are
subsequently increased, the difference shall be reimbursed by the Sellers (on
a pro rata basis pursuant to each Seller\'s Pro Rata Share) to the Purchaser.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 9.3(d) shall not apply if and to the
exent the liability or provision pursuant to the preceding sentence has
reduced a Tax Indemnification Claim pursuant to Clause 9.2(b)(v). 

| 
---|--- 

9.4

|

Filing of Tax Returns 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Until the Closing Date, the Sellers shall procure (steht dafur ein) that (i)
Tax Returns of the Group Companies shall be prepared and filed in a timely
manner and in accordance with all applicable laws and past practice and (ii)
all Taxes payable under such Tax Returns are paid in a timely manner. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall procure (steht dafur ein) that the
Group Companies prepare and file when due all Tax Returns in line with past
practice provided (i) no changes are required in order to comply with
applicable rules under mandatory law or its interpretation by the Tax
Authorities and (ii) no changes have been taken at the request of the Seller
or to correct past misbehavior. To the extent that a Tax Return relates in
whole or in part to a Pre-Effective Date Tax or to a Tax for which the Sellers
may become liable under Clause 7.5 or Clauses 11.4(a) to 11.4(d) the Purchaser
shall submit a draft of such Tax Return to the Sellers for review no later
than thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. The

Purchaser shall procure (steht dafur ein) that the relevant Group Companies
(i), if and to the extent permitted by law, make any such amendments requested
by the Sellers and (ii) not submit any such Tax Return to any Tax Authority
without the prior consent of the Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not prohibit the Purchaser
and the Group Companies from paying any Taxes as they fall due under law or by
order of the Tax Authorities. The Sellers shall be deemed to have given their
consent to any such Tax Return timely submitted to them for their review if
the Sellers did not provide any comment with respect to the relevant Tax
Return to the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company until five (5) Business
Days prior to the due date of the Tax Return.

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall procure (steht dafur ein) that the
Group Companies do not amend any Tax Return that has been filed by the
relevant Group Company prior to or on the Closing Date and which relates to a
Pre-Effective Date Tax or to a Tax for which the Sellers may become liable
under Clause 7.5 or Clauses 11.4(a) to 11.4(d) without the Seller's prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless (i) such amendments
are required in order to comply with applicable rules under mandatory law, or
its interpretation by the Tax Authorities, or (ii) such amendments have been
taken at the request of the Seller or to correct past misbehavior. 

| 
---|--- 

9.5

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

The Parties agree to fully cooperate with each other in connection with any
Tax matter affecting the Group Companies and relating to the Sellers' Period
or a Tax for which the Sellers may become liable under Clause 7.5 or Clauses
11.4(a) to 11.4(d), including the preparation and filing of any Tax Return,
conduct of any audit, investigation, dispute, appeal or similar proceeding or
other communication with any Tax authority. Such cooperation shall include,
without limitation, providing or making available all relevant books, records
and documentation and the assistance of officers and employees. Unless
required otherwise by law, the Purchaser shall notify in writing the Sellers
without undue delay (unverzuglich), but at the latest six (6) Business Days
after the Purchaser or any Group Company became aware of such event of any
announcement and commencement of any administrative and judicial proceeding
relating to the Sellers' Period or a Tax for which the Sellers may become
liable under Clause 7.5 or Clauses 11.4(a) to 11.4(d) (collectively the
Relevant Tax Proceedings). The notification on the Relevant Tax Proceedings
shall contain copies of all documents received from a Tax Authority related to
the respective announcement or commencement of the Relevant Tax Proceedings.
The Purchaser shall procure (steht dafur ein) that the Sellers or a Tax
counsel appointed by it and bound to professional secrecy are given the
opportunity to duly participate in any audits by the Tax Authorities relating
to the Sellers' Period, in their preparation and any scheduled audit meetings
and written correspondence relating thereto, in each case at the Sellers' own
cost.

Purchaser shall procure that upon (i) request of at least one of the Sellers,
objections are filed and legal proceedings are instituted and conducted

of their obligations under Clause 9.4 and 9.5 or deny fulfillment of such
obligations (hereinafter the Failing Party), the respective other Party shall

Party is able to demonstrate that the other party was not prejudiced in a
material manner in avoiding the respective Taxes as a result of such non-
compliance. 

|

(f)

|

Claims of the Purchaser and the Sellers under this Clause 9 shall become time-
barred (verjahrt) for each claim

(g)

|

Any restrictions or limitations contained elsewhere in this Agreement (other
than in this Clause 9) shall not apply to any claims of the Purchaser pursuant

restricted by mentioning Clause 9 and, where applicable, the respective
subsection(s).
