and appoint additional arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, agents, lenders
and similar entities, to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a
portion of the financing commitments and to grant customary approval rights to
such additional arrangers and other entities in connection with such

Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the stockholders of Parent than the terms
of the Debt Financing Commitments (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Parent) (the &#147;<i>New Debt Commitments</i>&#148;); <i>provided</i>, that the New Debt Commitments shall not (i)&nbsp;adversely
amend the conditions to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments, in any material respect, (ii)&nbsp;reasonably be expected to delay

debt financing (unless, in the case of this clause (iii), such amount is
