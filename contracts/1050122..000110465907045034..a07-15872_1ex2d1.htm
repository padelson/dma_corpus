accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of
Merger and as is agreed to by the Company and Parent, being hereinafter

recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger.     

SECTION 1.3. _ Effects of the Merger._ From and after the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable

entirety to be the same as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than provisions

amended), and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its
terms and as provided by law.

SECTION 2.1. _ Conversion of Securities._ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

(a) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Common Stock_ " or " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 2.3(a)) and Shares referred to in Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted
into the right to receive $24.25 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ")
payable to the holder thereof, without interest, upon surrender of such
Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.4, less any required withholding
Taxes;

  

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically canceled and retired without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and

  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

        

SECTION 2.2. _ Options; Restricted Stock Units._

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution date of this
Agreement, the Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as are necessary (and such other
resolutions or actions, if any, in connection therewith as it may deem
appropriate) to provide that, as of the Effective Time (x) the Company shall
terminate its Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and its Amended
and Restated 1998 Incentive Stock Option Plan (collectively, the " _Stock
Incentive Plans_ ") and (y) by virtue of the Merger, without any further
action on the part of any holder of any Equity Incentive:

  

(i) each option (an " _Option_ ") to purchase Shares, whether granted
pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plans or otherwise, that is outstanding as of
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled, with the
holder of each such Option becoming entitled to receive an amount in
cash (the " _Option Consideration_ ") equal to the _product_ of (A) the
number of Shares subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to such
Option, less any required withholding Taxes; and

  

(ii) each share of restricted stock (" _Restricted Stock_ " and, together
with the Options, the " _Equity Incentives_ "), whether granted pursuant to
the Stock Incentive Plans or any other written agreement with the Company,
that is vested and outstanding as of the Effective Time, and each share of
Restricted Stock that is unvested as of the Effective Time and whose vesting
is, by its terms, accelerated to the Effective Time as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be canceled, with the holder of each
such share of Restricted Stock receiving, at the time of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to holders of Shares, an amount in cash (the "
_Restricted Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Option
Consideration, the " _Equity Incentive Consideration_ ") equal to the Merger
Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes. Each share of Restricted
Stock whose vesting is not, by its terms, accelerated to the Effective Time
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be canceled, with
the holder of each such share of Restricted Stock receiving the Restricted
Stock Consideration at the times set forth in the applicable Restricted Stock
Agreement governing the grant of any such share.

  

(b) The Board, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(b)(3) under the Exchange Act),
shall adopt a resolution before the Effective Time providing that the
disposition by officers and directors of Common Stock in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, and of Equity Incentives in exchange for the applicable
Equity Incentive Consideration, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, are intended to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  

SECTION 2.3. _ Dissenting Shares._

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which
are held by holders of Shares who have not voted in favor of the Merger and
who have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair
value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive,
withdraw or lose such holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such
holders Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the
Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor,
as set forth in Section 2.1 of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any appraisal demands
received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and

        

received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such
exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights
other than solely for an amount equal to or less than the Merger
Consideration per share.

  

SECTION 2.4. _ Surrender of Shares._

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement
with the Companys transfer agent to act as paying agent for the stockholders
of the Company (and, to the extent any Equity Incentive Consideration is not
paid at the Effective Time, shall appoint the same or such other agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent for the holders
of Equity Incentives) in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_
") to receive the Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the
Company shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II and the Equity
Incentive Consideration to which holders of Equity Incentives shall become
entitled upon cancellation thereof pursuant to this Article II. Immediately
prior to or simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments
pursuant to Sections 2.4(b) and 2.4(c). Such funds may be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (a) no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Common Stock or Equity Incentive Consideration payable hereunder to holders
of Equity Incentives and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of
the Company and the holders of Equity Incentives in the amount of any such
losses and (b) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the
United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America, or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available). Any interest or income
produced by, or profit resulting from, such investments will be payable to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event within five Business
Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of either (i) an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or book-entry shall then be canceled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered
shall be properly

        

endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or be accompanied
by all documents required to evidence transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.4(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Article II.

  

(c) All payments with respect to canceled Equity Incentives, to the extent
not made at the Effective Time, shall be made by the Paying Agent as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or
at the direction of Parent. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of Equity Incentives on the Equity Incentive Consideration
payable in respect thereof.

  

(d) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Equity
Incentives and, after such funds have been delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, such holders shall solely be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or with respect
to the Equity Incentive Consideration payable with respect to their canceled
Equity Incentives. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration and the payment of the Equity
Incentive Consideration. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Paying Agent will be liable to any Person entitled to payment under this
Article II for any consideration which is properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

(e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for in, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in, this Article II.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of
Shares or Equity Incentives pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly
withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Equity
Incentives, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be.

  

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement
requirements established by the Paying Agent, and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to
this Article II.

 **ARTICLE III. 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that,

fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2007 (other than disclosures in the "Risk
Factors" section of any such SEC Report or in the exhibits thereto) and (b)
on the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and
Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being understood that, in the case of clauses (a)
and (b), (i) any information set forth in one section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other
section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent that such information is relevant to such other section or
subsection and (ii) no information shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of
Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.17, 3.18, 3.22 and 3.23 unless specifically

SECTION 3.1. _ Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries._ The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except, in the case of any such Subsidiary, where any such failure
to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power or
authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where any such failure
to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. " _Material Adverse Effect_
" means any change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or state of facts
that, individually or in the aggregate, is or would reasonably likely to be
(A) materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (B)
materially adverse to the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following, or
any changes, effects, events, circumstances, occurrence or state of facts
relating to or resulting therefrom, shall be deemed in themselves, either
alone or in combination, to constitute, and none of them shall be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or could or would be, a
Material Adverse Effect pursuant to clause (A) above: (i) economic, financial
market, or geopolitical conditions in general, (ii) general changes or
developments in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries (or
their respective customers) operate, (iii) the announcement of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that any
adverse change in the Companys supply relationships following the
announcement of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a change, effect,
event, circumstance, occurrence or state of facts relating to or resulting
from such announcement), (iv) any actions required under this Agreement, (v)
changes in any laws or regulations or applicable accounting regulations or
principles or interpretations thereof (so long as such changes were either
published in the Federal Register prior to the date of this Agreement or were
otherwise publicly proposed by the applicable Governmental Entity in one or
more releases or notices published prior to the date of this Agreement), (vi)
changes in the market price or trading volume of the Common Stock or the
failure, in and of itself, by the Company to meet any expected or projected
financial or operating performance target, as well as (in and of itself) any
change by the Company in any expected or projected financial or operating
performance target (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving
rise or contributing to such change or failure may be deemed to constitute
and may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or could
or would be a Material Adverse Effect), (vii) acts of God, national or
international hostilities, war (whether or not declared) or terrorism or
(viii) any litigation brought or threatened by the stockholders of the
Company (whether on

        

behalf of the Company or otherwise) arising out of or in connection with the
existence, announcement or performance of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, unless, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and
(vii) above, such changes, effects, events, circumstances, occurrence or
state of facts have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other participants in the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

  

SECTION 3.2. _ Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ The Company has
heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, each as currently in effect. The
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and no other organizational
documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are
in violation of any provisions of their respective certificate of
incorporation or bylaws in any material respect.

Company consists of (i) 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock and (ii)
1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, (i)

of its Subsidiaries or the revenues, earnings or financial performance, stock
performance or any other attribute of the Company, in each case, to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Except as set forth in this
Agreement, there are not, any stockholder agreements, registration rights
agreements, voting agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or

Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and all such shares are owned by the Company free and clear of
all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in

any Subsidiary of the Company, any outstanding or authorized (I) shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of such Subsidiary, (II) securities
of such Subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital
stock or voting securities of such Subsidiary or (III) options or other
rights to acquire from such Subsidiary, and there is no obligation of such
Subsidiary to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of
such Subsidiary. Except for the capital stock or other ownership interests of
its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, (i) any

SECTION 3.4. _ Authority._ The Company has all necessary corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Company Requisite Vote
(as defined below). Assuming the accuracy of Parents representations and
warranties in Section 4.9, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceeding on the part of
the Company is necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions so contemplated (other than adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Shares (the " _Company
Requisite Vote_ ") and the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent
and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally, general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing. As of the date of this Agreement, the Board has
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The only vote of the stockholders of the Company
required to adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated
hereby is the Company Requisite Vote.

  

SECTION 3.5. _ No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._

consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not (i) conflict
with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company,
(ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by
clauses (i) through (iv) of subsection (b) below have been obtained, and all
filings described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate
any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective
properties are bound or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, the
creation of any claim, lien, charge, security interest or encumbrance of any
nature whatsoever under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, amendment or acceleration (each, a " _Violation_ ") of, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit
or other instrument or obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ") or Company Plan
(as defined in Section 3.10(a)) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
its or any of their respective properties are bound, except, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict, violation, breach, default,
loss, right or other occurrence which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or
notification to, any governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange or
self-regulatory organization) authority, agency, court commission, arbitrator
or other governmental body (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), except for
(i) applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF 
 PARENT AND MERGER SUB**

  

Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Company that, except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by
Parent and Merger Sub to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being understood that
any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other section or

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is incorporated and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or
in good standing or to have such power or authority would not, individually
or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent owns
beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub
free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements,
limitations in voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever. Prior to the date hereof, Parent has provided to the Company the

necessary action by the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and,
immediately upon the execution hereof, will be duly and validly authorized by
written consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to

   

18     

authorize this Agreement, to perform their respective obligations hereunder,
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally, general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing.

  

SECTION 4.3. _ No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._

filings described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate
any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub or by which either of them or any of their respective properties
are bound or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any
Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or
Merger Sub or its or any of their respective properties are bound, except, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict, violation, breach,
default, acceleration, loss, right or other occurrence which would not
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Financing) by each of
Parent and Merger Sub do not and will not require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except for (i) the applicable requirements, if any, of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
HSR Act and state securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws, (ii) the filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL and (iii) any such consent, approval,
authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to
make or obtain would not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 4.4. _ Absence of Litigation._ There are no suits, claims,
actions, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or investigations pending or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than any such suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation that would not, or would not reasonably be expected to,
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is or are
subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award that would,
or would reasonably be expected to, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

be supplied by, or on behalf of, Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
and Merger Sub make no

   

19     

representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its representatives which is contained or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements

complete copies of (i) an executed commitment letter, dated as of June 3,
2007, among Parent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. has agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt
Financing_ "), and (ii) an executed equity commitment letter, dated as of
June 3, 2007 between Parent and Fenway Partners Capital Fund III, L.P. (the "
_Equity Financing Commitments_ " and, together with the Debt
Financing Commitments, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which
Fenway Partners Capital Fund III, L.P. has committed to invest the amount set

and made available to the Company all other agreements, arrangements
or understandings (whether written or oral) related to the Financing. None of

this Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the
Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect
prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are legal, valid and
binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any
term or condition of the Financing Commitments. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and shall in the future pay any such fees as they become due.
The aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements
contemplated by the Financing Commitments when delivered in accordance with
the terms of the Financing Commitments will be sufficient for Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Equity
Incentive Consideration and to pay all related fees and expenses. As of the
date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III hereof and the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent
on the Closing Date.

  

SECTION 4.8. _ Capitalization of Merger Sub; Operations of Parent and
Merger Sub._ The authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 100
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly
issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of

Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other
agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire
any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has been formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to
the Effective Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will
have incurred no liabilities or obligations other than in connection herewith
or as contemplated herein.

"Affiliates" or "Associates" directly or indirectly "owns," and neither
Parent nor any of Parents Affiliates directly or indirectly has ever
"owned," beneficially or otherwise, any Shares (other than those Shares
acquired from current stockholders of the Company who will exchange such
Shares for equity of Parent or one of Parents Affiliates), as those terms
are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to
approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub
necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 4.11. _ WARN Act._ Parent and Merger Sub are neither planning
nor contemplating, and Parent and Merger Sub have neither made nor taken, any
decisions or actions concerning the Company Employees after the Closing that
would require the service of notice under the Worker Adjustment Retraining
Notification Act or similar local laws.

  

SECTION 4.12. _ Solvency._ As of the Effective Time, assuming (A) the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the
Merger (or waiver of such conditions) and (B) that the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement (and the bring down
thereof in any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to Section
7.2(c)) are true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any

Agreement (including any financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby), (i) none of the Surviving Corporation or any of its

(including the probable amount of all contingent liabilities) and its
respective debts as they become absolute and matured, (ii) the assets of each
of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, in each case at a

information provided to the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

mailing of the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company), the
Company, acting through the Board, shall (i) take all action necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for
the purpose of adopting this Agreement (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), (ii)
subject to the right of the Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board that the
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and, subject to the approval of the Financial Advisor, as applicable, the
written opinion of the Financial Advisor, dated as of the date hereof, that,
as of such date, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of the Common Stock and (iii) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote.

  

SECTION 6.2. _ Proxy Statement._ As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare in accordance
with the provisions of the Exchange Act and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement. Parent and Merger Sub will cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the
information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC and mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable
after such filing, including by responding as soon as reasonably practicable
to any SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall as
soon as reasonably practicable notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request
by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the

        

Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand. The Company shall provide Parent with the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement (including each amendment
or supplement thereto) and all responses to requests for additional
information by and replies to comments of the SEC (provided that the Company
shall (i) include in any such documents or responses all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent and (ii) not file, mail or otherwise deliver such document
or respond to the SEC or the staff of the SEC over Parents reasonable
objection) prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and the
Company will provide Parent with copies of all such filings made and
correspondence with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information should be discovered by any party hereto which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by
applicable law, the parties will cooperate with each other in connection with
the preparation of an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information, which amendment or supplement will be promptly filed by the
Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of
the Company.

  

SECTION 6.3. _ Resignation of Directors._ At the Closing, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of all directors of the
Company and all directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case,
effective at the Effective Time.

  

SECTION 6.4. _ Access to Information; Confidentiality._

  

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries,
officers, directors and employees to, afford the officers, employees,
auditors and other authorized representatives of Parent (the "
_Representatives_ ") reasonable access, consistent with applicable law,
during normal business hours to its officers, employees, properties, offices,
plants and other facilities (which shall not include any environmental
testing or sampling) and to all books and records, and shall furnish Parent
with all financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may
from time to time reasonably request in writing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their
normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement. It is agreed that the parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the previous sentence apply.

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case, in accordance with the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

  

SECTION 6.5. _ Acquisition Proposals._

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.5(b), the Company shall, and the Company shall cause
its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively with the
Subsidiaries of the Company, the " _Company Representatives_ ") to, from the
date

        

hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, not (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information or providing access to its properties, books, records or
personnel) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal (other than with Parent and
its Representatives), (iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any agreement, understanding, arrangement or agreement in principle providing
for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
agreement, understanding, arrangement or agreement in principle requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or (iv) exempt any
person from the restrictions contained in any state takeover or similar laws,
including Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
negotiation with any Persons conducted heretofore by the Company or any
Company Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly inform the Company Representatives of the obligations of the
Company under this Section 6.5(a)

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.5(a),
prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, if, in response to a written
bona fide Acquisition Proposal from any Person not solicited in violation of
this Section 6.5, the Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith
(i) after consultation with its financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses
(x) and (y) below with respect to such Acquisition Proposal could be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may,
in response to such Acquisition Proposal, (x) furnish information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal, pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) participate in discussions and
negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the
Company will promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours of providing such
information to such Person) provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person
which was not previously provided to Parent. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person or
"group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other
than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, a business that constitutes 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues or income of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 20% or
more of the Shares then outstanding, any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or
more of the Shares then outstanding, and any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the
Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the consolidated revenues,
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries), other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal (with all
percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 50%) that
is on terms that the Board or any committee thereof determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
counsel, and after taking into account all appropriate legal, financial
(including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory or other
aspects of such proposal as it deems relevant)) (i) would, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company, from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) is capable of being, and is reasonably likely to be,
completed. For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means an agreement that contains provisions to keep nonpublic
information confidential which

        

are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Non-
Disclosure Agreement (it being understood that such agreement need not
contain comparable standstill provisions).

  

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 6.5, neither the Board nor any
committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
approval or recommendation by the Board or any committee thereof of the
Merger or this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Board or any committee thereof may modify
or withdraw such recommendation if the Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law (regardless of whether an Acquisition Proposal has been made
at any time); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ");
(iii) allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter
of intent, acquisition agreement or any similar agreement or understanding
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (A) constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to result
in, any Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; or (iv) effect any transaction contemplated by any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be prohibited
from terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5, if, prior
to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company has received a Superior
Proposal that has not been withdrawn or abandoned, the Board or any committee
thereof may (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (a " _Permitted Alternative Agreement_ "); _provided_
, that the Board or any such committee has concluded, in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board or such committee to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement, as the case
may be, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
_provided_ , _however_ that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless
concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee and
Expenses (as defined in Section 8.2(b)) payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b).
No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Board for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(e) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall (i) keep Parent
generally informed on a current basis (and in any event, within 24 hours of
any such material development) of the existence or status of and material
developments respecting any solicitations, inquiries, proposals and/or
negotiations (excluding the identity of each Person making any such inquiry,
solicitation or proposal, but including the material terms and price in
respect of any Acquisition Proposal), (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable (and in any event, within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery
thereof with copies of all written Acquisition Proposals sent by or provided
to the Company or any Company Representatives from any Person or, at the
Companys election, a written summary of the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) provide notice to Parent of any intent to
take any of the actions described in Section 8.1(e)(ii) or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.5(d). The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company
from providing such information to Parent.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board, after

        

consultation with outside counsel, such disclosure is required to fulfill the
Boards fiduciary duties or is otherwise required under applicable law.

  

SECTION 6.6. _ Employment and Employee Benefits Matters._

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, unless consented to by the Companys chief executive
officer or as are required to provide for the exemption from or otherwise to
comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first ****
anniversary thereof, to provide severance and other separation-related
payments and benefits not less favorable, in any case, than those provided
for under the severance- or separation-related provisions of the Company
Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time for any Company
Employee employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the date
hereof whose employment terminates during that 12-month period in
circumstances entitling such Company Employee to payments or benefits under
such severance- or separation-related provisions as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for the Company
Employees who remain employed compensation and benefit levels that are, in
the aggregate, no less favorable to the compensation and benefits that were
provided in the aggregate to the Company Employees prior to the Effective
Time, disregarding stock-based compensation and benefits.

  

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give each Company Employee credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and accruals of vacation and sick leave benefits under
plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of
Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (each, a " _New Plan_ ") for the Company Employees
service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities to
the same extent recognized by the Company and the applicable Company Plan or
Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each New Plan
that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),
Parent or its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing
condition or eligibility exclusions or limitations and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees
under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time or immediately prior to the date the
New Plan is later made available to Company Employees.

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will honor, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its
terms, (x) each existing employment, change in control, severance and
termination plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of that company and (y)
all obligations pursuant to all outstanding bonus plans or programs and all
accrued benefits under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of
the Company or its Subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and
benefit arrangements and agreements in effect as of the Effective Time.

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.6 or otherwise in this Agreement shall be
construed as limiting the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or it
Subsidiaries, upon and following the Effective Time to amend or terminate
any Company Plan in accordance with its term, nor shall any provision hereof
be construed as an amendment of the terms of any Company Plan or as
conferring on any individual rights with respect to any Company Plan.

   

28  

   

SECTION 6.7. _ Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any employment agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time
through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to,
indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and
former officer or director of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_
"), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of all expenses incurred in
the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation within ten Business Days of receipt by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced has
provided an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
adjudicated that such Person is not entitled to indemnification; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of
the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (y) neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such proceeding or
threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents, and (z) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate in the defense of any such matter.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to, but not obligated
to, participate at their own expense in the defense and settlement of any
such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement agreed to or effected without
the Surviving Corporations written consent.

  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals.

  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i)
cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, with a claims period of six years from the
Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope and on terms at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Companys current
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) maintain at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect
for six years from the Effective Time, the current policies of the directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ ,
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not
less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement) with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this

        

Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby); _provided_
, that the Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an annual
premium therefor in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to
the date hereof, which the Company represents and warrants to be $348,069
(the " _Current Premium_ "), and that if the existing directors
and officers liability insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during
such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation will use reasonable efforts
to obtain as much directors and officers liability insurance as can be
obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium on an annualized
basis not in excess of 300% of the Current Premium. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.7
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in Section 6.6 and this Section 6.7. In addition,
the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this
Section 6.7.

  

SECTION 6.8. _ Further Action; Efforts._

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible following
the date hereof. Each party hereto shall cooperate and use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation to
effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other
documents, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (and will cooperate
with each other in obtaining) any consent, acquiescence, authorization, order
or approval of, or any exemption or nonopposition by, any Governmental Entity
required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates in connection with the Merger or the taking of
any other action contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time any consent,
approval or waiver from third parties necessary to allow the Company and its
Subsidiaries to continue operating their businesses as presently conducted as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of subsection (a)
above, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable, and in any event within ten Business Days of the date hereof,
duly file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_
") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust
Division_ ") the notification and report form required under the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested under the HSR Act and use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all other

        

actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 6.8. Each
of Parent and the Company shall (i) promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or
any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable under
the circumstances, after consultation with the other party, to any
inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional
information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests received from
either Governmental Entity, (iii) not participate, or permit their Affiliates
to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it so consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate, (iv) not extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (v) not
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 6.8, Parent and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any
injunction, judgment, order or decree that would restrain, prevent or delay
the Closing, including, with respect to Parent, Parents taking all such
actions, including (y) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Company or Parent (or any
of their respective Subsidiaries) and (z) otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that limit the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of its or its Subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets,
in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other
order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Closing.

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
continued in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 6.8, the
Company and the Board shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts to take
all action necessary or otherwise reasonably requested by Parent or Merger
Sub to exempt the Merger from the provisions of any applicable takeover,
business combination, control share acquisition or similar law and (ii) if
any takeover, business combination, control share acquisition or similar
law becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, use their reasonable
best efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on the Merger.

  

SECTION 6.9. _ Public Announcements._ The Company and Parent will
consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, except as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement
with, or any rules of, a national securities exchange, in which case the
issuing party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with
the other party before it issues any such press release or makes any such
public statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to any matter addressed in Section 6.5.

  

SECTION 6.10. _ Financing._

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their Affiliates to use,
their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Commitments, including to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate and enter into

        

definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth therein to be
fulfilled by Parent and Merger Sub that are within their control (including
by consummating the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing
Commitments) and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing. In the
event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly notify the Company and shall use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain alternative financing (such alternative financing, " _Alternative
Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event; _provided_ , that Parent
and Merger Sub shall be under no obligation to obtain such
Alternative Financing unless it can be obtained on terms which are in the
aggregate no less favorable to Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
stockholders of Parent than the terms of the Debt Financing Commitments.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any
party to the Financing Commitments of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware or any termination of commitments under the Debt Financing Commitments.
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain the Debt Financing.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, without the Companys prior written
consent, agree to or permit any amendment, modification, supplement,
replacement or waiver (other than a waiver of a condition to the Financing)
of any of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to
the Financing in a manner that would materially and adversely affect the
likelihood that the Financing contemplated thereby will be obtained.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may amend, restate,
modify, supplement or replace the Financing Commitments to (i) add and
appoint additional arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, agents, lenders and
similar entities, to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a portion
of the financing commitments and to grant customary approval rights to such
additional arrangers and other entities in connection with such appointments,
(ii) increase the amount of indebtedness or (iii) replace one or more
facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments with one or more
new facilities, which are in the aggregate no less beneficial to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the stockholders of Parent than the terms of the

of Parent) (the " _New Debt Commitments_ "); _provided_ , that the New Debt
Commitments shall not (i) adversely amend the conditions to the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments, in any material
respect, (ii) reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, or
(iii) reduce the aggregate amount of available debt financing (unless, in the
case of this clause (iii), such amount is replaced with any amount of new
equity financing or one or more debt facilities pursuant to the New Debt
Commitments). Upon and from and after each such event, the term "Debt
Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to mean the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments that is not so superseded at
the time in question and the New Debt Commitments.

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their representatives to provide, such cooperation in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, provided that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, due
diligence, lender presentations and other presentations, including
presentations with rating agencies, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to
furnish Parent, Merger Sub and their financing sources with all financial
statements, financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company,

may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing
or Alternative Financing, (iii) assisting Parent, Merger Sub and their
financing sources in (A) the preparation of offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda and similar documents in
connection with any portion of the Debt Financing or

        

Alternative Financing, (B) the preparation of materials for lender and rating
agency presentations, and (C) the compliance with requirements of rating
agencies, (iv) cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent, Merger Sub
and their financing sources for any portion of the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing, (v) facilitating the pledging of collateral, including
obtaining appraisals, financial analyses, surveys, environmental assessments,
third party consents and estoppels, mortgage financeability and title
insurance, in each case at Parents and Merger Subs expense, (vi) taking
such actions to satisfy any requirements necessary to consummate the Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing (but solely to the extent within the
control of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and otherwise, assisting and
cooperating with the satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing,
including as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments, or Alternative
Financing, (vii) entering into one or more credit or other agreements on
terms satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing immediately prior to (but conditioned upon the
occurrence of) the Effective Time, and (viii) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to
permit the consummation of the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing and
the direct borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing, by the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and
several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective representatives from and against any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith. The
Company hereby consents to use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Financing and the Alternative Financing; _provided_
that such logos are used solely in a manner that does not or is not
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
its or their marks.

  

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent pursuant to Section 6.10(b) shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Non-Disclosure Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent and its Representatives shall be permitted to
disclose information to the providers of, and as necessary and consistent

pursuant to this sentence shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Termination Fee or any subsequent Expenses pursuant to

Expenses to be paid shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by any payment by the
Company of the Expenses pursuant to this sentence up to $1,500,000, and the

such Termination Fee shall be increased to $13,774,000 in the event that
Parent or Merger Sub has willfully breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth herein (provided that if

the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing, neither Parent or Merger Sub
shall be deemed to have willfully breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth herein unless Parent or

Fee and/or the Expenses required pursuant to Section 8.2(b) when due or
Parent shall fail to pay the Termination Fee required pursuant to Section
8.2(c) when due, the Termination Fee and/or Expenses then due shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such amount or amounts were
due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., in the City of New York from time to time during such
period, as such banks prime lending rate. In the event that the Company
shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Expenses when due or Parent shall
fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, **** shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and
expenses actually incurred by such other party (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection of such fee and the

in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

SECTION 8.5. _ Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the

waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of
any party to assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights or remedies.

to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are

such party is entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties

Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court

jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section

any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in Section 9.2 shall be effective service of
process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Merger.

  

SECTION 9.11. _ Sponsor Guaranty._ Parent has delivered to the Company a
guaranty (the " _Guaranty_ ") of Fenway Partners Capital Fund III, L.P. (the
" _Guarantor_ ") with respect to the full and complete performance by Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, of its respective obligations under Section
8.2(c) of this Agreement. Parent represents and warrants that the Guaranty is
in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor. Except for the termination rights provided in Section 8.1, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy for any
claim asserted by the Company against the Guarantor or any of its Affiliates
(other than Parent or Merger Sub), including any claim that arises out of or
relates in any way to the negotiation, entry into, performance, or the terms
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or the breach or
claimed breach thereof, shall be limited to the remedy as agreed to in the
Guaranty, and such remedy shall only be available if this Agreement shall
have been terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii). Upon
payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2(c), none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any of their Affiliates shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including with respect to any claim
that arises out of or relates in any way to the negotiation, entry into,
performance, or the terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or the breach or claimed breach thereof.

  

SECTION 9.12. _ Interpretation._ When reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" will be inclusive
and not exclusive unless the

agreements, documents, instruments or laws defined or referred to in this
Agreement will be deemed to mean or refer to such agreements, documents,
instruments or laws as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (i) in the case of agreements, documents or instruments, by waiver
or consent and (ii) in the case of laws, by succession of comparable
successor statutes. All references in this Agreement to any particular law
will be deemed to refer also to any rules and regulations promulgated under
