(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub as

the form of certificate of incorporation as set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ A_
hereto, until further amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable Law.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, until their successors have been

action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any securities of the

Merger Sub), the Company or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (including
shares held as treasury stock or otherwise) immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



17

    

(b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares ( _i_ ) to be canceled in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_, and ( _ii_ ) subject to the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_) shall at the Effective Time automatically be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to the provisions
of this _Article II_.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock converted into
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of ( _i_ )
a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or ( _ii_ ) shares of
Company Stock held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except (subject to  _Section_ __ _

and ( _ii_ ) any unpaid dividends declared in accordance with this Agreement
in respect of such Company Stock with a record date prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par

Section 2.6 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this

reverse stock split), recapitalization, subdivision, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock
dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then
the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case
may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of
Company Stock (including Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Stock)
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall be construed to permit any
Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.7 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_) and that are held by any Person who
is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect
of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Appraisal
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of
the "fair value" of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the
"fair value" of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares

 



18

    

 shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for, the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company
Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company. Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

Section 2.8 _Exchange of Company Stock_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary
exchange agreement with a nationally recognized bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying_
_Agent_ "). Prior to or as of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or
shall cause to be provided to the Paying Agent cash in an aggregate amount
necessary to pay the Merger Consideration for all shares converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof
(such cash, the " _Payment_ _Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall deliver the
Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ out of the
Payment Fund. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.8(g)_, the Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_,
( _x_ ) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary
form) and ( _y_ ) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, cash in an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Stock previously represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

 



19

    

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled
to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, cash in an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock
previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, and the Book-Entry Shares of
such holder shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

(c) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms
of this _Article II_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately,
in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the
former holders of Company Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former
holder of Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article
II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
its claim for the Merger Consideration (subject to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law).

 

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from
the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as
Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against

 



20

    

 it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration that would be payable or deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income or gain or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock. Any
interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and
no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit
of holders of Company Stock; _provided_ , _further_ , that any investment of
such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of,
or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by,
the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10
billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are
then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this
_Article II_. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment
Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to
be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 

Section 2.9 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right,
title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

Section 2.10 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and cease at
the Effective Time to represent an option with respect to shares of Company
Stock, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to
receive a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of
( _i_ ) the total number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the excess, if any, of ( _A_ ) the Merger
Consideration over ( _B_ ) the exercise price per share of such Company Stock
Option, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable
withholding. Any such payment shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of common stock
that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled
at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 



21

    

(b) _Company RSUs_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, shall automatically become immediately vested, and each Company RSU
shall be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent a right with
respect to shares of Company Stock and shall be converted, without any action
on the part of any holder thereof, into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation a cash payment equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the total
number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company RSUs multiplied
by ( _ii_ ) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon
and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be paid in
a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Company PSUs_. As of the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
become immediately vested with performance conditions for each open
performance period as of the Closing deemed achieved at "target" level of
performance (as set forth in the applicable award agreement), and each
Company PSU shall be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent a
right with respect to shares of Company Stock and shall be converted, without
any action on the part of any holder thereof, into the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation a cash payment equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the
resulting vested number of shares of Company Stock then underlying each such
Company PSU multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment
shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time
but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective
Time.

 

(d) _Company DSUs_. Each Company DSU that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and converted, without
any action on the part of any holder thereof, into the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation a cash payment equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the
total number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company DSU
multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon
and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be paid in a
lump sum at the Effective Time in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code.

(e) _Certain Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of the
Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Company DSUs as provided
in this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_.

 

Section 2.11 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each
unexercised Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a Parent Warrant in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.11_.

 

Section 2.12 _Withholding_. Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation (and any agent acting on behalf of any of them, including the
Paying Agent), as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement

 



22

    

 to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable provisions of state,
local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted
to the applicable Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit under any provision of any Contract to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is party or which is binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or assets or any license,
franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization
affecting Parent and its Subsidiaries or ( _d_ ) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien, other than any Permitted Lien, on any property or
asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of
_clauses_ __ _ (b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ , as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5 _Merger Sub_. Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger.
Since the date of its incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried, and prior to
the Effective Time will not carry, on any business or conduct any
operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

 



43

    

Section 4.6 _Litigation_. Except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, there is no ( _a_ ) Proceeding or investigation pending (or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any Governmental Authority
with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, ( _b_ ) Proceeding pending
(or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority or ( _c_ ) Order against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties.

Section 4.7 _Share Ownership_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) any Company Stock or any options, warrants
or other rights to acquire Company Stock or other securities of, or any other
economic interest (through derivatives, securities or otherwise) in the
Company.

 

Section 4.8 _Solvency_. Parent and Merger Sub are not entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming ( _a_ )
that the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ have
been satisfied or waived, ( _b_ ) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_ and ( _c_ )
the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent as of immediately after the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ", when used with respect to
any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, ( _i_ ) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed the sum of ( _A_ ) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and ( _B_ ) the amount that will
be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person, as of such date,
on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such
debts become absolute and mature, ( _ii_ ) such Person will not have, as of
such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date, and ( _iii_ ) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of
such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For
purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

 

Section 4.9 _Financing_.

 

(a) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the
Company true, complete and correct copy of the fully executed debt commitment
letter, together with any related fee letters (with only the fee amount,
economic flex and certain other economic terms redacted in a customary manner
(none of which could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect conditionality, enforceability or termination provisions of the
Commitment Letter or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing)),
dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and

 



44

    

 among the Financing Sources named therein and Parent providing for debt
financing as described therein (together, including all exhibits, schedules
and annexes, the " _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, each of the Financing Sources
named therein has agreed, severally but not jointly, to lend the amounts set
forth therein, for the purpose of, among other things, paying the aggregate
Merger Consideration. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter
is in full force and effect and constitutes the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, in each case, subject to
the Enforceability Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, other than the conditions precedent set forth in the
Commitment Letter (such conditions precedent, the " _Financing Conditions_ ").

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter has not been
amended or modified in any manner, and the respective commitments contained
therein have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, and
no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated by
Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, other than to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar
entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ and mandatory
reductions expressly contemplated thereby. As of the date of this Agreement,
assuming the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and  _Section_ __ _
8.2_ will be satisfied, Parent has no reason to believe that ( _i_ ) any of
the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date
or ( _ii_ ) the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter will not be
available to Parent on the Closing Date.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not in default or breach
under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or other agreements
or arrangements (other than customary fee credit letters and engagement
letters) affecting the availability of the full amount of the Financing to
which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party, other than those set forth
in the Commitment Letter and the fee letters related to the Commitment
Letter delivered to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.9(a)_. Parent
or an Affiliate thereof on its behalf has fully paid any and all commitment or
other fees and amounts required by the Commitment Letter to be paid on or
prior to the date of this Agreement.

(d) Assuming that ( _i_ ) the parties to the Commitment Letter (other
than Parent or Merger Sub) perform their obligations in accordance with the
terms of the Commitment Letter and ( _ii_ ) the satisfaction or waiver of the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ hereof, Parent will have
at and as of the Closing Date sufficient available funds to satisfy all of
Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement and under the
Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any payments in respect of
equity compensation obligations to be made in connection with the Merger, any
repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of Parent, the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by, or required in
connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or the
Commitment Letter and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement
and associated costs and expenses of the Merger and the transactions 

 



45

    

 contemplated thereby (such amounts, collectively, the " _Merger Amounts_ ").
As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that the
representation contained in the immediately preceding sentence will not be
true at and as of the Closing Date. In no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any
other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent
or Merger Sub hereunder.

 

Section 4.10 _Information_ _Supplied_. The information relating to Parent
and its Subsidiaries to be contained in, or incorporated by reference in, the
Proxy Statement, including any amendments or supplements thereto and any other
document incorporated or referenced therein, will not, on the date the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of any
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _
4.10_, no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect
to information or statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement that were not supplied by or on behalf of Parent for use therein.

 

Section 4.11 _No Additional Representations; Limitation on Warranties_.
Except for the representations and warranties expressly made by Parent and
Merger Sub in this _Article_ __ _ IV_, neither Merger Sub nor any other
Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty whatsoever.
Parent has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition
and technology of the Company and acknowledges that Parent has been provided
access to personnel, properties, premises and records of the Company for such
purposes. In entering into this Agreement, except as expressly provided
herein, Parent has relied solely upon its independent investigation and
analysis of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that it has not
been induced by and has not relied upon any representations, warranties or
statements, whether express or implied, made by the Company or any of its
directors, officers, stockholders, employees, affiliates, agents, advisors or
representatives that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement, whether
or not such representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or
orally.

Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

 

(b) Parent will take all actions necessary to ( _i_ ) cause Merger Sub to
perform when due its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and ( _ii_ ) ensure that Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time
shall not conduct any business, incur or guarantee any indebtedness or make
any investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.3 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless
each former and present director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs,
expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any

 



52

    

 actual or threatened claim to the fullest extent permitted by Law),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim with respect to
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an
officer, director, or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the request of or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation, bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any
indemnification agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement and made
available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. All
rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of
expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, in effect as of the date of this Agreement in favor of
the Company Indemnified Parties shall survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all the
terms thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Company
Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall continue in effect with respect to such
matter until the final disposition of all claims relating thereto. No Company
Indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or threatened claim in respect of which
indemnification has been sought by such Company Indemnified Party hereunder
without the prior written consent of Parent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 

(b) For a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, shall cause to
be maintained in effect the provisions in the certificates of incorporation
and bylaws and comparable organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and each Subsidiary of the Company (or in such documents of any
successor thereto) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and
advancement of expenses no less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties
than in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, during such
six (6) year period, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individual who immediately before the Effective Time was a Company
Indemnified Party, except as required by applicable Law.

(c) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either ( _i_
) continue to maintain in effect for a period of no less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time the Companys directors and officers and fiduciary
(ERISA) insurance policies (the " _D andO __and ERISA_ _Insurance_ ") in place
as of the date of this Agreement or ( _ii_ ) purchase comparable DandO and ERISA
Insurance (from carriers with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys DandO and ERISA Insurance carriers) for such six (6) year period, in
each case, with coverage for the persons who are covered by the Companys
existing DandO and ERISA Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the
Companys existing DandO and ERISA Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in

 



53

    

 excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount per annum the Company
pays for its 2019 full fiscal year renewal, whether or not the 2019 policies
remain in place for a full fiscal year or are terminated at the consummation
of the Merger (the " _Premium Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
amount necessary to procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Premium Cap,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase the most
advantageous policy available for an amount not to exceed the Premium Cap. At
the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time,
prepaid "tail policies" for a period of no more than six (6) years after the
Effective Time with coverage for the persons who are covered by the Companys
existing DandO and ERISA Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the
Companys existing DandO and ERISA Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time, in which event Parent shall cease to
have any obligations under the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _
6.3(c)_; _provided_ that the aggregate premium for such policies shall not
exceed the Premium Cap; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of
aggregate premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Premium Cap, the Company may procure and maintain for such six (6)
year period the most advantageous policies available for an aggregate premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In the event the Company elects to purchase such
"tail policies," the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail policies" in full force and
effect for a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time
and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns ( _i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to succeed to or assume the
applicable obligations of such Party set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall survive consummation
of the Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties and are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

 

Section 6.4 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter
for twelve (12) months or if shorter, the period of employment following the
Closing Date of the relevant Employee, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, each Employee
(excluding any Employees represented by labor unions and/or covered by the
Collective Bargaining Agreements) as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time who continues employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, following the Closing (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), with ( _i_ ) base salary or other base cash
compensation that are at least the same as, in the aggregate, the base salary
or other base cash compensation that were provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, ( _ii_ ) cash incentive compensation
opportunities (including short-term annual cash incentive compensation but
excluding equity or equity based-compensation) that are no less 

 



54

    

 favorable in the aggregate than the aggregate total cash incentive
compensation opportunities provided to the Continuing Employee (but excluding
equity or equity-based compensation opportunities) immediately prior to the
Effective Time, ( _iii_ ) severance and any other termination pay and benefits
plans, practices and policies that are no less favorable than such plans,
practices and policies that were applicable to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and ( _iv_ ) other employee benefits
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefits
that are then provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or
its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the
requirements of _Section_ __ _ 6.4(_ _d_ _)_ , ( _x_ ) Parent shall cause to
be maintained through December 31 of the year in which the Closing
Date occurs those annual (or other short-term) cash incentive award programs
covering the Continuing Employees substantially in the form as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and ( _y_ ) from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, honor the accrued and vested obligations of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under the Company
Plans. The compensation and benefits for Continuing Employees who are covered
by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be provided in accordance with the
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as amended, extended or terminated
from time to time in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall use reasonable best efforts to comply in all material respects with all
notice, consultation, effects bargaining or other bargaining obligations to
any labor union, labor organization, works council or group of employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company
agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in order to comply with such
obligations.

 

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit
accrual (but not for benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans or
post-retirement benefit plans) under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) in which Continuing Employees may
become eligible to participate in after the Closing (the " _New Benefit Plans_
"), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with the same amount of service
as was credited by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under
similar or comparable Company Plans in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation). In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to
the terms and conditions of the applicable New Benefit Plans, ( _i_ ) with
respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing, each Continuing Employee will
be eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without any waiting
time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces coverage
under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
was participating immediately before such commencement of participation and (
_ii_ ) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, for
the applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs, use reasonable best
efforts to ( _A_ ) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions
or

 



55

    

 requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or
comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time and ( _B_ ) subject to the terms and
conditions of the New Benefit Plans, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company
Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit Plan.

(d) Annual short-term cash bonuses earned in respect of 2018 or any other
year that is completed prior to the Closing Date shall be paid based on actual
performance (as determined and calculated in substantially the same manner as
with respect to prior performance periods, including adjustments consistent
with past practice) to any applicable employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who is employed on the payment date (or prorated based on actual
performance if, on or after July 1 of such year but before such payment date,
the applicable employee is terminated by the Company without Cause or resigns
for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Companys 2016 Incentive
Compensation Plan or an applicable employment agreement)) and payable promptly
following the finalization of the audited financial statements for the
applicable fiscal year or, if the Closing Date occurs before such date, no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date. Annual short-
term cash bonuses earned under the Tribune Media Company Executive Incentive
Plan or the Management Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _MIP_ ") in respect
of the year that the Closing Date occurs, if any, shall be paid to employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date (but in no event later than 10 Business Days following the
Closing Date), in amounts calculated on the basis of actual performance
through the Closing Date for the applicable performance period, determined and
calculated in substantially the same manner as with respect to prior
performance periods (including adjustments consistent with past practice),
prorated to reflect the portion of the performance period elapsed through the
Closing Date, except that the total of all such prorated payments shall not
exceed the total amount that would be payable under the MIP for such year if
the relevant performance criteria were achieved at 100%, and a bonus for the
remaining period of the year of the Closing Date, which may in Parents
discretion, be determined under the MIP or bonus plan of Parent that complies
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, shall be paid promptly following the
finalization of the audited financial statements of the Company for such year
based on actual performance (as determined in a similar manner) in accordance
with the Companys customary past practice. Furthermore, if the employment of
any such employee who is eligible for an annual short-term cash bonus under
the MIP in the year of Closing is terminated following the Closing by Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, without
Cause or by such employee with Good Reason (as such terms are defined in
the Companys 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan or an applicable employment
agreement) prior to the applicable payment date, the employee shall, following
execution and delivery of a customary release of claims, be paid a portion of
the employees annual short-term cash bonus for such year (without
duplication of amounts otherwise paid pursuant to the MIP, the Companys
severance guidelines, an individual employment or severance agreement with any
participating employee or otherwise), based on actual performance and
prorated to reflect the portion of such performance period that the terminated

 



56

    

 employee was employed by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, but no more than what would be payable if the relevant
performance criteria were achieved at 100%. Any other short-term bonuses in
respect of the year in which the Closing Date occurs paid pursuant to the
Company Plans set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (including comissions under sale incentive plans) earned through the
Closing Date (or, if earlier a termination without Cause or termination by the
employee with Good Reason) but not paid as of the Closing Date shall be paid
promptly following the Closing Date, prorated to reflect the portion of the
performance period elapsed through the Closing Date and without duplication of
amounts otherwise paid pursuant to the MIP, the Companys severance
guidelines, an individual employment or severance agreement with any
participating employee or otherwise. In all cases covered by this _Section_
__ _ 6.4(d)_, the Company shall accrue such bonuses on its financial
statements for each relevant period and shall make customary adjustments in
the amount of such accruals in accordance with GAAP.

(e) The terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ are included for the
sole benefit of the Parties and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon
any Continuing Employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any participant or beneficiary in any Company Plan or any other
Person or Governmental Authority (whether as a third-party beneficiary or
otherwise) other than the Parties hereto. Nothing contained in this _Section_
__ _ 6.4_ shall ( _i_ ) constitute or be deemed to constitute establishment
of or an amendment to or termination of any Company Plan or other
compensation or benefit plan, policy, program, Contract or arrangement, ( _ii_
) obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to retain the employment or service of (or provide any term or
condition of employment or service to) any particular Employee or other Person
or ( _iii_ ) prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) from amending, modifying or terminating any Company
Plan, Parent Plan, New Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan,
policy, program, Contract or arrangement, to the extent such amendment,
modification, or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable
plan, policy, program, Contract, or arrangement.

(f) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) days
after the date hereof, the Company will make available to Parent true and
correct copies of preliminary Section 280G calculations (based on the
assumptions set forth in the applicable calculations) with respect to
each "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code) who is reasonably likely to receive payments or benefits in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that possibly would not
be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station
Divestitures) (whether or not such approvals, consents, registrations,

consummation of the Merger pursuant to _Article VIII_ ); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, no party shall be required to pay (and, without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall pay or
agree to pay) any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party
(other than any filing fees paid or payable to any Governmental Authority)
for any approval, consent, registration, permit, authorization or other

this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parties agree and
acknowledge that, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_, receipt of
any such any approval, consent, registration, permit, authorization or other
confirmation is not a condition to Closing.

 

(b) To the extent mutually agreed by the Parties, the Company shall and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assign the options under option agreements

generality of the foregoing, the Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, cooperate in good faith with each other and
their respective Representatives and supply each other and their respective
Representatives with information, and enter into such agreements and

Sharing Station Acquisition is contingent upon the Closing.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall make, as promptly as reasonably practicable ( _i_ )

additional information and documentary material that may be

to cause the

 



58

    

 expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods regarding the
foregoing as soon as practicable. The Company and Parent shall each request
early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger, the
Station Divestitures and any Sharing Station Acquisitions, if applicable,
under the HSR Act. Parent shall pay 100% of the filing fees payable under the
HSR Act, irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated.

(d) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Order, each of Parent and the
Company shall ( _i_ ) cooperate and consult with each other in connection
with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any

to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a
reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings
and submissions, ( _ii_ ) promptly inform the other Party of (and if in

Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
under the HSR Act, the Communications Act and the FCC Rules; _provided_ that
Parent shall be entitled to direct, in consultation with the Company, and
approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) the content of, any
filings with or presentations or submissions to any Governmental Authority

the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably
necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any application for renewal of
any FCC License with respect to any Company Station and thereby to facilitate
the grant of the FCC Consent with respect to such Company Station, each of the
Company, Parent and their applicable Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter
into tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for
the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Company

their respective Subsidiaries) to enter into a tolling agreement.

 



59

    

(f) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within
the original effective periods of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall
have terminated this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company and
Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more
extensions of the effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation
of the transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, the Company
and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in
effect the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder.
No extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of the Company and
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.

 

(g) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall ( _i_ ) not
participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive

(including with respect to any of the actions referred to in  _Section_ __ _
7.1(a)_) without the other, ( _ii_ ) give the other reasonable prior notice of
any such meeting or conversation and ( _iii_ ) in the event one such Party is
prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental
Authority from participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any
such conversation, keep the non-participating Party reasonably apprised with
respect thereto.

 

(h) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(i)_, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to take actions to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
practicable, including ( _i_ ) the use of reasonable best efforts to avoid
the entry of, or the commencement of any Proceeding in any forum that could
result in, any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including ( _A_ ) the proffer and
agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect

or interests therein of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) (the actions referred to
in this _clause (A)_ , collectively, the " _Station Divestitures_ ") and ( _B_
) the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to take such other
actions, and promptly to effect such other actions (and the entry into
agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental
Authority giving effect thereto, including the entry into hold separate

_Approval_ _Action_ "), including, in the case of _clause_ _s (A)_ and _(_
_B_ _)_ , the Station Divestitures and Approval Actions listed on _Section_ __
_ 7.1(h)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, and ( _ii_ ) the use of
reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent or
preliminary Order is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to
be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Station Divestitures) in accordance with its terms unlawful or that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station
Divestitures), any and all steps (including the appeal thereof and the posting
of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened Order so as to
permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall
take the actions described in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



60

(i) require, or be construed to require the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any Station
Divestiture or Approval Action, unless such Station Divestiture or Approval
Action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger; or

Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries),
taken as a whole, as they would exist after giving effect to the Merger and
to the Station Divestitures and Approval Actions described on _Section_ __ _

efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC. Parent shall furnish all information concerning it as

Statement and ( _B_ ) shall promptly (and in no event later than the fifth
(5th) Business Day following the date of the Agreement) commence a "broker
search" in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act. 

(ii) All filings by the Company or Parent with the SEC in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and all mailings to the stockholders of
the Company in connection with the Merger shall be subject to the prior review
and comment by the other party, which comments the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall consider in good faith, acting reasonably. 

 



61

    

(iii) The Company shall ( _A_ ) as promptly as practicable notify Parent
of ( _1_ ) the receipt of any comments from the SEC and all other written
correspondence and oral communications with the SEC relating to the Proxy
Statement and ( _2_ ) any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplements
to the Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect thereto and
( _B_ ) supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between it or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger.

(iv) Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that none of
the information supplied by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the meeting of the
stockholders of the Company (the " _Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ ")
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

(v) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each
case, by the Company (with the reasonable assistance of Parent).

(b) The Company shall establish a record date and duly give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable
for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval and shall, subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, ( _i_ ) recommend to its stockholders the adoption
of this Agreement and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (
_ii_ ) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit such adoption and obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has
been called and noticed, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent other than ( _x_ ) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on the
adoption of this Agreement, or ( _y_ ) if, as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Company Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting;
_provided_  that in the case of either _clause (x)_ or _(y)_ , the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall only be adjourned or postponed for a minimum
period of time reasonable under the circumstances (it being understood that
any such adjournment or postponement shall not affect the Companys
obligation to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as aforesaid). The
Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance
with applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Companys obligations pursuant to this 

 



62

    

  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company
Acquisition Proposal or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _ 
Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_.

 

(c) Except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, (
_i_ ) the Company Board shall recommend that its stockholders vote in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting, ( _ii_
) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Company
Board has recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of
approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and ( _iii_ ) neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of
its board of directors that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.3 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ , and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, and shall not authorize or permit and use reasonable best efforts to
cause any of its officers, directors, employees or Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (
_ii_ ) participate or continue in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives) any nonpublic information relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries or afford access to its business, properties, assets,
books or records to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their
respective representatives), in connection with any inquiry, proposal or
offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Company Acquisition Proposal, ( _iii_ ) approve, endorse or recommend, or make
any public statement approving, endorsing or recommending, a Company
Acquisition Proposal or, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ _(e)_ , effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, ( _iv_ ) enter into any letter of
intent, merger agreement or other similar agreement providing for a Company
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
(each an " _Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), ( _v_ ) submit any
Company Acquisition Proposal to a vote of the stockholders of the Company or
( _vi_ ) authorize, commit, resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, prior to the time
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives a bona fide
written Company Acquisition Proposal, which has not resulted from a material
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, ( _i_ ) is or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Company Proposal and ( _ii_ ) failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company may, in response to such Company
Acquisition Proposal, furnish nonpublic information relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries

 



63

    

 to the Person or group (or any of their Representatives) making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Person or group and their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that ( _x_ ) prior to furnishing any nonpublic
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or
group or their respective Representatives, the Company enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group making such
Company Acquisition Proposal and ( _y_ ) promptly (but not more than one (1)
Business Day) after furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person,
the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such
nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its
Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys
Representatives may in any event inform a Person or group that has made or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making, a Company Acquisition
Proposal of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day) notify Parent in writing after receipt of any Company Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for
nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries by any
Person who has made or would reasonably be expected to make a Company
Acquisition Proposal and provide to Parent copies of all material
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries relating to such Company Acquisition Proposal or such
inquiry or proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person
making the proposal, request or offer, the material terms and conditions of
any such proposal, request or offer or the nature of the information requested
pursuant to such inquiry or request. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day), regarding any material changes to the status and material terms
of any such proposal, request or offer (including any material amendments
thereto or any material change to the scope or material terms or conditions
thereof), and provide to Parent copies of all material correspondence and
written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to such proposal, request or offer.

 

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and
shall direct its Representatives to, immediately ( _i_ ) cease any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, ( _ii_ ) terminate access for any Person (other than
Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) to any data room
and ( _iii_ ) request the return or destruction of any non-public information
provided to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives) in connection with a potential Company
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take
all actions reasonably necessary to enforce its rights under the provisions of
any "standstill" agreement between the Company and any Person (other than
Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives), and shall not
grant any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or modification to, any such
agreement, to permit such Person to submit a Company Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a
Person to orally request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation or
from granting such a waiver, in each case, to the extent the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



64

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to
the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case of a Company
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited after the date of this Agreement and
that did not result from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_ and
concurrently pay the fee required by _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ in order to enter
into a definitive agreement in connection with a Superior Company Proposal)
if: ( _i_ )( _A_ ) a Company Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company after
the date of this Agreement and such Company Acquisition Proposal is
not withdrawn prior to such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or ( _B_ )
there has been an Intervening Event; ( _ii_ ) in the case of a Company
Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Company
Proposal; and ( _iii_ ) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

 

(f) Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering
into any Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement, ( _i_ ) the Company Board
shall provide Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify, in reasonable
detail, the reasons therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such proposal, including a copy
of any proposed definitive agreement; ( _ii_ ) during the four (4) Business
Days following such written notice, the Company Board and its Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such Superior
Company Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable; and ( _iii_ ) at the
end of the four (4) Business Day period described in the foregoing _clause_ __
_ (ii)_, the Company Board shall have concluded in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and outside
financial advisors (and taking into account any legally binding (if accepted
by the Company) adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable ( _A_ ) the Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Company Proposal or ( _B_ )
the Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and, in each case, that failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws. After compliance with the foregoing sentence, the Company
shall have no further obligations under the foregoing sentence, and the
Company Board shall not be required to comply with such obligations with
respect to any other Superior Company Proposal or Intervening Event.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall prohibit the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(g)_ shall not permit the Company Board to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent otherwise permitted
by this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_. For the avoidance of doubt, any "stop, look and
listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself constitute a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



65

    

Section 7.4 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be a joint press release. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement
is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public statement relating to the Merger or this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless such Party
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall provide, on a
basis reasonable under the circumstances, an opportunity to the other Party to
review and comment on such press release or other announcement in advance,
and shall give reasonable consideration to all reasonable comments suggested
thereto. None of the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall
apply to any disclosure of any information ( _a_ ) in connection with
or following a Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and matters related thereto, ( _b_ ) in connection with any dispute
between the Parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or ( _c_ ) consistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Company in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

 

Section 7.5 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify and provide copies to the other of ( _a_ ) any material
written notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, ( _b_ ) any written notice or
other communication from any Governmental Authority or securities exchange in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, ( _c_ ) any Proceeding or investigation, commenced or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that would be
reasonably likely to ( _i_ ) prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or ( _ii_ )
result in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in _Article
VIII_ to be satisfied, or ( _d_ ) the occurrence of any event which would or
would be reasonably likely to ( _i_ ) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (
_ii_ ) result in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in
_Article VIII_ to be satisfied; _provided_ that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ shall not ( _x_ ) affect or be deemed to
modify any representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to
any obligation of any Party hereunder or ( _y_ ) update any section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter.

 

Section 7.6 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ , upon reasonable advance notice and subject to applicable Law,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent, its
Affiliates and its officers, agents, control persons, employees, consultants,
professional advisers (including attorneys, accountants and financial
advisors) (" _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business
hours, to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts,
commitments, records, officers and employees and, during such period the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish to Parent all

 



66

    

 other information concerning it, its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective businesses, properties and personnel (including for the purposes of
Parent obtaining an insurance policy relating to the Cubs Tax Dispute if
requested in connection therewith) as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided_ that the Company may restrict the foregoing access and the
disclosure of information to the extent that, in its good faith judgment, (
_i_ ) any Law applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries requires the
Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information, ( _ii_ ) the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, ( _iii_ ) disclosure of any
such information or document could result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege or ( _iv_ ) such access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.6(a)_, Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its Representatives to
comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which
agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 7.7 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Stock) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 7.8 _Stock Exchange  De-listing of Company Stock; Exchange Act
Deregistration_. Parent shall, with the reasonable cooperation of the Company,
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and
rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing by the Surviving
Corporation of the Class A Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the
Class A Stock and other securities of the Company under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.9 _Stockholder_ _Litigation_. Each Party shall promptly notify
the other Party in writing of any litigation related to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is
brought against such Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective
directors and shall keep the other Party informed on a reasonably current
basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall ( _a_ ) give
Parent the opportunity to participate, at its expense and subject to a
customary joint defense agreement, in the defense or settlement of any
such litigation, ( _b_ ) afford Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on filings and responses related thereto, which comments the Company
shall consider in good faith acting reasonably and ( _c_ ) keep Parent
apprised of, and consult with Parent with respect to, proposed strategy and
any significant decisions related thereto, and the Company shall not settle or
offer to settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_
that the Company may restrict the foregoing to the extent that, in its good
faith judgment, failure to do so could result in the loss of

 



67

    

 attorney-client privilege. Without limiting in any way the Parties
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, each of the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense or
settlement of any litigation contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_.

 

Section 7.10 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts ( _a_ ) to take all action necessary so that no
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby and ( _b_ ) if any such Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.11 _Company Warrants_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant shall be
assumed by Parent and the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the terms
of the Warrant Agreement, and each Company Warrant so assumed by Parent will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such
Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such
Company Warrant shall cease to represent a warrant to purchase Class A Stock
or Class B Stock and will be converted into a warrant (the " _Parent Warrant_
") exercisable for the Merger Consideration which the Class A Stock or Class
B Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of
the Merger.

 

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time and in
accordance with the Warrant Agreement, ( _i_ ) the Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Computershare Trust Company, N.A. the
officers certificate and opinion of counsel contemplated by Section 6.3 of
the Warrant Agreement and ( _ii_ ) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
execute and deliver to the Company an assumption agreement as necessary to

Section 7.12 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and
consummate the Financing or any Substitute Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions specified in the Commitment Letter (and, in any event, no later
than the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.2_), taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing
Period, including using its reasonable best efforts to ( _i_ )( _A_ )
maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and comply with all of their
respective covenants and obligations thereunder, ( _B_ ) negotiate and,
assuming all conditions to Closing set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ __ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ hereof have been satisfied, enter into and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing reflecting the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, so that such agreements are in
effect no later than the time at which the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and ( _C_ ) enforce their rights under the
Commitment Letter and ( _ii_ ) satisfy on a timely basis all the conditions
to the Financing and the

 



68

    

 definitive agreements related thereto that are in Parents (or its
Subsidiaries) control. In the event that all conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or
waived, and the Closing should otherwise occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2_, Parent and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Persons providing the Financing (the " _Debt Financing Parties_ ")
to fund the Financing at the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall, upon the request of the Company, keep the Company
informed on a current basis of the status of the Financing and material
developments with respect thereto and provide the Company promptly (and in no
event later than one (1) Business Day) with copies of any material definitive
agreements related to the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day) after
obtaining Knowledge thereof, give the Company written notice ( _i_ ) of any
breach or default by Parent, its Affiliates, any Debt Financing Party or any
other party to the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financing (or any event or circumstance, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would give rise to any breach or default), ( _ii_ ) of any
threatened or actual withdrawal, repudiation, expiration, intention not to
fund or termination of or relating to the Commitment Letter or the
Financing, ( _iii_ ) of any material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financing (other than ordinary course of business negotiations) or ( _iv_ ) if
for any reason Parent in good faith no longer believes it will be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing necessary to consummate the Merger.
Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the
Commitment Letter without the prior written approval of the Company;
_provided_ that Parent shall not, without the Companys prior written consent,
permit any such amendment, modification, assignment, termination or waiver to
be made to, or consent to or agree to any waiver of, any provision of or
remedy under the Commitment Letter which would ( _A_ ) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid
or original issue discount) other than any termination or reduction of the
commitments in respect of any bridge facility pursuant to the express terms of
the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof, ( _B_ ) impose new or
additional conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any of the conditions to the Financing or ( _C_ ) otherwise expand, amend,
modify or waive any provision of the Commitment Letter or the Financing in a
manner that in the case of this _clause (C)_ would reasonably be expected to
( _I_ ) delay, prevent or make less likely the consummation of the Merger or
the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) at the Effective Time, ( _II_ ) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Parties or any other
parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto or ( _III_ ) adversely affect the ability of Parent to
timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Commitment Letter may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified to add additional Financing Sources who are
not parties to the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. In the event that
new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with
any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Commitment
Letter permitted pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.12(b)_, such new
commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the "
Financing" and deemed to be the "Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly (and in any event no later than one (1)
Business Day) deliver to the Company true, correct and complete copies of any
termination, amendment, modification or replacement of the Commitment Letter.
If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter, or any portion
thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its

 



69

    

 Affiliates, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, to ( _x_ ) notify the Company in writing thereof, ( _y_ ) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute debt financing
sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including payment of the other Merger Amounts) in
accordance with the terms hereof (the " _Substitute Debt Financing_ ") on
terms and conditions that are not less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent
than the terms and conditions (taken as a whole) set forth in the Commitment
Letter and ( _z_ ) use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a
new financing commitment letter that provides for such Substitute Debt
Financing and, promptly after execution thereof (and, in any event, no later
than one (1) Business Day), deliver to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (redacted in a
similar manner as described in Section 4.9 hereof) and related definitive
financing documents with respect to such Substitute Debt Financing. Upon
obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute Debt Financing, such
financing shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and any commitment
letter for such Substitute Debt Financing shall be deemed the "Commitment
Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due
and payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Commitment Letter.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parents
nor Merger Subs obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon
Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Debt Financing or
any other financing.

 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best
efforts to, and to cause their Representatives to use reasonable best efforts
to, provide to Parent such customary cooperation as may be reasonably
requested by Parent to assist Parent in arranging the Financing, including
using reasonable best efforts in:

 

(i) assisting in preparation for and participation in (including causing
senior management of appropriate seniority and expertise to participate in),
upon reasonable advance notice and at reasonable times, a reasonable number of
meetings and calls (including customary one-on-one meetings with parties
acting as lead arrangers, bookrunners or agents for, and prospective lenders
of, the Financing), drafting sessions, rating agency presentations, road shows
and due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and
assisting Parent in obtaining ratings (but not any specific ratings) in
respect of Parent and public ratings in respect of any debt issued or incurred
as part of the Financing from Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC and
Moodys Investors Service, Inc.;

 

(ii) assisting Parent and its potential financing sources in the
preparation of ( _A_ ) customary bank information memoranda, customary
offering documents, lender presentations and other customary disclosure and

goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and subject to the prior
review by, and consent of, the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). In addition, the Company agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to supplement the written

 



72

    

 information (other than information of a general economic or industry
specific nature) concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries provided pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ to the extent that any such information, to the
Knowledge of the Company, contains any material misstatements of fact or omits
to state any material fact necessary to make such information concerning the

material respect as promptly as reasonably practicable after gaining Knowledge

(g) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, as soon as
promptly as practicable after receipt of any written request by Parent to do
so, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to:

(i) commence a consent solicitation to amend, eliminate or waive certain
sections of the Company Indenture as specified by Parent (a " _Consent
Solicitation_ "), with respect to all of the outstanding Company Notes on such
terms and conditions, including with respect to consent fees (such fees to be
paid by Parent), that are proposed by Parent; _provided_ __ that Parent shall
be responsible for the preparation of the Consent Solicitation Documents and
shall consult with the Company and afford the Company a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the necessary consent solicitation
statement, supplemental indenture and other related documents in connection
with such Consent Solicitation (the " _Consent Solicitation Documents_ ").
The Company shall provide and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its respective Representatives to provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the Consent Solicitation including appointing a
solicitation agent selected by Parent (with any compensation for such agent to
be paid by Parent). Promptly following the expiration of a Consent
Solicitation, assuming the requisite consent from the holders of the Company
Notes (including from persons holding proxies from such holders) has been
received and certified by the solicitation agent, the Company shall cause an
appropriate supplemental indenture (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") to
become effective providing for the amendments of the Company Indenture
contemplated in the Consent Solicitation Documents; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the fact that a Supplemental Indenture may become
effective earlier, the proposed amendments set forth therein shall not become
operative unless and until the Effective Time has occurred. The form and
substance of the Supplemental Indenture shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent;

 

(ii) commence an offer to purchase, including any "Change of Control Offer"
and/or any tender offer as specified by Parent, with respect to all of the
outstanding Company Notes, on such terms and conditions, including pricing
terms, that are proposed, from time to time, by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (" _Debt Tender Offer_ "), and Parent shall assist
the Company in connection therewith; _provided_ that Parent shall be
responsible for preparation of the Debt Tender Offer Documents and shall
consult with the Company and afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal,
supplemental indenture and other related documents in connection with such
Debt Tender Offer (the " _Debt Tender Offer Documents_ ") and the material
terms and conditions of the Debt Tender Offer. The terms and conditions
specified by Parent for the Debt Tender Offer shall be in compliance with the
Company Indenture, the Company Credit Agreement or any applicable Law. The
closing of a Debt Tender Offer, if any, shall be expressly conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender
Offer, the Company shall accept for purchase and purchase the Company Notes
properly 

 



73

    

 tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer ( _provided_
that the proposed amendments set forth in any Debt Tender Offer Document may
not become effective unless and until the Closing has occurred). The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its respective Representatives to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender
Offer, including appointing a dealer manager selected by Parent (with any
compensation to such dealer manager to be paid by Parent). The Debt Tender
Offer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 promulgated under the
Exchange Act (" _Rule 14e-1_"), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended
(the " _TIA_ "), if applicable, and any other applicable Law, it being
understood that the Company shall not be required to take any action that, in
the good faith judgment of the Company and after consultation with Company
counsel, does not comply with Rule 14e-1, the TIA, if applicable, or other
applicable Law;

(iii) deliver a notice to each holder of the Company Notes, in accordance
with Section 3.9(b) of the Company Indenture, with respect to a Change of
Control Offer (as defined in the Company Indenture) for the repurchase, on and
subject to the occurrence of a Change of Control Payment Date (as defined in
the Company Indenture), to be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, of
all of the Company Notes then outstanding and otherwise comply with the
Company Indenture with respect to such Change of Control Offer; and

(iv) ( _i_ ) deliver a notice of redemption pursuant to Section 5.3 of the
Company Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Company Indenture
(including Section 6 of the First Supplement thereto), which may be
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time; ( _ii_ ) cause the
delivery, taking or making of all required documents, actions or payments
(other than the deposit of the Company Notes Payoff Amount) under the Company
Indenture to effect the ( _A_ ) satisfaction and discharge of the Company
Indenture pursuant to _Article VIII_ thereof and ( _B_ ) release of all
obligations in respect of the Company Notes subject to the payment of the
Company Notes Payoff Amount; and ( _iii_ ) deliver to Parent a schedule
setting forth the Company Notes Payoff Amount.

of competent jurisdiction permanently prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger and such Order shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_

(ii) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its (
_A_ ) representations or warranties or ( _B_ ) covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, in each case which breach or failure to perform ( _x_
) would give rise to the failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ and ( _y_ ) is incapable
of being cured by the Company during the thirty (30) day period after written
notice from Parent of such breach or failure to perform, or, if capable of

the earlier of the end of such thirty (30) day period and the End Date;
_provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then
in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
such that the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

(d) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its ( _A_ ) representations or warranties or ( _B_ ) covenants or agreements

_x_ ) would give rise to the failure of a condition to the Merger set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and ( _y_ ) is
incapable of being cured by Parent and Merger Sub during the thirty (30) day
period after written notice from the Company of such breach or failure to
perform, or, if capable of being cured during such thirty (30) day period,
shall not have been cured by the earlier of the end of such thirty (30) day
period and the End Date; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_ if the
Company is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements such that Parent has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_; or

(ii) if at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval ( _A_ ) the Company Board authorizes the Company to enter into an
Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Company
Proposal to the extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, ( _B_ ) substantially concurrent with the
termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into an Alternative Company
Acquisition

 



77

    

 Agreement providing for a Superior Company Proposal and ( _C_ ) prior to or

forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination or the requirement
to make the payments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_. No termination of
this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 9.3 _Termination Fees; Expenses_.

 

(a) _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(i)_, or in the event that this Agreement is terminated
by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_, then, in each case,
the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, a fee in the amount of $135 million (the " _Company Termination Fee_
") at or prior to the termination of this Agreement in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_ or as promptly as
practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such
termination) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(c)(i)_.

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(iii)_, or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ in respect of a Willful Breach by
the Company of a covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and in
each case at any time after the date of this Agreement prior to such
termination ( _A_ ) a Company Acquisition Proposal has been made to the
Company and publicly announced or otherwise disclosed and has not been
withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement (or (I) prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting in the case of a termination pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(iii)_ or (II) prior to the applicable breach giving
rise to the termination right in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_) and ( _B_ ) within twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company ( _x_ ) enters into an agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal and such Company Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently consummated or ( _y_ ) consummates a Company Acquisition
Proposal, then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the Company Termination Fee, _less_
the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid by the Company,
concurrently with the consummation of such transaction arising from such
Company Acquisition Proposal (and in any event, within two (2)

 



78

    

 Business Days following such consummation); _provided_ , _however_ , that
for purposes of the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)(ii)_, references to "15%" and "85%" shall be replaced
by "50%".

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the documented out
of pocket costs and expenses, including any commitment fees under the
Commitment Letter and the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, Financing Sources, experts and consultants, incurred by
Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in an amount not to exceed $15,000,000 (the " _Parent
Expenses_ ") as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days following such termination).

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that ( _i_ ) the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, ( _ii_ ) the Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses are
not a penalty, but are liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and ( _iii_ ) that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for any amount
due pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, then the Company shall pay Parent
its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made (or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law). All payments under this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable. In no event shall a Company
Termination Fee be payable more than once.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, in the event that this Agreement is terminated
under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, the payment of the Company Termination Fee shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company
and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or Representatives
(the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

__ _ 9.1_, as the case may be. This _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ shall not limit any
covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Effective Time.

Section 10.2 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law,
this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all
respects by written agreement of the Parties at any time prior to the
Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; _provided_
that after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment that
requires further stockholder approval under applicable Law shall be made
without such required further approval. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ or an amendment or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ shall, in
order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company, action by their respective board of directors (or a committee
thereof), as applicable. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, this
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_, _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, _Section_ __ _ 10.8_, 
_Section_ __ _ 10.11(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.12(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.13_
and _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent
an amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision would
modify the substance of any such Section, and any related definitions insofar
as they affect such Sections) shall not be amended, waived or otherwise
modified in a manner that is adverse to the interests of any Financing Source
party to the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of such
Financing Source.

 

Section 10.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, Parent or Merger Sub on the one hand, or the
Company on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement of the other
Parties or (c) subject to the proviso of the first sentence of Section 10.2,
waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise
by any Party of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall act on behalf of Merger Sub
and the Company may rely on any notice given by Parent on behalf of Merger Sub
with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 10.3. Notwithstanding
anything set forth above, _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.8_, _Section_ __ _ 10.11(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.12(c)_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.13_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ (and any provision of this
Agreement to the extent a waiver of such provision would modify the substance
of any such Section) shall not be waived in a manner that is adverse to the
interests of any Financing Source party to the Commitment Letter without the
prior written consent of such Financing Source.

Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
Party incurring such cost or expense, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
in connection with the filing by the Parties of the FCC Applications.

 

Section 10.5 _Disclosure Letter References_. All capitalized terms not
defined in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter (as
applicable, the " _Disclosure Letter_ ") shall have the meanings assigned to
them in this Agreement. The Disclosure Letter shall, for all purposes in this
Agreement, be arranged in numbered and lettered parts and subparts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections contained
in this Agreement. Each item disclosed in the Disclosure Letter shall
constitute an exception to or, as applicable, disclosure for the purposes of,
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) to which it
makes express reference and shall also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth
for the purposes of every other part in the Disclosure Letter relating to
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) set forth in
this Agreement to the extent a cross-reference within the Disclosure Letter is
expressly made to such other part in the Disclosure Letter, as well as to the
extent that the relevance of such item as an exception to or, as applicable,
disclosure for purposes of, such other section of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure. The listing of any matter on the
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the
Company or Parent, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter
is material, is required to be disclosed by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds
or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in the
Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by the Company
or Parent, as applicable, of any Contract or Law shall be construed as
an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the
Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 10.6 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by
facsimile (with confirmation of transmission), by email (with confirmation of
receipt) or sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, such
as Federal Express, to the Parties at the following addresses (or at such
other address for a Party as shall be specified by like notice made pursuant

Section 10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, it being understood that each Party need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Signatures
delivered electronically or by facsimile shall be deemed to be original
signatures.

 

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement; No Third_ _-_ _Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the
instruments referred to herein), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement ( _a_ ) constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between Parent and the Company and among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof ( _provided_ that ( _x_ ) any
provisions of the Confidentiality 

 



82

    

 Agreement conflicting with this Agreement shall be superseded by this
Agreement and ( _y_ ) all standstill or similar provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and no longer be in effect upon
execution and delivery hereof) and ( _b_ ) are not intended to and do not
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
Effective Time, the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall be enforceable by
each Company Indemnified Party hereunder and his or her heirs and his or her
representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, the
Financing Sources shall be a third-party beneficiary of _Section_ __ _ 10.2_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_, this  _Section_ __ _ 10.8_, _Section_ __ _
10.11(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.12(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.13_ and _Section_ __
_ 10.14_.

 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so
long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby, taken as a whole, is not affected in a manner materially adverse to
any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 10.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such
consent shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.11 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing, the Commitment Letter, the performance
thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

 

Section 10.12 _Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the

 



83

    

 provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, including the obligations to consummate the
Merger, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the
federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware without
proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The Parties rights in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby
waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _
10.12_.

 

(b) In addition, each of the Parties ( _i_ ) consents to submit itself, and
hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any
state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, ( _ii_ ) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to
the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, ( _iii_ ) agrees
that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the
State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter
jurisdiction, and ( _iv_ ) consents to service of process being made through
the notice procedures set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 10.6_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the
Parties acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that any action or proceeding,
whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, against any
Financing Source arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Financing) shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York in the Borough of Manhattan (and the appellate courts thereof) and
each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action
or proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court and agrees not to
bring any such action or proceeding in any other court.

Section 10.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE).

 



84

    

Section 10.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and the
equityholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial
advisors, accountants, legal counsel, investment bankers, and other agents,
advisors and representatives of each of them) acknowledges and agrees that it
(and such other Persons) shall have no recourse against the Financing Sources,
and the Financing Sources shall be subject to no liability or claims by the
Company (or such other Persons) in connection with the Financing or in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Subject to the rights of Parent under the Commitment Letter under the terms
thereof, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent agrees on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates that the Financing Sources shall not have
any liability or obligation to Parent or any of its Affiliates (whether under
contract or tort, in equity or otherwise) relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated herein (including the Financing).

OF 

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY

 

 _FIRST_ : The name of the Corporation is Tribune Media Company (the "
_Corporation_ ").

 

 _SECOND_ : The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware
is located at 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, in the City of Wilmington,
County of New Castle, 19808. The name of its registered agent at such address
is Corporation Service Company.

 

 _THIRD_ : The nature of the business or purpose to be conducted or promoted
by the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (" _DGCL_ ").

 

 _FOURTH_ : The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is [●] shares of Common Stock, par value $[●] per
share.

_FIFTH_ : The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for the
purpose of creating, defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the
Corporation and its directors and stockholders:

 

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed and may be
altered from time to time in the manner provided in the By-Laws, and
vacancies in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of
Directors_ ") and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in
the authorized number of directors may be filled, and directors may be
removed, as provided in the By-Laws.

 

(b) The election of directors may be conducted in any manner approved by
the stockholders at the time when the election is held and need not be by
written ballot.

(c) All corporate powers and authority of the Corporation (except as at
the time otherwise provided by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by
the By-Laws) shall be vested in and exercised by the Board of Directors.

 

(d) The Board of Directors shall have the power without the assent or vote
of the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws of the

Incorporation otherwise provide.

provision.

 

 _SIXTH_ : Subject _Section_ __ _ 5(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7_, the
Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in
this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by
the laws of the State of Delaware, and all rights herein conferred upon
stockholders or directors are granted subject to this reservation.

_SEVENTH_ :

 

(a) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended,
any person (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact
that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while
a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, manager, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust, enterprise, nonprofit entity or other entity of any type,
including service with respect to any employee benefit plan, whether the basis
of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or
officer or in any other capacity while serving, at the request of the
Corporation, as a director, officer, trustee, manager, employee or agent,
against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys
fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in such
Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise
provided in _Section_ __ _ 7(c)_, the Corporation shall be required to
indemnify an Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part
thereof) commenced by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person only if the
commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Indemnified Person
was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors. The Corporation hereby
agrees: ( _i_ ) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., in the event
any Indemnified Person has the right to receive indemnification from one or
more sponsors, affiliates or third parties, the Corporations obligations to
such Indemnified

 



2

    

 Person are primary); ( _ii_ ) that it shall be required to pay the full
amount of expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any Proceeding in
advance of its final disposition as required by the terms of this Certificate
of Incorporation, without regard to ( _A_ ) any rights such Indemnified Person
may have, or the exercise of any such rights by such Indemnified Person,
against any other sponsors, affiliates or third parties or ( _B_ ) any advance
or payment made by such sponsors, affiliates or third parties on behalf of
such Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified
Person is entitled to indemnification from the Corporation; and ( _iii_ ) that
it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases such sponsors or affiliates
from any and all claims against such sponsors or affiliates for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof.

(b) The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by an Indemnified Person in connection with
any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all amounts advanced if it
should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled
to be indemnified under this _Section_ __ _ 7_ or otherwise.

 

(c) If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7_ is not paid in full within thirty (30) days after a written
claim therefor by the Indemnified Person has been received by the Corporation
(and any undertaking required under  _Section_ __ _ 7(b)_), the Indemnified
Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim. If successful
in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation
to recover an advancement of expenses, the Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such claim. In any
such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the
Indemnified Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or
advancement of expenses under applicable law.

(d) The Corporation may indemnify and advance expenses to any person who
was or is made or is threatened to be made or is otherwise involved in any
Proceeding by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such
person is the legal representative, is or was an employee or agent of the
Corporation or, while an employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee,
manager, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise, nonprofit entity or
other entity of any type, including service with respect to any employee
benefit plan, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including
attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
Proceeding. The ultimate determination of entitlement to indemnification of
persons who are non-director or non-officer employees or agents shall be made
in such manner as is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole
discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Corporation shall not
be required to indemnify a person described therein in connection with a
Proceeding initiated by or on behalf of such person if the Proceeding was not
authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

 



3

    

(e) The Corporation may pay the expenses (including attorneys fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by an employee or agent in defending any
Proceeding in advance of its final disposition on such terms and conditions as
may be determined by the Board of Directors.

 

(f) The rights conferred on any person by this _Section_ __ _ 7_ shall not
be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have under the
certificate of incorporation of the Corporation prior to the effectiveness of
this Certificate of Incorporation or have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

(g) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7(a)_, the Corporations
obligation under the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7_, if any, to
indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director,
officer, trustee, manager, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise,
nonprofit entity or other entity of any type, including service with respect
to any employee benefit plan, shall be reduced by any amount such person
collects as indemnification from such other corporation or such partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise, nonprofit entity
or other entity of any type; _provided_ that no Indemnified Person shall have
the obligation to reduce, offset, allocate, pursue or apportion any
indemnification advancement, contribution or insurance coverage among multiple
parties possessing such duties to such Indemnified Person prior to the
Corporations satisfaction of its obligations under the provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7_.

(h) The Board of Directors may, to the full extent permitted by law as it
presently exists, or may hereafter be amended from time to time, authorize an
appropriate officer or officers to purchase and maintain, at the Corporations
expense, insurance: ( _i_ ) to indemnify the Corporation for any obligation
which it incurs as a result of the indemnification of directors, officers,
employees and agents under the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7_; and (
_ii_ ) to indemnify or insure directors, officers, employees and agents
against liability in instances in which they may not otherwise be indemnified
by the Corporation under the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7_.

 

(i) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 8_, or adoption of any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation inconsistent with this _Section_ __ _ 7_, shall not adversely
affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act
or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal, modification or
adoption of any inconsistent provision. The rights provided hereunder shall
inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and such persons heirs,
executors and administrators.
