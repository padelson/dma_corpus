wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has (i) unanimously determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and its shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company;

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has approved the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and adopted this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein
in connection with this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows: ARTICLE I.

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the " _OGCL_ "),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
its existence under Ohio law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the third business
day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and
time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
and Merger Sub shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in
accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the
relevant provisions of the OGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio or at such other,
later date and time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the OGCL
(such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the OGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as
provided under the OGCL.

 

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to _Section 5.9_ , the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable Law (except as to the name of the Surviving Corporation, which
shall be RTI International Metals, Inc.).

(b) At the Effective Time, subject to _Section 5.9_ , the code of regulations
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law (except as to the
name of the Surviving Corporation, which shall be RTI International Metals,
Inc.).

 



\- 2 - Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. For avoidance of
doubt, it is the intention of the parties hereto and the Company Board of
Directors that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time who become directors of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
_Section 1.6_ (the " _Merger Sub Directors_ ") shall be deemed "Continuing
Directors" as such term is defined in and for all purposes under the
Convertible Notes Indenture (as defined below), and the execution and delivery
of this Agreement shall be deemed conclusive evidence that the election of
the Merger Sub Directors as directors of the Surviving Corporation has been
unanimously approved by the Company Board of Directors as of the Effective
Time.

 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II. __

 

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares or
securities of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Shares_. Each share of common stock of
Merger Sub, no par value, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter remain outstanding and represent one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and those shares of the Surviving Corporation shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the other provisions of
this _Article II_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Cancelled Shares,
shall at the Effective Time be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive 

 



\- 3 -  2.8315 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and together
with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as specified
below, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All of the shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this _Article II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
" _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ , as well as any dividends or other
distributions to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in
accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_.

 

(b) _Dissenting Shares_. No right to fair value or appraisal or similar rights
shall be available to holders of Company Common Stock with respect to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_ ), the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Exchange Ratio
shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect
such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
with respect to Book-Entry Shares or otherwise, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares
evidenced by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder)
shall receive from the Exchange Agent, in lieu thereof and upon surrender
thereof, a cash payment (without interest) in an amount representing such
holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent on behalf of all such holders of Parent Common Stock that would
otherwise be issued.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued and delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
2.4(a)_ representing the Merger Consideration over (B) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to former holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (such excess, the " _Parent
Excess Shares_ "). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, on
behalf of former holders of Company Common 

 



\- 4 -  Stock, sell the Parent Excess Shares at the then-prevailing prices on the
NYSE. The sale of the Parent Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall
be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to complete the sale of the Parent Excess
Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as is practicable, consistent
with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market
conditions. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed
to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such
proceeds in trust for holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Parent Shares
Trust_ "). The amount of all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-
pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the
Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of Parent Excess Shares
shall be paid by the Company. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion
of the Parent Shares Trust to which each former holder of Company Common
Stock is entitled, if any, by multiplying that amount of the aggregate net
proceeds composing the Parent Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such former
holder of Company Common Stock is entitled (after taking into account all
shares of Parent Common Stock held as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all former holders of Company Common
Stock are entitled.

(ii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing Company Common Stock with respect to any fractional share
interest, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Company Convertible Notes_. The Companys 3.000%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (the " _2015 Convertible Notes_ ") issued
pursuant to the indenture, dated as of December 14, 2010 (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Convertible Notes Indenture_ "),
between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as
trustee, and the Companys 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the "
_2019 Convertible Notes_ " and together with the 2015 Convertible Notes, the
" _Company Convertible Notes_ ") issued pursuant to the Convertible Notes
Indenture, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain issued and outstanding unless converted prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture, and shall be
treated in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture
following the Effective Time; provided, however, that any Company Convertible
Notes that are owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be transferred to the Surviving Corporation and shall be
cancelled and retired by the Surviving Corporation, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

Section 2.3 _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of
the Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement (the " _Exchange
Agent Agreement_ ") relating to the Exchange Agents responsibilities, with
respect thereto in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(which confirmation of satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



\- 5 - Section 2.4 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates
representing such Parent Common Stock, at Parents election) representing the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate
Merger Consideration (such shares, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within ten (10) business days of the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree upon prior to the Effective Time) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_.

 

(c) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with either
a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any
dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company
Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee
if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4(c), each Certificate
and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with
any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_.

Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ until such holder shall
surrender such share in accordance with this _Section 2.4_. After the
surrender in accordance with this _Section 2.4_ of a share of Company Common
Stock to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_ , the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to
the Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to this _Article II_
) any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to the share of Parent
Common Stock represented by such share of Company Common Stock.

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company other than the right
to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_ (together with any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_ ), without interest, and (ii) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_ ,
and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such
losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange
Fund. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent, upon demand.

(g)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates

 



\- 7 -  or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any
dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_ without any interest thereon. 

(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or
the cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the
second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section
2.4(g)_ , Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and
distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

converted into an option to purchase, on the same terms and conditions
(including with respect to vesting) as were applicable to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an " _Adjusted Option_

is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
PSA_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, (i) if granted in 2013, vest

the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to the Company PSA
immediately prior to the Effective Time are deemed achieved at the maximum
target performance percentage and otherwise shall vest in accordance with the
terms of such Company PSA) and be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) with respect to each
share of Company Common Stock underlying the award on the terms generally
applicable to issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (ii)
if granted in 2014 or 2015, be converted into a performance share award (which
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSA that
shall be converted hereunder has been determined assuming achievement of (x)
for Company PSAs granted in calendar year 2014, the maximum target performance
percentage, and (y) for Company PSAs granted in calendar year 2015, 125% of
target performance, in each case as specified in the applicable Company Stock
Plan award agreement) (each, an " _Adjusted PSA_ "), in respect of the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares, determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company PSA immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted PSAs shall otherwise continue to vest over
time in accordance with its terms (but which for the avoidance of doubt shall
no longer be subject to any further performance-based vesting or other
provisions, but shall be subject to the vesting provisions of Section
21(c)(iii)(A) of the Companys 2014 Stock and Incentive Plan) and otherwise
will be settled in shares of Parent Common Stock upon any vesting of the
Adjusted PSAs.

share of Company Common Stock underlying the award on the terms generally
applicable to issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

(d) Each unvested restricted share unit award granted under a Company Stock

of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares, determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU by the Exchange Ratio.

progress (each, an " _Offering Period_ ") under the Companys Employee Stock

Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of such time,

Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any

the 

 



\- 14 -  requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley

Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item

or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and

 



\- 15 -  forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2014, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. The Company has disclosed to Parent (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that

threatened), nor do any circumstances exist that could be reasonably expected
adversely to affect such qualification. No trust funding any Company Benefit
Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9).

of the United States (i) have been maintained in accordance with all

intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions, except,

reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code: (i) the
Company Benefit Plans satisfy all minimum funding requirements under Sections

such report is complete and accurate in all material respects; (iv) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the

the case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (vii), the occurrence or non-

(g) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, maintained,
established, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any plan that
is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a
" _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning
of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "), and none of Company
and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan as
a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan or

(h) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the Companys knowledge, no set of circumstances exists
which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Company,
the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to the Company Benefits Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under
any of the Company Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates or any Company Benefit Plan to the PBGC, the
Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan,
any Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or any
other party.

 



\- 19 - (i) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates has been involved in any transaction that would reasonably be
expected to cause the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, after the Effective
Time, Parent or any of its Affiliates to be subject to material liability
under Section 4069 of ERISA. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred (either directly or indirectly,
including as a result of any indemnification obligation) any material
liability under or pursuant to Title I of ERISA or the penalty, excise Tax or
joint and several liability provisions of the Code relating to employee
benefit plans, and no event, transaction or condition has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to result in any such liability to the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, any of their ERISA Affiliates or, after the Effective Time,
Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, has sponsored or has any
obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any
post-employment or post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

(k) Each Company Benefit Plan that is or was a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (a " _Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") has been operated in all material respects
between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 in good faith compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder and since January
1, 2009 has been in all material respects in documentary and operational
compliance with Section 409A of the Code. No assets set aside for the payment
of benefits under any Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan are held outside
of the United States, except to the extent that substantially all of the
services to which such benefits are attributable have been performed in the
jurisdiction in which such assets are held, and otherwise no arrangement
exists with respect to a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan that would
result in income inclusion under Section 409A(b) of the Code. The Company is
not party to, or otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement that provides for the gross-up of taxes imposed by Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

 

(l) (i) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, either alone or in combination with another event (x) entitle any
current or former employee, director, consultant or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or accrued
pension benefit or any other payment, (y) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee,
director, consultant or officer or (z) trigger any funding obligation under
any Company Benefit Plan or related trust or funding vehicle, or impose any
restrictions or limitations on the Companys rights to administer, amend or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan. (ii) No Company Benefit Plan provides for
the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code
or otherwise. (iii) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in combination with another
event, by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or
termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or Company Benefit Plan
currently in effect would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment"
(as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 

(m) No material deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms of any
Company Benefit Plan has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance under
Section 162(m) of the Code.

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the SEC since January 1, 2012 (all such documents and
reports filed or furnished by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Parent
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Parent SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of Parents Subsidiaries is, or at any time since January
1, 2012 has been, required to file any forms, reports or other documents with
the SEC.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (i) fairly present

therein or in the notes thereto), (iii) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Parent and its consolidated

transaction or relationship between or among Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), in each case where the result, purpose
or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in

Section 4.4 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2014, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Based on and with respect to its most recent
evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the
date hereof, management of Parent has disclosed to Parents auditors and the
audit committee of the Parent Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect Parents ability to report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness
and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the Company
prior to the date hereof.

obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued, absolute,
determined or contingent, except for (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed

financing, operating, environmental and other data and information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Parent may reasonably request, including,
without limitation, retaining on mutually acceptable terms, at the request of
(and sole cost of) Parent Mandiant Corporation to conduct a cyber review of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries IT systems. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not be required to afford such access if it would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, would
cause a violation of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would constitute a violation of any
applicable Law or would involve any invasive, destructive or subsurface
sampling, testing or investigation of any properties or facilities.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of December 21, 2014, between the Company and Parent (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



\- 45 - Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_ , the Company shall,
shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors and employees to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
agents, financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives (collectively " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or
any of its Affiliates to: (A) immediately cease any ongoing solicitation,
knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any persons that may
be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and promptly instruct (to the
extent it has contractual authority to do so and has not already done so prior
to the date of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any person that has
executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement within the 24-month
period prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with any actual or
potential Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all such information or
documents or material incorporating confidential information in the
possession of such person or its Representatives and (B) until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VII_, not, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
any non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Takeover Proposal, (2) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any
non-public information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, a Takeover Proposal (other than, solely in response to an
unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this _Section 5.3_ and
to limit its conversation or other communication exclusively to such
referral), or (3) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to
approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document,
agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle (whether written or oral,
binding or nonbinding) with respect to a Takeover Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "). Except to the extent necessary to take any actions
that the Company or any third party would otherwise be permitted to take
pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ (and in such case only in accordance with the
terms hereof), (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not release any
third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
permission under, (1) any standstill provision in any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (2) any confidentiality
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party other than, with respect to this clause (2), any waiver, amendment,
modification or permission under a confidentiality provision that does not,
and would not be reasonably likely to, facilitate, encourage or relate in any
way to a Takeover Proposal or a potential Takeover Proposal and (B) the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to enforce the confidentiality and standstill
provisions of any such agreement, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, immediately take all steps within their power necessary
to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any person
other than Parent or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such provisions;
_provided_ that the Company shall be permitted not to enforce any standstill
or similar provision of any agreement if (i) the counterparty to such
agreement has approached the Company on an unsolicited basis with a Takeover
Proposal other than in connection with or as a result of a breach of this
_Section 5.3_ by the Company, its Affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives and (ii) the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to
be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



\- 46 - (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_
, if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company, directly or
indirectly receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Takeover Proposal from
any person that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the
Company, its Affiliates and the Companys and its Affiliates Representatives
and if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, directly or indirectly, (A)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the person that has made such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives and potential sources of funding; _provided_ , that the
Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided or made available to Parent and (B) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal
(including, as a part thereof, making counterproposals). " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than those
applicable to Parent that are contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(including standstill restrictions), provided that such confidentiality
agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the
provisions of this _Section 5.3_.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after
receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Parent after receipt by the Company
or any of its Representatives of any Takeover Proposal, including of the
identity of the person making the Takeover Proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof, and shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours
after receipt) provide copies to Parent of any written proposals, indications
of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, as to the
status of (including changes to any material terms of, and any other material
developments with respect to) such Takeover Proposal (including by promptly
(and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies
of any additional or revised written proposals, indications of interest,
and/or draft agreements relating to such Takeover Proposal). The Company
agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any
person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company
from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section
5.3_.

 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(d)_ and, with respect
to (i)(A) and (i)(B) of this Section only, Section 5.3(e), the Company Board
of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold,

 



\- 47 -  withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other
than a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) (it being understood that the Company Board of Directors may
refrain from taking a position with respect to such a tender offer or exchange
offer until the close of business as of the tenth business day after the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act without such action being considered an Adverse
Recommendation Change) or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to adopt, approve or recommend to shareholders of the Company a Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with _Section 5.3(b)_ ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company Shareholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board of Directors may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or, if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(h)_ if after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited written
Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 5.3, the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) such
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) in light of such
Takeover Proposal, the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely
to be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making such Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four (4) business days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and
has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Superior Proposal, a
copy of any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement with the person making
such Superior Proposal and a copy of any financing commitments relating
thereto (or, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of
the material terms thereof), (B) the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause
such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (C)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall
have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (D)
in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the form,
amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A)
above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso
shall commence (except that the four (4) business day period notice period
referred to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the
longer of (x) two (2) business days and (y) the period remaining under the
notice period under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the
delivery of such additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time
the

 



\- 48 -  Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section
5.3(d)_ anew with respect to such additional notice pursuant to clauses (A)
through (D) above of this proviso; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
_Section 5.3_.

 

(e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject
to _Section 5.3(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 5.3(e)_),
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board of
Directors from making an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change would be a violation of the Company Board
of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has
given Parent at least four (4) business days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify the reasons
therefor, (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives
to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period after giving
any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would not
permit the Company Board of Directors to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this  _Section 5.3(e)_, (C) following the end of such notice
period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined, after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event would be a violation of the
Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (D) in
the event of any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to
such Intervening Event, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A)
above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso
shall commence (except that the four (4) business day notice period referred
to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer
of (1) two business days and (2) the period remaining under the notice period
under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (D)), during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice pursuant to clauses (A) through (D)
above of this proviso.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the shareholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the shareholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the
determination in good faith of the Company Board of Directors, after
consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would reasonably
be likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under applicable Law
or obligations under applicable federal securities Law of the Company Board of
Directors; _provided_ , that any such position or disclosure (other than any
"stop, look and listen" communication) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board of Directors expressly and
concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

 



\- 49 - Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Form S-4, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the Companys shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent, to keep the Form S-4 effective through the Closing in order to permit
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance and
reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of
Company Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the others
prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon. Parent or the Company, as applicable, will advise
the other promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when
the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has
been filed, the threat or issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or
written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information, and will promptly provide the other with copies
of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent
or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include a
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company. At the Companys request, Parent shall cooperate in appropriately
amending or supplementing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to reflect any
Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with this Agreement.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to
duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the "
_Company Shareholders  Meeting_") and not postpone or adjourn the Company

 



\- 50 -  Shareholders Meeting except to the extent required by applicable Law or to
solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement if
sufficient votes to constitute the Company Shareholder Approval have not been
obtained; _provided_ , that, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the
Company, the Company Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than 20 days after the date for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law). The Company will, except in the
case of an Adverse Recommendation Change (i) through the Company Board of
Directors, recommend that its shareholders adopt this Agreement and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.5(c)_ , effective as of the
Effective Time and for a period of one year thereafter, Parent shall provide,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") for so long as the applicable
Company Employee remains employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits paid and provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that for purposes of the foregoing sentence the
compensation and employee benefit plans generally provided to employees of
the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including without
limitation continued payment of Annual Bonuses as provided in Section 5.5(e)
below) shall be deemed to be substantially comparable, on an aggregate basis,
to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of this sentence, it being understood that the
Company Employees may commence participation in Parents compensation and
benefit plans on different dates following the Effective Time with respect to
different such plans.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the Company
Employees become eligible to participate following the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each
Company Employee with the Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual rates or contribution rates under
such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the same extent such service
was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such
recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any defined
benefit retirement plan or plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii)
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Company Employee with respect to the
same period of service, (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical,
dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Company
Employee first participates (the first date of such participation, the "
_Participation Date_ "), Parent

 



\- 51 -  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be
waived with respect to such Company Employee to the extent such limitation
would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Participation
Date, and (B) if the Participation Date does not occur on the first day of a
calendar year, credit each Company Employee for an amount equal to any
medical, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Company Employee in the
year in which the Participation Date occurs for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited
under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Participation Date. Such credited expenses shall
also count toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or
similar limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
following the Effective Time, while employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the Company Employees whose employment is governed by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be provided compensation and benefits
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as
in effect from time to time.

(d) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
thirty (30) business days before the Closing Date, the Company Board of
Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Companys
401(k) plans (the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "), effective as of the day prior
to the Closing Date. Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable
following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on
the termination of the Company 401(k) Plans, the assets thereof shall be
distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Parents 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the
Company Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans), in the form of cash, in
an amount equal to the full account balance (including any promissory notes)
distributed to such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plans to the
Parent 401(k) Plan; provided that this sentence shall not apply with respect
to those accounts designated as "Roth" accounts under the Company 401(k)
Plans.

(e) Notwithstanding anything set forth in any Company Benefit Plan or this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall pay to Bonus-Eligible Employees
(as defined below), at the end of each fiscal quarter occurring during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, such portion
of their respective Annual Bonuses (as defined below) (based on the
achievement of applicable quarterly performance targets through the end of
each such quarter as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Annual Bonus Plan (as defined below)) as shall have been accrued by the
Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in
its financial statements, based on the achievement of such applicable
quarterly performance targets, in respect of the Companys fiscal year in
which the Effective Time occurs. In addition, following the Closing Date,
until such time as Bonus-Eligible Employees become eligible to earn annual
bonuses pursuant to an applicable Post-Closing Plan, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to pay

 



\- 52 -  such portions of the Annual Bonuses as shall have accrued, with such accrual
and payment to be made in the same manner as provided in the preceding
sentence. For purposes of this Section 5.5(e), the term (i) " _Bonus-Eligible
Employee_ ", shall mean any Company Employee who would have been eligible to
receive payment of an Annual Bonus under the Annual Bonus Plan, who also
remains employed through each applicable quarterly payment date referenced
above and (ii) " _Annual Bonus_ " shall mean the annual bonus in respect of a
given fiscal year that otherwise could have been payable at the end of the
applicable fiscal year, subject to achievement of applicable annual
performance targets, pursuant to the applicable annual bonus Company Benefit
Plans (identified in Section 5.5(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) (the "
_Annual Bonus Plans_ ").

 

(f) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor all accrued and vested benefits under the
Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time and applicable Law as such agreements and
arrangements may be modified or terminated in accordance with their terms from
time to time.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries)
or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date,
Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 5.5_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Company Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and any applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger, (ii)
the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) taking
reasonable actions to obtain (and cooperating with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall
include furnishing all information and documentary material required under the
HSR Act or other Competition Laws) required to be obtained or made in
connection with the

 



\- 53 -  Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement (provided
that the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that no consent,
authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party,
shall be a condition to the parties obligations to effect the Merger except
as explicitly contemplated by _Article VI_ ), and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take any action
after the date of this Agreement that, at the time it is taken and to the
knowledge of such party, would reasonably be expected to materially delay the
obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent
from any such Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to Closing
or materially delay the fulfillment of, or result in not fulfilling, all
conditions precedent to the Merger. To the extent that transfers of any
permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as a result of the
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, the parties
hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in no event shall Parent or the Company be required to sell, divest, dispose
of, hold separate or otherwise agree to limit its freedom of action (each, a "
_Divestiture Action_ ") with respect to any assets, properties or businesses
(including those assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it under
this Agreement). Neither party shall, without the written consent of the other
party, publicly or before any Governmental Entity or other third party,
offer, suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall not commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any Divestiture Action.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.6_. In that regard, prior to
the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this
Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to
(and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their
counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.
Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of (or, in
the case of oral communications, advise the other party orally of) any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and permit
the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed communication

and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of
the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation,
certificate of incorporation, code of regulations and bylaws or similar
organizational documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving Corporations
organizational documents in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time

of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such claim.

fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless

trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking consistent with the Company Organizational
Documents to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission by them in
their capacities as such occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before
or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with
such Indemnified Party serving as an officer, director, employee or other
fiduciary of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit
of the Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action.

 



\- 56 - (c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage in effect as of the date
hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than
the existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage with respect to matters existing or arising on
or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not
be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") required to be obtained pursuant hereto,
but in such case shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage possible that does not exceed the Maximum Amount in cost.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Parent so elects, the
Company shall purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were
committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Parties in
their capacity as such; _provided_ that such "tail policy" shall provide
coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other
terms not less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage in
effect as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided
further in no event shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by the
Company, exceed the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased,
Parent shall have no further obligations under this _Section 5.9(c)_. The
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 5.9_.

indemnification arrangement, the OGCL or otherwise.

 

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so
as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their successors,
heirs and legal representatives) to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies without
the consent of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed
that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to
the contrary, (i) the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_ , and (ii) this
_Section 5.9_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall be
enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs
and legal representatives against Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
their respective successors and assigns.

 



\- 57 - (g) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the

Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of

(a) The Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in
the Companys defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the
Company and/or its directors or executive officers relating to the

implement such other techniques if doing so would reasonably permit the
disclosure of privileged information without jeopardizing such privilege. The
Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation
commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or
its directors, executive officers or similar persons by any shareholder of the

provided in _Section 7.3_ , liability pursuant to the Confidentiality

\- 64 -  equity, including liability for damages, determined taking into account all
relevant factors including the loss of the benefit of the Merger to the

premium).

Section 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_
, (ii) by the Company pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)_ and, at the time of such
termination, (A) the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained
and (B) Parent would have been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(g)_ , (iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, or
(iv) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_
or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ , and in the case of any
termination pursuant to this clause (iv), (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have
been publicly announced or shall have become publicly known and (B) at any
time on or prior to the twelve-month anniversary of such termination the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or the transactions contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal are consummated, the Company shall pay Parent the
Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in
immediately available funds (1) in the case of clause (i), within two business
days of such termination, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) prior to or
concurrently with such termination, and in the case of clause (iv) upon the
earlier of entering into such definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover
Proposal or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by a Takeover
Proposal. " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to
$50,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
the Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this
_Section 7.3(a)_ , from and after such termination and payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3(a)_ ,
the Company shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other
than as provided under this  _Section 7.3(a)_ , except in the case of fraud
or intentional and material breach by the Company of this Agreement. Each of
the parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not intended to be
a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is due
and payable and which do not involve fraud or intentional and material breach,
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall Parent be entitled to more than one payment of the Termination Fee.
Solely for purposes of this _Section 7.3_ , "Takeover Proposal" shall have the
meaning ascribed thereto in  _Section 8.15(xxv)_, except that all references
to 15% shall be changed to 50%.

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ , then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent
for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related Actions commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay
to Parent interest on such amount from and including 

 



\- 65 -  the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual
payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made.

\- 68 -  any of the other details specified in this paragraph; _provided_ , _however_
, that such notification shall only be effective on the date specified in such

the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Merger Sub and Parent

Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is

be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

the Company, Parent and Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
receipt of Company Shareholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall
by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE
require further approval of the shareholders of the Company, the effectiveness
of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the
shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by any party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this

the Company agrees that (a) their respective representations, warranties,

the provisions of _Section 5.9_ , this Agreement is not intended to, and does
not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto
in accordance with _Section 8.11_ without notice or liability to any other
person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date hereof or
as of any other date.

an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
