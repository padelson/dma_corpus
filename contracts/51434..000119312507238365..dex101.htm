by such party with any Governmental Entity related to this Agreement or
the Transaction, provided that with respect to all such filings,
presentations or submissions, no party need supply another (or its counsel)
with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the extent that
any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to
such party may require such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
access to any such properties or information; and

(iv) use all best endeavours to resolve such objections, if any, as may be

liability company ( _GmbH_ ) ("LLC") in accordance with the terms of the
Shareholders Agreement and articles 53 ss. of the Swiss Merger Act of October
3, 2003 (as amended), so as to take into account the corporate structure of

reflecting the terms of the Agreed Documents, including such obligations
which are included in the Shareholders Agreement and in other Agreed Documents
but which (for lack of legal feasibility within the framework of the law of
stock corporations or for other reasons) are not included in the articles
of association of JVCo as a stock corporation. For the avoidance of doubt
this shall include, by way of example, Reserved Matters (as such term is
defined in the Shareholders Agreement) reserved to the JVCo Board or the
shareholders in JVCo, share transfer provisions and rights of first refusal
set out in the Shareholders Agreement;

(iii) the nominal value of each quota shall be CHF100 (or, if higher, the

Subsidiary) shall exercise the above mentioned right and acquire all such KPK

(a) The Shareholders undertake (without limiting any other rights of Purchaser
(or any Permitted IP Assignee) in any way including its rights to damages in
respect of a claim for breach of any Shareholder Warranty on any other basis)
that if there is a breach of any Shareholder Warranty, they shall pay in cash
on demand to Purchaser (or any Permitted IP Assignee):

(i) any Indemnified Damages Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Parent
Group incurs or suffers, together with any related Purchaser Enforcement

by JVCo or any member of the JVCo Group: (1) in which JVCo holds, directly or
indirectly, any equity interest and/or (2) in relation to which JVCo has,

Matter listed in Section 2 of Schedule J hereto.

Section 10.3  _Limits on recoverability_.

the parties to disapply the principle of English law which excludes recovery
of consequential loss not in the reasonable contemplation of the parties.

(b) Purchaser shall take reasonable steps to avoid or mitigate any loss or
damage which it may suffer in consequence of any breach by the Shareholders or
the Guarantors of the terms of this Agreement or any fact, matter, event or
circumstance likely to give rise to a Warranty Claim or a Specified Matter
Claim other than claims arising out of the Specified Matter listed in Section
2 of Schedule J hereto; _provided_ , _that_ with respect to losses or damages
arising out of: (i) a Specified Matter, Purchaser shall, subject to its right
to act in its own interest as a shareholder of JVCo, only have to take such
steps as it is entitled to take under the relevant applicable law and (ii) a
Tax Warranty Claim, the Purchaser shall not be required to take any steps
which could cause it to breach the terms of the Tax Covenant.



 

60 Section 10.4 _Maximum total liability of Shareholders and Guarantors_.

(a) The total aggregate liability of the Shareholders under or in connection
with the Purchase Documents shall be limited to and shall not exceed the
Retention Amount for (i) all Warranty Claims arising out of a statement
contained in the Operating Business Warranties ("Operating Business Warranty
Claims") and (ii) all Specified Matter Claims (other than to the extent any
loss resulting from a Specified Matter is a loss resulting from a Tax or
Taxation matter), and the sole recourse for satisfaction of such liability
shall be the set off against amounts due under the Note in accordance
with Section 10.14 hereto and the provisions of the Note.

(b) The total aggregate liability of the Shareholders and the Guarantors
under or in connection with the Purchase Documents for Warranty Claims arising
out of a statement contained in the Tax Warranties ("Tax Warranty Claim") or

or in connection with the Purchase Documents for all Warranty Claims arising
out of a statement contained in the Title Warranties ("Title Warranty Claim")

(4) Mr Leonid Eruhimovich  the percentage of the Ilim Principal Liability

61 Section 10.5 _De minimis claims_.

(a) The Shareholders and the Guarantors shall not be liable in respect of a
Warranty Claim, a Specified Matter Claim (other than a claim pursuant to
Section 2 of Schedule J hereto) or a Tax Claim, unless the amount of liability
pursuant to that Warranty Claim, Specified Matter Claim or Tax Claim exceeds
USD100,000.

(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) above, Warranty Claims, Specified Matter
Claims or Tax Claims arising directly from the same fact or event (or series
of related facts or events) shall be treated as one individual Warranty Claim,
Specified Matter Claim or Tax Claim rather than a series of individual
Warranty Claims, Specified Matter Claims or Tax Claims.

Section 10.6 _Thresholds for Warranty Claims and Tax Claims_.

(i) The Shareholders and Guarantors shall only be liable for a Warranty Claim
or a Specified Matter Claim, other than a claim pursuant to Section 2 of
Schedule J hereto, a Title Warranty Claim or a Tax Warranty Claim, once the
total amount of all Warranty Claims, Specified Matter Claims and Tax Claims
not excluded by Section 10.5 exceeds USD25,000,000 (the "Overall Threshold"),
in which case Purchaser (or any Permitted IP Assignee) shall only be entitled
to claim for the excess over USD25,000,000.

(ii) The Shareholders and Guarantors shall only be liable for a Tax Warranty
Claim or a Tax Claim once the total amount of all Tax Warranty Claims and Tax
Claims not otherwise excluded by section 10.5 exceeds USD10,000,000 ("Tax
Threshold"), in which case Purchaser (or any Permitted IP Assignee) shall only
be entitled to claim for the excess over USD10,000,000.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt:

(1) the Shareholders and Guarantors shall be liable, subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement and the remaining Purchase Documents, in respect
of a Tax Warranty Claim or a Tax Claim as soon as the Tax Threshold has been
reached, irrespective of whether the Overall Threshold has been reached;

(2) any amounts counted for the purposes of reaching the Tax Threshold shall
also be counted for the purposes of reaching the Overall Threshold; and

(3) once the Overall Threshold has been reached, the Tax Threshold shall
cease to apply and the Shareholders and Guarantors shall, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement and the remaining Purchase Documents, then be
liable for the full amount of all Warranty Claims and Tax Claims (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, any such amounts as are included in the Overall
Threshold).

Section 10.7 _Limits on Warranties_. Each Warranty is only qualified by each
fact, matter or circumstance that is fairly disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule by reference to the Warranty in question.



 

62 Section 10.8 _Time limits_. The Shareholders and Guarantors shall not be
liable for a Warranty Claim, a Specified Matter Claim or a Tax Claim unless
Purchaser (or any Permitted IP Assignee) has given notice of the relevant fact
or event giving rise to the Warranty Claim, Specified Matter Claim or Tax
Claim:

(a) in the case of a Title Warranty Claim:

(i) within two years from the date on which either Purchaser (or any Permitted
IP Assignee) or the Shareholders, or any of their Subsidiaries or Connected
Persons, (together) cease to hold Shares; or

(ii) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date,

whichever is the later, _provided however that_ , the Shareholders shall have
no liability in respect of a Title Warranty Claim unless Purchaser (or any
Permitted IP Assignee) has given notice of the relevant fact or event giving
rise to that Title Warranty Claim, by the tenth anniversary of the Closing
Date;

(b) in the case of a Tax Warranty Claim or a Tax Claim, by 1 July of the
fourth year after the calendar year in which the Closing occurs; and

(c) in the case of any Operating Business Warranty Claim or any Specified
Matter Claim, within 18 months of the Closing Date.

Section 10.9 _Matters Provided For_. Neither the Shareholders nor the
Guarantors shall be liable for any Warranty Claim or any Specified Matter
Claim to the extent that the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise
to such claim is fully and specifically taken into account in any adjustment
to the Final Purchase Price.

Section 10.10 _Contingent liabilities_. If any Warranty Claim or Specified
Matter Claim is based upon a liability which is contingent only, neither the
Shareholders nor any Guarantor shall be liable to pay unless and until such
contingent liability gives rise to an obligation to make a payment (but, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser has the right to give notice of that
claim before such time).

Section 10.11 _No Double Recovery_. Purchaser shall not be entitled to
recover damages or obtain payment, reimbursement or indemnity under this
Agreement in respect of any one liability, loss, cost, shortfall, damage,
deficiency, breach or other set of circumstances which gives rise to a claim
or demand hereunder to the extent that it shall already have been fully
compensated in respect of such liability, loss, cost, shortfall, damage,
deficiency, breach or other set of circumstances under any other Purchase
Document.

Section 10.12 _Conduct of Claims Brought Directly Against Purchaser_.

(a) Purchaser shall give prompt written notice to the Ilim Shareholder
Representatives of any third-party claim brought directly against Purchaser
(or any other member of the International Paper Group) that may result in
Purchaser being entitled to make a Warranty Claim or a Specified Matter Claim,
other than a Tax Warranty Claim, together with the estimated  



 

63  amount of such claim. Failure to give such notice shall not affect the
entitlement of Purchaser to make a Warranty Claim or a Specified Matter Claim
in the absence of actual and material prejudice. Following receipt of such
notice, the Shareholders may then without undue delay opt either to (i)
confirm in writing to Purchaser that the Shareholders will satisfy such third
party claim or (ii) deliver to Purchaser a written notice of disagreement,
specifying in reasonable detail, based upon information then available, the
nature and extent of the disagreement. Unless Purchaser is of the opinion that
in light of the corporate interests of Purchaser, its Affiliates or the JVCo
Group, control of the defense by the Shareholders is inappropriate, the
Shareholders shall have the right to assume the defense (at the Shareholders
expense) of any such claim by notifying Purchaser in writing within 30 days
of the first receipt by the Ilim Shareholder Representatives of such notice
from Purchaser that the Shareholders (x) disagree with such claims and intend
to dispute such claims and (y) acknowledge that such claim if determined
adversely to Purchaser, its Affiliates or the JVCo Group is an obligation
entitling Purchaser to damages or indemnification under this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that unless and until
the Shareholders assume control pursuant to this Section 10.12, JVCo shall
have the right to assume the defense of any third-party claim, including the
right to appoint counsel of its own choosing. In assuming the defense of any
such matter, the Shareholders shall be entitled to appoint counsel of
Shareholders own choosing; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. If, under applicable standards
of professional conduct, a conflict with respect to any significant issue
between Purchaser (or any other member of the International Paper Group) and
any Shareholder exists in respect of such third-party claim, the Shareholders
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel as may
be required to be retained in order to resolve such conflict. The Shareholders
shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by Purchaser (or
any other member of the International Paper Group) for any period during
which the Shareholders have not assumed the defense of any such third-party
claim (other than during any period in which Purchaser will have failed to
give notice of the third-party claim as provided above). If the Shareholders
assume such defense, Purchaser shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Shareholders, it being understood that the
Shareholders shall control such defense. If the Shareholders choose to defend
or prosecute a third-party claim, Purchaser shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof, which cooperation shall include, to the extent reasonably
requested by the Shareholders, the retention, and the provision to
Shareholders, of records and information reasonably relevant to such third-
party claim, and making employees of the JVCo Group available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any materials provided hereunder. If the Shareholders defend or prosecute any
third-party claim, Purchaser shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of such third-party claim that the Shareholders may recommend and
that, by its terms, discharges Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser and any
member of the JVCo Group that is (or is reasonably likely to be) the subject
of such third-party claim from the full amount of liability in connection with
such third-party claim; provided, however, that, without the consent of
Purchaser, the Shareholders shall not consent to, and Purchaser shall not be
required to agree to, the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
that (i) provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting
Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser or any member of the JVCo Group or (ii)
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving of a release from
all liability with respect to such claim by each claimant or plaintiff to
Purchaser and each Affiliate of Purchaser that is (or is reasonably likely to
be) the subject of such third-party claim.



 

64 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, the conduct of any Tax Claim or Tax Warranty
Claim shall be governed by the relevant provisions of the Tax Covenant.

Section 10.13 _Conduct of Claims Brought Against JVCo_.

(a) JVCo shall give prompt written notice to the Ilim Shareholder
Representatives and to Purchaser of any third-party claim brought directly
against JVCo (or any other member of the JVCo Group) that is reasonably likely
to result in Purchaser being entitled to make a Warranty Claim or a Specified
Matter Claim, other than a Tax Warranty Claim, together with the estimated
amount of such claim. Failure to give such notice shall not affect the
entitlement of Purchaser to make a Warranty Claim or a Specified Matter Claim
in the absence of actual and material prejudice. Following receipt of such
notice, the Shareholders may then without undue delay opt either to (i)
confirm in writing to JVCo that the Shareholders will satisfy such third party
claim or (ii) deliver to JVCo a written notice of disagreement, specifying in
reasonable detail, based upon information then available, the nature and
extent of the disagreement. Unless JVCo is of the opinion that, based on the
corporate interests of JVCo or its Affiliates, control of the defense by the
Shareholders is inappropriate, the Shareholders shall have the right to
assume the defense (at the Shareholders expense) of any such claim by
notifying JVCo in writing within 30 days of the first receipt by the Ilim
Shareholder Representatives of such notice from JVCo that the
Shareholders (x) disagree with such claims and intend to dispute such claims
and (y) acknowledge that such claim if determined adversely to JVCo, its
Affiliates or the JVCo Group is an obligation entitling Purchaser to damages
or indemnification under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
understood that unless and until the Shareholders assume control pursuant to
this Section 10.13, JVCo shall have the right to assume the defense of any
third-party claim, including the right to appoint counsel of its own
choosing. In assuming the defense of any such matter, the Shareholders shall
be entitled to appoint counsel of Shareholders own choosing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to JVCo.
If, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict with
respect to any significant issue between JVCo (or any other member of the JVCo
Group) and any Shareholder exists in respect of such third-party claim,
the Shareholders shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
additional counsel as may be required to be retained in order to resolve such
conflict. The Shareholders shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by JVCo (or any other member of the JVCo Group) for any
period during which the Shareholders have not assumed the defense of any such
third-party claim (other than during any period in which JVCo will have failed
to give notice of the third-party claim as provided above). If the
Shareholders assume such defense, each of JVCo and Purchaser shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its or
their own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Shareholders,
it being understood that the Shareholders shall control such defense. If the
Shareholders choose to defend or prosecute a third-party claim, JVCo shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof, which cooperation shall
include, to the extent reasonably requested by the Shareholders, the
retention, and the provision to Shareholders, of records and information
reasonably relevant to such third-party claim, and making employees of the
JVCo Group available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder. If the  



 

65  Shareholders defend or prosecute any third-party claim, JVCo shall agree to
any settlement, compromise or discharge of such third-party claim that
the Shareholders may recommend and that, by its terms, discharges JVCo, any
Affiliate of JVCo and any member of the JVCo Group that is (or is reasonably
likely to be) the subject of such third-party claim from the full amount of
liability in connection with such third-party claim; provided, however, that,
without the consent of JVCo, the Shareholders shall not consent to, and JVCo
shall not be required to agree to, the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that (i) provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief
affecting JVCo, any Affiliate of JVCo or any member of the JVCo Group or (ii)
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving of a release from
all liability with respect to such claim by each claimant or plaintiff to
JVCo and each Affiliate of JVCo that is (or is reasonably likely to be) the
subject of such third-party claim.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the conduct of any Tax Claim or Tax Warranty
Claim shall be governed by the relevant provisions of the Tax Covenant.

Section 10.14 _Set-off_. Subject to Sections 10.4 and 10.15, the obligations
of the Shareholders and Guarantors to Purchaser (or any Permitted
IP Assignee) set forth in each of the Purchase Documents may be satisfied, in
whole or in part by: (i) set-off against the Note or any promissory note
issued pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, (ii) withholding or deduction
from any dividend otherwise payable to the Shareholders by JVCo pursuant to
Clauses 12.5 or 12.6 of the Shareholders Agreement or (iii) deduction from the
consideration payable for the Shares pursuant to paragraph 2.2 of Schedule 4
to the Shareholders Agreement or otherwise as permitted under the Transaction
Documents. If exercised pursuant to paragraph (i) above, such right of offset
shall be applied to the payment next due under such Note or such promissory
note after such right of offset is asserted, and, to the extent necessary to
satisfy such right of offset, to subsequent payments due under such Note or
such promissory note in the chronological order in which such payments are
scheduled. Where and to the extent that the amount payable under the relevant
Note represents a payment of interest, the right of set-off shall only be
exercisable against the amount of interest net of any withholding tax that is
required to be deducted by the Purchaser (or Permitted IP Assignee) or any
paying agent. In exercising the right of set-off, the Purchaser (or Permitted
IP Assignee) shall be making a payment under the relevant Note or promissory
note to the Purchaser but shall be deemed to have received instructions from
the Shareholders to apply such payment, on the Shareholders behalf, to
discharge up to the amount of the payment (net of any withholding tax) the
whole or part of an obligation of the Shareholders or the Guarantors (as the
case may be) to make a payment to the Purchaser (or Permitted IP Assignee)
under any of the Purchase Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment
under a Note or promissory note against which the right of set-off is asserted
shall be treated as cancelled, waived or written-off.

Section 10.15 _Sources of Settlement of Operating Business Warranty Claims,
Specified Matter Claims, Tax Warranty Claims and Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser (or any Permitted IP
Assignee) shall only be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment in
respect of:

(a) an Operating Business Warranty Claim or a Specified Matter Claim, by
setting off any such amount of damages or payment against the Note in
accordance with Section 10.14 of this Agreement and the terms of the Note.



 

66 (b) a Title Warranty Claim, Tax Warranty Claim or Tax Claim:

(i) firstly, at the election of Purchaser, and in accordance with Section
10.14 of this Agreement and the terms of the relevant Note or promissory note
issued under the Shareholders Agreement, by setting off any such amount of
damages or payment against:

(1) the Note, but only to the extent that the payment obligation of Purchaser
under the Note is not otherwise set-off in full as a result of a claim (or
claims) under any of the Purchase Documents; or

(2) any promissory note issued pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, but
only to the extent that the payment obligation of Purchaser under such
promissory note is not otherwise set-off in full as a result of a claim (or
claims) under any of the Purchase Documents; and

(ii) secondly, by direct claim against one or more of the Shareholders or, in
respect of liability under the Guarantee only, one or more of the Guarantors,
or by any other method provided for in the Purchase Documents or the
Shareholders Agreement.

Section 10.16 _Tax Effect of Payment_. All payments (other than payments of
interest) made by or on behalf of Shareholders to Purchaser (or any Permitted
IP Assignee), or by or on behalf of the Purchaser or Purchaser Parent (or any
Permitted IP Assignee) to Shareholders, by way of set-off under Section 10.14
or otherwise, pursuant to this Agreement, the Deed of Indemnity, the
Guarantee or the Tax Covenant shall be treated (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the consideration paid
with respect to the Sale Shares.

Section 10.17 _Effect of Investigation_. Subject only to Section 10.7, the
right of Purchaser (or any Permitted IP Assignee) to make or sustain a Claim
based on any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of any
Shareholder, Guarantor or JVCo contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement
or any of the other Transaction Documents shall not be affected by any
information, fact or circumstance of which Purchaser, any Affiliate of
Purchaser, any of their respective representatives or on its or their behalf
or otherwise, had knowledge (whether actual, imputed or constructive) or which
could have been discovered (whether by investigation, search or enquiry
(including of any Governmental Entity) made by Purchaser, any Affiliate of
Purchaser, any of their respective representatives or on its or their behalf
or otherwise) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the date the Closing occurs, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation (including any claim that any of the Warranties is or
was untrue, inaccurate, misleading or not complete, whether at the date of
this Agreement or on their repetition at Closing). For the avoidance of doubt:

(a) the waiver of any condition to the obligation of Purchaser to consummate
the Transaction, where such condition is based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, shall not affect any right Purchaser (or any Permitted
IP Assignee) may have to make or sustain a Claim based on such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation; and



 

67 (b) the liability of the Shareholders and Guarantors pursuant to the
Warranties on their repetition at Closing shall not be limited as a result of
any disclosure of additional facts, matters or circumstances after the date of
this Agreement or matters of which Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser, any
of their respective representatives or on its or their behalf or otherwise,
became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) after the date of this
Agreement.

Section 10.18 _Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties_. Each of
the covenants, representations and warranties of the Shareholders and
Guarantors in this Agreement or in any schedule, instrument or other
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date
and shall continue in force thereafter subject to all applicable limitations
and qualifications.

Section 10.19 _Waiver_. Each Shareholder and Guarantor agrees to waive the
benefit of all rights (if any) which they may have against any member of the
JVCo Group, or any present or former officer or employee of any such member,
on whom a Shareholder or Guarantor may have relied in agreeing to any terms of
this Agreement or any statement set out in the Disclosure Schedule and each
Shareholder and Guarantor undertakes not to make any claim in respect of
such reliance.

ARTICLE XI

_MISCELLANEOUS_

payable in connection with the Russian Anti Monopoly filing previously made
by the parties;

(b) The Shareholders as a group and Purchaser shall each bear half of the
Transfer Taxes arising out of, in connection with or attributable to the

avoidance of doubt, any Transfer Taxes arising out of, in connection with or
attributable to the Restructuring); provided that all other Transfer Taxes in
connection with the Transaction shall be borne and paid by Shareholders. The
Transfer Tax Payor shall prepare and timely file all relevant Tax Returns
required to be filed in respect of such Transfer Tax, pay the Transfer Tax
shown on such Tax Return, and notify the other parties in writing of the

Section 11.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

Section 11.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreements and the other Transaction Documents (each a "Document") constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. It is agreed that no party shall have any claim or remedy in
respect of any statement, representation, warranty or undertaking made by or
on behalf of any other party (or any of its Connected Persons) in relation to
the Transaction which is not expressly set out in this Agreement or any other
Document; provided, however, that this Section 11.5 shall not exclude any
liability for (or remedy in respect of) fraudulent misrepresentation or
deceit. Each party agrees to the terms of this Section 11.5 on its own behalf
and as agent for each of its Connected Persons.

Section 11.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term
or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision.

Section 11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

Section 11.8 _Enforcement_.

(a) All and any Disputes shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding
arbitration in accordance with the ICC Rules in force at the time of the
commencement of the arbitration, which ICC Rules are deemed to be incorporated
by reference into this clause save as amended below.



 

70 (b) There shall be three arbitrators, and the parties agree that one
arbitrator shall be nominated by each party to the Dispute for confirmation
by the ICC Court in accordance with the ICC Rules. The third arbitrator, who
shall act as the chairman of the tribunal, shall be nominated by agreement of
the two party-nominated arbitrators within fourteen days of the confirmation
of the appointment of the second arbitrator, or in default of such agreement,
appointed by the ICC Court.

(c) The seat or place of arbitration shall be London, England. The language to
be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The award shall be final
and binding on the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court
having jurisdiction.

(d) Where there are more than two parties to the Dispute, whether as claimant
or as respondent, the multiple claimants, jointly, and the multiple
respondents, jointly, shall nominate an arbitrator for confirmation by the ICC
Court in accordance with the ICC Rules. The third arbitrator, who shall act as
the chairman of the tribunal, shall be nominated by agreement of the two
party-nominated arbitrators within fourteen days of the confirmation of the
appointment of the second arbitrator, or in default of such agreement,
appointed by the ICC Court. In the absence of such a joint nomination and
where all parties are unable to agree to a method for the constitution of the
arbitral tribunal, the ICC Court may appoint each member of the arbitral
tribunal pursuant to Article 10(2) of the ICC Rules and shall designate one of
them to act as chairman.

(e) The parties agree that, in order to facilitate the comprehensive
resolution of related Disputes, and upon request of any party to an
arbitration pursuant to this section 11.8, an arbitral tribunal may within 90
days of appointment consolidate the arbitration with any other arbitration or
proposed arbitration involving any of the parties and relating to this Deed
and/or any other agreement between the parties or any of them. The
arbitrations may be consolidated, or heard concurrently, in such manner as the
arbitral tribunal determines in its discretion, save that the arbitral
tribunal shall not consolidate such arbitrations unless it determines that:
(a) there are issues of fact or law common to the arbitrations in question so
that a consolidated proceeding would be more efficient than separate
proceedings; and (b) no party would be prejudiced as a result of such
consolidation through undue delay or otherwise. In the event of different
rulings on the question of consolidation by differently constituted arbitral
tribunals, the ruling of the arbitral tribunal first formed shall be
determinative. Unless the parties to the proceedings sought to be consolidated
agree otherwise, the arbitral tribunal first formed shall determine the
Disputes arising in the consolidated proceedings.

(f) By agreeing to arbitration pursuant to this Section 11.8, the parties do
not intend to deprive any court or other governmental body or regulatory
agency of its jurisdiction to issue an interim injunction or other interim
relief or assistance in aid of the arbitration proceedings or for the
enforcement of any arbitral award, provided that the parties agree that they
may seek only such relief as is consistent with their agreement to resolve
Disputes by way of arbitration.

(g) Without prejudice to such provisional remedies that may be granted by a
national court in aid of arbitration, the arbitral tribunal shall have full
authority to grant interim or conservatory measures, to order a party to seek
modification or vacation of interim or conservatory measures issued by a
national court, and to award damages or give other appropriate relief for the
failure of any party to respect the arbitral tribunals orders to that effect.



 

71 Section 11.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 11.10 _Election of Remedies_. Neither the exercise of nor the failure
to exercise a right, including any right of set-off, or the giving or failure
to give notice of a Claim under this Agreement will constitute an election of
remedies or limit any party in any manner in the enforcement of any other
remedies that may be available to it, whether at law or in equity.

Section 11.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written content of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign, in its
sole discretion, any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Purchaser Parent (each a
"Permitted IP Assignee") provided that the liability of the Shareholders, the
Guarantors and JVCo under this Agreement shall not be increased thereby (other
than in respect of any withholding tax levied on payments of interest), and
if such assignee shall not be a wholly owned Subsidiary at any time after such
assignment, the Purchaser shall procure such rights and interests hereunder
shall be assigned back by such assignee to the Purchaser or another a
Permitted IP Assignee. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

Section 11.12 _Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999_. Save as
expressly provided in Section 11.5 in respect of Connected Persons,
this Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and thereto and a Person who is not a
party to this Agreement has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise to enforce any term of this Agreement.

Section 11.13 _Language_. This Agreement has been executed in English and
Russian. The governing language of this Agreement is English and all notices,
demands, requests, statements, certificates or other documents or
communications shall be in English unless otherwise agreed. In the event of
any discrepancies between the English and the Russian versions of this
Agreement or any dispute regarding the interpretation of any provision in the
English or Russian versions of this Agreement, the English version of this
Agreement shall prevail and questions of interpretation shall be addressed
solely in the English language.

Section 11.14 _Ilim Shareholder Representatives_.

(a) The Ilim Shareholder Representatives, one acting alone or two acting
jointly and not individually, shall serve as the agents of each of the
Shareholders and Guarantors  



 

72  as his or their agent, to act in his or their name, place and stead, as each
such Persons attorney-in-fact, to act for and on behalf of such
Person, including, without limitation:

(i) to make all elections or decisions (including those related to Taxes)
entered into in connection with this Agreement;

(ii) to amend, waive or otherwise change the terms or conditions of this
Agreement in respect of obligations or rights of the Shareholders;

(iii) to defend, commence any action or proceeding with respect to, settle
and make payments in connection with any claim for indemnity made under this
Agreement;

(iv) authorize delivery (and to object to the delivery) to Purchaser of any
funds and property in its possession in satisfaction of claims by Purchaser
(and each Shareholder and Guarantor recognizes and acknowledges, for the
benefit of Purchaser, that he, she or it shall have no independent right to
pursue any such claim);

(v) review and accept all calculations regarding payments and negotiate
any modifications thereto (and each Shareholder and Guarantor shall have no
independent right to pursue any claim regarding any payments, calculations,
modifications, settlements or compromises in respect thereof except in the
event of a failure to be paid in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement); and

(vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, letters
and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any
and all actions that the Ilim Shareholder Representatives, in their
sole discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection
with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all
other agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or
executed in connection herewith or therewith. Any proceeds or other assets
received by the Ilim Shareholder Representatives on behalf of the Shareholders
and the Guarantors from Purchaser shall be distributed to Shareholders and the
Guarantors as promptly as practicable by the Ilim Shareholder
Representatives, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this deed. The
death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation, insolvency or bankruptcy of any
Shareholder and the Guarantors shall not terminate such appointment or the
authority and agency of the Ilim Shareholder Representatives. The power-of-
attorney granted in this Section 11.14 is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable. No bond shall be required of the Ilim Shareholder
Representatives, and the Ilim Shareholder Representatives shall not receive
compensation for their services in their capacity as Ilim Shareholder
Representatives. Notices or communications to or from the Ilim Shareholder
Representatives shall constitute notice to or from each of the Shareholders
and the Guarantors during the term of the agency.

(b) The Ilim Shareholder Representatives shall be entitled to rely upon any
document or instrument reasonably believed by them to be genuine, accurate as
to content and signed by any Shareholder or Guarantor. The Ilim Shareholder
Representatives may assume that any person purporting to give any notice in
accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.



 

73 (c) The Ilim Shareholder Representatives shall be entitled to retain and rely
upon the advice of counsel or other professionals acceptable to them and to
incur such expenses as the Ilim Shareholder Representatives deem to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with their performance of their
obligations under this Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred by the Ilim Shareholder Representatives in connection with
this Agreement shall be jointly and severally borne by each Shareholder and
Guarantor, but in no event by Purchaser. The Ilim Shareholder Representatives
shall pursue such fees and expenses against the Shareholders and Guarantors
directly. Purchaser shall not have any liability or obligation to
any Shareholder or Guarantor for any losses incurred by the Ilim Shareholder
Representatives in their capacity as such, for the allocation of such losses
or for any other arrangements between the Ilim Shareholder Representatives.

(d) Messrs. Zakhar Smushkin and Boris Zingarevich shall serve as the Ilim
Shareholder Representatives until their resignation and replacement by
another Guarantor who has first agreed to act as Ilim Shareholder
Representative upon the terms of this Agreement. At no time shall more than
two persons be appointed or authorized to act as Ilim Shareholder
Representatives. 

(e) The decision, act, consent, instruction or omission of the Ilim
Shareholder Representatives shall constitute a decision, act, consent,
instruction or omission of all of the Shareholders and Guarantors and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each such Person, and, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 11.14 and notwithstanding any contrary action or
direction from any Shareholder or Guarantor, no such Person shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser may
reasonably rely upon any such decision, act, consent, instruction or omission
of the Ilim Shareholder Representatives as being the decision, act, consent,
instruction or omission of every Shareholder, all of which shall be binding on
the Shareholders and Guarantors. 

ARTICLE XII

_WITHHOLDING_

Section 12.1 _Withholding_. Each party shall pay all sums payable by them for
damages, breach of warranty or under an indemnity under this Agreement, and
all sums payable under any other Transaction Document, free and clear of all
deductions or withholdings unless the law requires a deduction or withholding,
if so required and except in the case of interest payments each party shall
pay such additional amount as will ensure that the net amount the payee
receives equals the full amount which it would have received had the deduction
or withholding not been required provided however that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that the deduction or withholding would not have
arisen but for:

(a) a change in law after Closing; or



 

74 (b) an assignment by Purchaser of any of its rights under this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered as a
deed on the date appearing at the head of this Agreement.
