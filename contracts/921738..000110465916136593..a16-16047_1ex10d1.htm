Schedule_**. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to
the Paying Agent, together with delivery of a Seller Transmittal Letter, duly
executed and properly completed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate (each such holder, a " **
_Surrendering Holder_** ") shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange
therefor from the Paying Agent such Surrendering Holders pro rata portion of
the Net Consideration Fund in respect of the Company Stock Certificate
surrendered, pursuant to the calculation in **_Section 2.3(a)_** and as set
forth in the **_Securityholders Schedule_** , after giving effect to any

Earnings on the Net Consideration Fund shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Buyer, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of
the Sellers or the Former In-the-Money Option Holders.

 



 

(vi) **_Transfers of Ownership_**. If the cash payment or check evidencing the
cash to be paid pursuant to **_Section 2.3_** hereof is to be made to a
Person other than the Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Buyer or any agent designated by it any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of any portion of the Estimated
Initial Purchase Price in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Buyer or
any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(vii) **_Paying Agent to Return Consideration_**. Any funds that have not been
distributed to the Seller Indemnifying Parties within six (6) months after
such funds were received by the Depository Agent shall be delivered to Buyer.
Any former Seller Indemnifying Party who has not theretofore complied with
this **_Section 2.2_** shall thereafter look only to the Company for any
portion of the Estimated Initial Purchase Price, deliverable in respect of
each share of Common Stock or each Inthe-Money Vested Option such Person
held, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.
If the holder of any Company Stock Certificates which formerly represented
shares of Company Capital Stock shall not have surrendered such Company Stock
Certificates, or any Seller Indemnifying Party shall not have complied with
this **_Section 2.2(c)_**, by the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the
Closing Date (or such earlier date as shall be immediately prior to such date
as the applicable portion of the Total Consideration or any amounts payable
from the Escrow Fund would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
governmental entity), to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
entitlement of such holder to such portion of the Estimated Initial Purchase
Price under this Agreement shall be extinguished absolutely.

 



 

(viii) **_Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_**. In the event any Company
Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or
agreements, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such consideration, if any, as may be required pursuant to **_Section
2.2(c)_** hereof; **_provided_** , **_however_** , that the Paying Agent
shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates to provide an affidavit of loss and deliver a bond in such amount
as it may reasonably direct, indemnifying Buyer and the Paying Agent against
any claim that may be made against Company or the Paying Agent with respect to
the certificates or agreements alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(ix) **_No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_**. The portion
of the Estimated Initial Purchase Price paid or payable in respect of the
surrender for exchange of the Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(x) **_No Liability_**. None of the Paying Agent, Depository Agent, Buyer or
its Affiliates, and following Closing, the Company, nor any other Person shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Estimated Initial
Purchase Price delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

2.3 **_Purchase Price_** **.**

 



 

(a) **_Treatment of Common Stock_**.

 



 

(i) Promptly after receipt of each Sellers Seller Letter of Transmittal, the
Paying Agent shall pay to each such Seller who holds Shares in respect of such
Shares an amount equal to (x) the Initial Purchase Price Per Share,
**_multiplied by_** (y) the number of shares of Common Stock opposite such
Sellers name in the "Common Stock" column in the **_Securityholders
Schedule_**.

 



 

(ii) Following the Closing, each Seller holding Shares in respect of such
Shares shall be entitled to receive an amount, if any, equal to:

 



 

(A) each such Sellers Fully Diluted Pro Rata Percentage of a Working Capital
Surplus Payment, if any, pursuant to **_Section 2.4_**;

 



 

(B) each such Sellers Fully Diluted Pro Rata Percentage of an Earnout
Payment, if any, pursuant to **_Section 2.5_**; and

remaining Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund Amount, in each case, if any,
pursuant to **_Section 8.3_** and **_Section 8.5_**, respectively.

 



 

(a) **_Treatment of Company Options_**.

 



 

(i) No outstanding Company Option (whether vested or unvested) shall be
assumed by, continued in effect or replaced by Buyer pursuant to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
has taken or shall take all actions necessary so that, at the Closing, each
Company Option (whether vested or unvested) that is unexpired, unexercised and
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall terminate and be cancelled
as of the Closing. Each Option Holder who is a holder of a Company Option
which is not an In-the-Money Vested Option immediately prior to the Closing
shall not be entitled to receive any payment therefor. Each Option Holder who
is a holder of an In-the-Money Vested Option immediately prior to the Closing
(each a " ** _Former In-the-Money Option Holder_** " and together, the " **
_Former In-the-Money Option Holders_** ") shall be entitled to receive in
exchange for the cancellation thereof, without interest, payment in cash in an
amount equal to:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) At the time specified in **_Section 2.2(c)(iii)_**, (x) the Initial
Purchase Price Per Share, **_multiplied by_** (y) the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the In-the-Money Vested
Option opposite such Former In-the-Money Option Holders name in the " ** _In-
the-Money Vested Options_** " column in the **_Securityholders Schedule_** ,
**_minus_** (z) the aggregate exercise price for all shares of Common Stock
that would be issuable upon exercise of such Former In-the-Money Option
Holders In-the-Money Vested Option(s) immediately prior to the Closing (the
aggregate of all such payments being the " ** _Option Closing Payments_** ");

 



 

(B) Following the Closing, each Former In-the-Money Option Holder shall be
entitled to receive in respect of his or her In-the-Money Vested Option an
amount, if any, equal to:

 



 

(1) each such Former In-the-Money Option Holders Fully Diluted Pro Rata
Percentage of a Working Capital Surplus Payment, if any, pursuant to
**_Section 2.4_**;

 



 

(2) each such Former In-the-Money Option Holders Fully Diluted Pro Rata
Percentage of an Earnout Payment, if any, pursuant to **_Section 2.5_**; and

 



 

(3) each such Former In-the-Money Option Holders Indemnity Pro Rata
Percentage of the release of the remaining Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund
Amount, in each case, if any, pursuant to **_Section 8.3_** and **_Section
8.5_**, respectively.

 



 

(ii) All payments to Option Holders holding In-the-Money Vested Options shall
be made on the same schedule and on the same terms and conditions as applied
to the Sellers generally and in all events in accordance with the requirements
set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv). Each such payment
to an Option Holder who is or was an employee of the Company (less applicable
Tax withholdings) shall be paid through the employee payroll system of the
Company (or any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto) no later than its next
regularly scheduled payroll date immediately following the date on which such
amount becomes payable to such Option Holder. Each such payment to an Option
Holder who is not, and was not previously, an employee of the Company shall be
paid directly to such Option Holder by the Paying Agent promptly after receipt
of such Option Holders Option Holder Transmittal Letter.

 



 

(iii) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall send a notice to all Option
Holders (in a form acceptable to Buyer and at the time and in the manner
required by the Company Stock Plan), which notice shall (A) notify the Option
Holders of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) describe
the treatment of Company Options pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause each holder of
Company Options that are not In-the-Money Vested Options to execute and
deliver an Option Cancellation Agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as **_Exhibit I_**.

 



 

2.4 **_Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment_**.

 



 

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to the Sellers Representative a statement (the " ** _Closing
Statement_** ") setting forth the Closing Company Cash, the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing Net Working
Capital and Buyers resulting calculation of the Initial Purchase Price. The
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the applicable
definitions set forth in this Agreement. The Sellers Representative shall
cooperate as reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the
Sellers Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement and any period of
dispute with respect thereto thereafter, Buyer shall provide the

 



       
 

 



 

Sellers Representative with reasonable access during normal business hours to
the relevant books, records and documents supporting data for purposes of its
review of the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement and the resulting
calculation of the Initial Purchase Price shall become final and binding on
the parties thirty (30) days following the Sellers Representatives receipt
thereof unless the Sellers Representative gives written notice of its
disagreement (a " ** _Notice of Disagreement_** ") to Buyer prior to such date
specifying in reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any
disagreement so asserted; **_provided that_** the Closing Statement and the
resulting calculation of the Initial Purchase Price shall become final and
binding upon the parties upon the Sellers Representatives delivery, prior to
the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, of written notice to Buyer of
its acceptance of the Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer, then the Closing
Statement (as revised in accordance with this **_Section 2.4_**), and the
resulting calculation of the Initial Purchase Price, shall become final and
binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i) the date any and all matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved in writing by the
Sellers Representative and Buyer and (ii) the date any and all matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement not resolved by the Sellers
Representative and Buyer are finally resolved in writing by the Expert. The
Closing Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect any
resolution by the Sellers Representative and Buyer and any final resolution
made by the Expert in accordance with this **_Section 2.4(b)_**. During the
twenty (20) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement or such longer period as the Sellers Representative and Buyer
may agree in writing, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect
to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such
twenty (20) day period, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall submit to
the Expert for review and resolution of any and all matters (but only such
matters) which remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of
Disagreement. Buyer and Sellers Representative shall instruct the Expert to
make a final determination of the items included in the Closing Statement (to
the extent such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Buyer and the Sellers Representative will cooperate (and Buyer
shall cause the Company to cooperate) with the Expert during the term of its
engagement. Buyer and Sellers Representative shall instruct the Expert not
to, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for
such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers Representative,
on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers Representative, on the other hand.
Buyer and Sellers Representative shall also instruct the Expert to make its
determination based solely on presentations by Buyer and Sellers
Representative that are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set
forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review).
The Closing Statement, the determination of the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing Net Working Capital and the
resulting calculation of the Initial Purchase Price shall become final and
binding on the parties hereto on the date the Expert delivers its final
resolution in writing to Buyer and the Sellers Representative (which final
resolution shall be delivered not more than thirty (30) days following
submission of such disputed matters), and such resolution by the Expert shall
not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable. The fees and expenses
of the Expert pursuant to this **_Section 2.4(b)_** shall be borne by the
Company, on the one hand, and the Seller Indemnifying Parties (based on each
Seller Indemnifying Partys Fully Diluted Pro Rata Percentages), on the other
hand, based upon the percentage which the aggregate portion of the contested
amount awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such
party, as determined by the Expert. For example, if the Sellers
Representative claims the Initial Purchase Price is $1,000 greater than the
amount determined by Buyer, and Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed
by the Sellers Representative, and if the Expert ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding the Seller Indemnifying Parties $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Expert will be allocated 60%
(i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Company and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Seller
Indemnifying Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If the Initial Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with
this **_Section 2.4_** (the " ** _Definitive Initial Purchase Price_** ") is
greater than the Estimated Initial Purchase Price (the positive amount by
which the Definitive Initial Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Initial
Purchase Price, the " ** _Working Capital Surplus Amount_** "), then Buyer,
within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and
binding in accordance with the terms hereof (the " ** _Closing Statement
Date_** "), shall make payment to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Working Capital Surplus
Amount (a " ** _Working Capital Surplus Payment_** ") for disbursement to the
Seller Indemnifying Parties in accordance with each Seller Indemnifying
Partys Fully Diluted Pro Rata Percentage; **_provided_** , **_however_** ,
that the Paying Agents disbursement for the portion of such Working Capital
Surplus Payment to be paid to the Former In-the-Money Option Holders in
respect of their In-the-Money Vested Options who are or were employees of the
Company be remitted directly to the Company (or any Affiliate thereof or
successor thereto) for payment via payroll in accordance with **_Section
2.3(b)(ii)_**. If the Estimated Initial Purchase Price is greater than the
Definitive Initial Purchase Price (the positive amount by which the Estimated
Initial Purchase Price exceeds the Definitive Initial Purchase Price, the " **
_Working Capital Deficit Amount_** "), then, Buyer may recover from the Escrow
Fund an amount equal to the Working Capital Deficit Amount (a " ** _Working
Capital Deficit Payment_** "). In the event the Escrow Fund is insufficient to
pay a Working Capital Deficit Payment, the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall
promptly (but no later than three (3) Business Days) wire, in immediately
available funds, to Buyer the amount by which the Working Capital Deficit
Amount exceeds the Escrow Fund in accordance with each Seller Indemnifying
Partys Fully Diluted Pro Rata Percentages.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall have the right to offset against any Working Capital Surplus
Payment any claims for which it is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, subject to the limitations on such indemnification set forth in
**_Section 8.2_**.

 



 

2.5 **_Earnout_**.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled
to receive from Buyer (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
**_Section 2.5_**) additional cash consideration based on the Companys
performance during the twelve month period beginning on the Closing Date (the
" ** _First Earnout Period_** ") and the twelve month period following the end
of the First Earnout Period (the " ** _Second Earnout Period_** " and the
First Earnout Period each, an " ** _Earnout Period_** " and collectively, the
" ** _Earnout Periods_** "). The amount (if any) paid with respect to the
First Earnout Period (the " ** _First Earnout Payment_** "), the initial
amount (if any) paid with respect to the Second Earnout Period (the " **
_Second Base Earnout Payment_** "), the amount in addition to the Second Base
Earnout Payment (if any) paid with respect to the Second Earnout Period (the "
** _Second Upside Earnout Payment_** " together with the First Earnout Payment
and the Second Base Earnout Payment, the " ** _Earnout Payments_** " and each
an " ** _Earnout Payment_** "), each shall be determined in accordance with
this **_Section 2.5_**. Within ten (10) days after the amount of any such
Earnout Payment has been finally determined pursuant to this **_Section
2.5_**, if any, Buyer shall make payment to the Paying Agent by wire transfer
of immediately available funds an amount equal to any such Earnout Payment for
disbursement to the Seller Indemnifying Parties in accordance with each Seller
Indemnifying Partys Fully Diluted Pro Rata Percentage; **_provided_** ,
**_however_** , that the Paying Agents disbursement of the portion of such
amount, if any, to be paid to the Former In-the-Money Option Holders in
respect of their In-the-Money Vested Options who are or were employees of the
Company shall be distributed to the Company (or any Affiliate thereof or
successor thereto) for payment via payroll in accordance with **_Section
2.3(b)(ii)_**.

 



 

(b) The amount of the Earnout Payments (if any) shall be determined as set
forth in this **_Section 2.5_**.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) The First Earnout Payment shall equal the positive amount by which (A)
6.25 **_times_** the TTM EBITDA for the First Earnout Period **_exceeds_** (B)

(f) Buyer shall have the right to offset against any Earnout Payment any
claims for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement,

Earnout Payment, and thus subject to offset, for purposes of this **_Section
2.5(f)_** and **_Section 8.2._**

 



 

(g) The right of any Seller Indemnifying Party to receive any Earnout Payment

any such Transfer in violation of this **_Section 2.5_** shall be null and
void).

Employees Pro Rata Fully-Diluted Percentage of such Earnout Payment, to the
extent payable in respect of Shares pursuant **_Section 2.3(a)_**, shall be

without interest thereon, on the first (1st) anniversary of the date on which
such portion of such Earnout Payment would have otherwise been payable by
Buyer to such Key Employee; **_provided_** , **_however_** , that such
deferral shall not apply if such Key Employee (i) is terminated without Cause,
(ii) voluntarily resigns for Good Reason or (iii) dies.

 



 

(i) The Seller Indemnifying Parties, the Company and Buyer intend that (i) no
portion of an Earnout Payment, if any, to the extent payable in respect of
Shares pursuant **_Section 2.3(a)_**, shall be treated as compensation for
any Tax purpose (and therefore shall not constitute deferred compensation to
which Section 409A could apply), and (ii) each Earnout Payment, if any, to the
extent payable in respect of Shares pursuant **_Section 2.3(a)_**, shall
qualify under the exception for transaction-based payments of deferred
compensation under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A). All
references in this **_Section 2.5_** to Section 409A or any Treasury
Regulations thereunder have been included solely for the purpose of ensuring

Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative or the then
current Chief Executive Officer of the Companys business, on

 



      
 

 



 

the other hand); and (2) avoid taking actions or failing to take actions the
primary purposes of which is to prevent the Company from satisfying Earnout

engage in discounting, promotional and refund practices that are materially

change the base salary and bonus compensation structure for personnel of the
Company from those in effect immediately following the Closing, or (3) other

be subject to the final approval of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers
Representative, on the other hand: (i) the Buyer Parties and the Company will

the parties recognize and agree that (x) neither Buyers Affiliates nor Buyer

Buyer Compliance Matters and that would reasonably be expected to have any
negative impact on TTM EBITDA, (x) the parties will work together in good
faith to undertake commercially reasonable steps (not inconsistent with the
Buyer Compliance Matters) to

 



      
 

 



 

minimize such negative impact at Buyers expense and (y) any remaining
negative impact actually suffered by the Company during the Earnout Period
shall be credited to TTM EBITDA to the extent such impact is tangible and

all or substantially all of the assets of the Companys business (a " **
_Business Sale_** "), Buyer shall cause the third party acquiring a Company
product and/or the business of the Company, as applicable, to assume the
obligations of Buyer under this **_Section 2.5_** (and Buyer shall not by

Business, as applicable. In the event of any assumption of any obligations of

shall enter into an agreement with the Sellers Representative, on behalf of
the Sellers and the Former In-the-Money Option Holders, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Sellers Representative, agreeing to be bound by the
applicable provisions of this Agreement. In the event of such Product Sale or
Business Sale the Buyer and Sellers Representative will work in good faith to
mutually determine the treatment of any proceeds of such Product Sale or
Business Sale with respect to the calculation of TTM EBITDA under this
Agreement. If the Buyer and Sellers Representative are unable to determine
treatment of such sale proceeds for purposes of the calculation of TTM EBITDA
within twenty (20) days of the consummation of such sale, the Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall submit such matter to a mutually acceptable
third party valuation expert. Buyer and Sellers Representative shall instruct
such valuation expert to make a final determination of such TTM EBITDA
treatment, by reference to the proceeds from the sale and the then- current
marketplace as well as the original terms and conditions of this Agreement.

the Company to cooperate) with the valuation expert during the term of its
engagement. The determination of the valuation expert shall become final and

submission of such matter), and such resolution by such expert shall not be
subject to court review or otherwise appealable.

references to "Buyer" for references to "the Company" in the definition
thereof) occurs during such period, Buyer shall cause Buyers successor entity
or surviving entity to assume the obligations of Buyer under this **_Section
2.5_** (and, if Buyer survives such transaction, Buyer shall not by such
assumption be relieved of its obligations under this **_Section 2.5_**). In
the event of any assumption of any obligations of Buyer under the preceding
sentence, Buyers successor entity or surviving entity shall enter into an
agreement with the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers and the
Former In-the-Money Option Holders, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Sellers Representative, agreeing to be bound by the applicable provisions of
this Agreement.

such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
law. To the extent that amounts

 



      
 

 



 

are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such

under this **_Section 4.13_**. The obligations of Buyer, the Company, and its
successors under this **_Section 4.13_** shall not be terminated, amended, or

or increase the amount of, or result in the forfeiture of compensation or
benefits under any Plan, except as required by applicable law.

provides for any retrospective premium adjustment or other experience-based
liability on the part of the Company.

(a) the representations and warranties of the Company in **_Section 5.2_**
(Capital Stock and Related Matters; Title to Shares), **_Section 5.3(a)_**
(Authorization), **_Section 5.19_** (Tax Matters) (collectively, the " **

(b) all representations and warranties other than the Fundamental

 ** _provided that_** any representation, warranty or matter in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under **_Section 8.2_** below, and the
indemnity with respect thereto, shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to this **_Section 8.1_** if notice of the
inaccuracy or breach or potential inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to
such right or potential right of indemnity shall have been given to the party
against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time (regardless of

Exhibits attached hereto or in any writing delivered by any party to another
party in connection with this Agreement shall survive for the periods set

acceptance by any party of any certificate or opinion hereunder. The
indemnification obligations of the parties hereto with respect to the
performance of any covenant or agreement herein shall survive the Closing in

indemnification obligations under **_Section 8.2(a)(iv)_** shall survive the
Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations plus
sixty (60) days.

 



 

8.2 **_Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) **_Indemnification_**. Each Seller and Former In-the-Money Option Holder
(each, a " ** _Seller Indemnifying Party_** ", and collectively, the " **
_Seller Indemnifying Parties_** ") (severally and not jointly) agrees to and
shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties and save and hold each of them
harmless against and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Buyer Indemnified
Parties as and when incurred for any Losses which any such Buyer Indemnified
Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result of, in connection
with, relating or incidental to or by virtue of:

 



 

(i) any breach by any Seller, the Sellers Representative or the Company of
any representation or warranty made by any Seller, the Sellers Representative
or the Company in this Agreement or any of the Schedules or Exhibits attached
hereto, or in any of the certificates furnished by any Seller, the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement (which (A) breach and (B) any Losses relating thereto shall each be
determined for purposes of this **_Section 8.2_** without regard to any
qualification based on materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in
such representations and warranties, _provided_ that any applicable matter or
related series of applicable matters to which the foregoing materiality
scrape applies shall constitute a breach and be indemnifiable under this
**_Section 8.2(a)(i)_**, if and only if the aggregate Losses relating to any
applicable matter or related series of applicable matters equals or exceeds
$15,000);

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by any Seller Indemnifying Party
or the Sellers Representative under this Agreement or any of the Schedules
and Exhibits attached hereto, or in any of the certificates furnished by any
Seller Indemnifying Party or the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Seller Indemnifying Parties) pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company prior to the
Closing under this Agreement or any of the Schedules and Exhibits attached
hereto, or in any of the certificates furnished by the Company pursuant to
this Agreement;

 



 

(iv) any Indemnified Taxes to the extent the amount of such item of
Indemnified Taxes exceeds the amount, if any, accrued for such item of
Indemnified Taxes as part of the Closing Indebtedness (as finally determined
under **_Section 2.4_**);

 



 

(v) all Transaction Expenses to the extent not appearing on the **_Transaction
Expenses Schedule_** ; or

 



 

(vi) any payment or consideration arising under any consents, notices,
waivers, terminations, modifications or approvals of any party under any
agreement as are required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or for any such agreement to remain in full force or effect following
the Closing;

 



 

(vii) any inaccuracy or omission in the **_Securityholders Schedule_** ;

 



 

(viii) any claim by any former Option Holder that they are entitled to any
additional compensation or payment of any kind in respect of their Company
Option, other than as provided in this Agreement; or

 



      
 

 



 

(ix) any of the matters set forth on the **_Specific Indemnity Schedule_**
attached hereto.

 



 

(b) **_[Reserved]_**.

 



 

(c) **_Limitations_**.

 



 

(i) **_Liability Cap_**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller
Indemnifying Parties aggregate liability under clause **_Section
8.2(a)(i)_** above (other than for Exempted Losses and the Specific Indemnity
Losses, which shall not exceed the Definitive Initial Purchase Price,
inclusive of the Escrow Amount) shall in no event exceed the Escrow Amount
(the " ** _Cap_** ") with it being understood, however, that nothing in this
Agreement (including this **_Section 8.2(c)_**) shall limit or restrict any
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties right to maintain or recover any amounts
directly from the Seller Indemnifying Parties in accordance with each Seller
Indemnifying Parties Indemnity Pro Rata Percentage in connection with any
criminal activity of any Seller Indemnifying Party or the Company or action,
inaction or claim based upon fraud, intentional misrepresentation, intentional
breach or willful misconduct by any Seller Indemnifying Party or the Company
(collectively, " ** _Fraud_** ").

 



 

(ii) **_Tipping Basket_**. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, a Buyer Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under
**_Section 8.2(a)(i)_** unless and until such Losses under **_Section
8.2(a)(i)_** exceed $150,000 in the aggregate (the " ** _Basket Amount_** "),
in which case Buyer shall be entitled to recover the aggregate amount of all
Losses from the first dollar. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be
entitled to recover for, and the Basket Amount shall not apply as a threshold
to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to Losses resulting from
or arising out of (i) any breach or alleged breach of a Fundamental
Representation, (ii) ** _Section 8.2(a)(ii)-(viii)_** (collectively, the "
** _Exempted Losses_** "), (iii) ** _Section 8.2(a)(ix)_** (the " **
_Specific Indemnity Losses_** ") and (iv) Fraud (the " ** _Fraud Losses_** ").

 



 

(iii) **_Applicability of Limitations_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any
Buyer Indemnified Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss
under this **_Section 8.2_** notwithstanding the fact that such Buyer
Indemnified Party had knowledge of the alleged breach or breach, event or
circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any
condition to the Closing related thereto. The waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification under this **_Section 8.2_** based on such representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations.

 



 

(iv) **_[Reserved]_**.

 



 

(v) **_No Duplication of Recovery_**. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, (i) to the extent that any Losses resulting
from any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company under this Agreement is taken into account (x) as a current liability,
reserved or accrued, or otherwise accounted for, in determining Closing Net
Working Capital, (y) in the calculation of the Closing Indebtedness or
Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, or (z) otherwise in the calculation of
the Aggregate Purchase Price, in each case, only with respect to the Losses
taken into account with respect to clauses (x) through (z) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, not Losses which exceed the Losses taken into account with
respect to clauses (x) through (z), (A) no Buyer Indemnified Party may recover
such Losses through a claim pursuant to **_ARTICLE VIII _**or otherwise and
(B) such Losses will not be included in the determination of whether all
Losses, in the aggregate, exceed the Basket Amount or the Cap; and (ii) no
Buyer Indemnified Party may recover duplicative damages in respect of a single
set of facts or circumstances under more than one

 



      
 

 



 

representation or warranty in this Agreement regardless of whether such facts
or circumstances would give rise to a breach of more than one representation
or warranty in this Agreement.

 



 

(vi) **_Calculation of Losses_**. Any claim for Losses will be calculated: (i)
without regard to reductions or diminutions in value, lost opportunities or
other speculative damages, and (ii) without regard to any punitive, exemplary,
special, incidental, or consequential damages, **provided** ; **however** that
(x) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover punitive damages to
the extent punitive damages are actually awarded to a third party by a
Governmental Authority, (y) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover exemplary, special, incidental, or consequential damages to the extent
such damages are actually paid to a third party in connection with a third
party claim, and (z) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
any special or consequential damages that are reasonably foreseeable under an
objective standard. Costs and expenses incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party
in investigating, defending or resolving any third party claim shall
constitute Losses if and solely if other Losses arising from such third party
claim are indemnifiable hereunder.

 



 

(vii) **_Insurance_**. The amount of any Losses payable under this **_ARTICLE
VIII_** will be net of amounts actually received by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under applicable insurance policies issued by insurance companies with
respect to such Losses (determined after giving effect to any deductible
associated therewith, any increase in premiums (including retro premium
obligations) resulting therefrom and net of Taxes or other liabilities
incurred by such Indemnified Person and/or any of its Affiliates as a result
of such claim and out-of-pocket costs of collecting such insurance proceeds)
or third party indemnification or contribution payments.

 



 

(viii) **_Sole and Exclusive Remedy_**. Except in the case of Fraud Losses,
the right of the parties to be indemnified pursuant to this **_ARTICLE
VIII_** will be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to all post-Closing
monetary Losses under this Agreement and with respect to a particular Seller
Indemnifying Party, under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to
which such Seller Indemnifying Party is a party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this **_ARTICLE VIII_** will limit any partys right to
seek and obtain specific performance or injunctive relief to which any party
may be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any partys Fraud.

 



 

(ix) **_Independent Investigation; Non-Reliance_**. Buyer has conducted its
own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition,
software, technology and prospects of the Company, which investigation was
conducted by Buyer and its Affiliates and representatives. In entering into
this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the
aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and not on any factual
representations or opinions of Company or its representatives (except for the
representations and warranties contained in **_ARTICLE V_**). Except for the
representations and warranties contained in **_ARTICLE V_**, Buyer
acknowledges and agree that none of the Company or their respective Affiliates
or representatives nor any other Person makes any other express, implied or
statutory representation or warranty with respect to the Company, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, including any
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
title, enforceability or non-infringement or with respect to any projections,
estimates and budgets for Company. None of the provisions of this **_Section
8.2(c)(ix)_** shall be construed as to limit a Buyer Indemnified Partys
ability to establish Fraud or recover Fraud Losses.

 



 

(d) **_Satisfaction of Claims_**.

 



 

(i) **_General Claims_**. All claims other than Exempted Losses, Specific
Indemnity Losses and Fraud (the " ** _General Claims_** ") brought by a Buyer
Indemnified Party for Losses shall be satisfied as follows: (A) first, from
the Escrow Fund (by reducing the amount of such Escrow

 



       
 

 



 

Amount therein) and (B) second, by offsetting such amounts against the Earnout
Payments (resulting in a reduction of such Earnout Payments), if any, as such
Earnout Payments become due and payable pursuant to **_Section 2.5_**;
**_provided_** , **_however_** , the aggregate liability of the Seller
Indemnifying Parties relating to the General Claims in the aggregate shall not
exceed the Escrow Amount.

 



 

(ii) **_Exempted Claims_**. Claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party for Exempted
Losses and Specific Indemnity Losses (the " ** _Exempted Claims_** "), shall
be satisfied: (A) first, from the Escrow Fund (by reducing the amount of the
Escrow Amount therein), (B) second, by offsetting such amounts due and owing
against a Working Capital Payment, if any (C) third, by offsetting such
amounts against the Earnout Payments, if any, as such Earnout Payments become
due and payable pursuant to **_Section 2.5_**, and (D) finally, if the Escrow
Amount, Working Capital Payment, the Earnout Payments then due and owing, if
any, are insufficient, by the Seller Indemnifying Parties directly (severally
and not jointly) based on their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Percentage;
**_provided_** , **_however_** , the Exempted Claims in the aggregate shall
not exceed the Definitive Initial Purchase Price (inclusive of the Escrow
Amount). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this **_Section
8.2(d)(ii)_**, the Exempted Claims shall be satisfied only after, in each
case, satisfying all the General Claims first.

 



 

(iii) **_Fraud Claims_**. Claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party for Fraud
committed by any Seller or the Company (prior to Closing) under this Agreement
(" ** _Fraud Claims_** "), shall be satisfied: (A) first, from the Escrow
Amount (by reducing the amount of such Escrow Amount), (B) second, by
offsetting such amounts against the Earnout Payments (resulting in a reduction
of such Earnout Payments), if any, as such Earnout Payments become due and
payable pursuant to **_Section 2.5_**, and (C) and finally, if the Escrow
Amount and the Earnout Payments then due and owing, if any, are insufficient
to satisfy the Fraud Claims in full, by the Seller Indemnifying Parties
directly (severally and not jointly) based on their respective Indemnity Pro
Rata Percentage; **_provided_** , **_however_** , the Fraud Claims shall be
satisfied only after, in each case, satisfying all the General Claims first
and the Exempted Claims second pursuant to this **_Section 8.2(d)_**.

 



 

(e) **_Claims for Indemnification_**.

 



 

(i) **_Officer s Claim Certificate_**. If at any time prior to the Survival
Date, the Fundamental Rep Survival Date, or the Specific Indemnity Survival
Date, as applicable, a Buyer Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim
for indemnification pursuant to this **_Section 8.2_**, such Buyer
Indemnified Party may deliver to the Sellers Representative a certificate
signed by any officer of such Buyer Indemnified Party (any certificate
delivered in accordance with the provisions of this **_Section 8.2(e)_**, an
" ** _Officer s Claim Certificate_**") which includes the following:

 



 

(A) a statement that a Buyer Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this **_Section 8.2_**;

 



 

(B) to the extent possible, a good faith non-binding, preliminary estimate of
the amount of all indemnifiable Losses to which such Buyer Indemnified Party
claims to be entitled to receive under this **_Section 8.2_**, which shall be
the amount of Losses such Buyer Indemnified Party has so incurred or suffered
or could reasonably be expected to incur or suffer in the future; and

 



 

(C) the material facts in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by such Buyer Indemnified Party) known to such Buyer Indemnified
Party giving rise to such claim.

 



 

(ii) No delay or failure in providing such Officers Claim Certificate prior
to the Survival Date, Fundamental Rep Survival Date or Specific Indemnity
Survival Date, as applicable,

 



      
 

 



 

shall affect a Buyer Indemnified Partys rights hereunder, unless the Sellers
Representative demonstrates actual material damage caused by such delay or
failure to the Seller Indemnifying Parties, and then only to the extent
thereof.

 



 

(iii) **_Claim Dispute_**.

 



 

(A) If the Sellers Representative in good faith objects to any claim made by
a Buyer Indemnified Party in any Officers Claim Certificate, then the
Sellers Representative shall deliver a written notice (a " ** _Claim Dispute
Notice_** ") to such Buyer Indemnified Party during the 30-day period
commencing upon receipt by the Sellers Representative of the Officers Claim
Certificate. The Claim Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
principal basis for the dispute of any claim made by such Buyer Indemnified
Party in the Officers Claim Certificate. If the Sellers Representative does
not deliver a Claim Dispute Notice to Buyer prior to the expiration of such
30-day period, then (i) each claim for indemnification set forth in such
Officers Claim Certificate shall be deemed to have been conclusively
determined in Buyers favor for purposes of this **_Section 8.2_** on the
terms set forth in the Officers Claim Certificate, (ii) the amount of such
Loss shall promptly be paid pursuant to **_Section 8.2(d)_**.

 



 

(B) If the Sellers Representative delivers a Claim Dispute Notice, then Buyer
and the Sellers Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
such objections raised by the Sellers Representative in such Claim Dispute
Notice. If Buyer and the Sellers Representative agree to a resolution of such
objection, then a memorandum setting forth the matters conclusively determined
by Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and the amount of such Loss shall promptly be paid pursuant to
**_Section 8.2(d)_**.

 



 

(C) If no such resolution can be reached during the 45-day period following
Buyers receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then upon the expiration of
such 45-day period, either Buyer or the Sellers Representative may bring suit
to resolve the objection in accordance with **_Section 9.10_**. The decision
of the trial court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Officers Claim Certificate shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive
upon Buyer, the Sellers Representative and the Seller Indemnifying Parties. A
judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction pursuant to **_Section 9.10_**.

 



 

(f) **_Third Party Claims_**.

 



 

(i) In the event of the assertion of any claim or the commencement by any
Person of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation
pending by or before any governmental entity (whether against the Company,
against Buyer or against any other Person) with respect to which any of the
Seller Indemnifying Parties may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify,
compensate or reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to **_Section
8.2_** (each, a " ** _Claim_** "), Buyer shall have the right, at its
election, to proceed with the defense of such Claim on its own, including the
right to assert counterclaims, and all reasonable costs associated therewith
shall constitute indemnifiable Losses under **_Section 8.2_** (to the extent
the Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification for such Claim
under this **_Section 8.2_** as ultimately determined by agreement of the
Sellers Representative and such Buyer Indemnified Party or by a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with **_Section 9.10_**). If Buyer so
proceeds with the defense of any such Claim:

 



 

(A) The Sellers Representative and the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall make
available to Buyer any documents and materials in their possession or control
that may be necessary to the defense of such Claim;

 



      
 

 



 

(B) Buyer shall keep the Sellers Representative informed of all material
events and developments, including promptly providing copies of any non-
material, privileged correspondence and court filings, with respect to such
Claim; and

 



 

Buyer shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such action, suit,
proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation without the consent of the
Sellers Representative; **_provided_** , **_however_** , that except with the
consent of the Sellers Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (it being understood and agreed
that the Sellers Representative may only withhold such consent if the
Sellers Representative believes in good faith that there is not any
underlying basis for indemnification with respect to such settlement,
adjustment or compromise), no settlement, adjustment or compromise of any such
Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative or indicative of the
right to indemnification for or the amount of Losses relating to such matter;
**_provided further_** , however, the consent (which may be via e-mail) of the
Sellers Representative with respect to any settlement, adjustment or
compromise of any such Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless the
Sellers Representative shall have objected in writing within fifteen (15)
Business Days after a written request for such consent by a Buyer Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, in
the event that Buyer shall settle, adjust or compromise any Claim that, if
adversely determined, would have given rise to a right of recovery for Losses
and the Sellers Representative shall have unreasonably withheld, delayed or
contested consent to such settlement, adjustment or compromise, subject to the
terms of this 8.2(f), the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover all Losses (including amounts in defense and settlement of such Claim)
with respect to such Claim.

 



 

(ii) In the event that Buyer or another Buyer Indemnified Party becomes aware
of a Claim that Buyer believes may result in a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this **_Section 8.2_** by or on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified
Party, Buyer will promptly notify the Sellers Representative of such Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay in providing such notice prior to the
applicable Survival Date will affect a Buyer Indemnified Partys rights
hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Seller Indemnifying
Parties are materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice must contain a
reasonably detailed description of the basis of the claim and the nature and
amount, if then reasonably ascertainable, of such Losses that may be
indemnifiable.

 



 

(g) **_Purchase Price Adjustment_**. Buyer and the Seller Indemnifying Parties
agree that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable law.

 



 

8.3 **_Release of Escrow Amount_**. Promptly (but no later than ten (10)
Business Days) following the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " ** _Escrow Termination Date_** "), Buyer and Sellers
Representative, by joint written instruction, shall cause the Escrow Agent to
wire to the Seller Indemnifying Parties each Seller Indemnifying Partys
Indemnity Pro Rata Percentage of the positive amount, if any, equal to the
Escrow Amount, as reduced pursuant to the provisions herein, including
**_Section 8.2_**, less an amount equal to a reserve for any claims for which
Buyer has delivered an Officers Claim Certificate that remain outstanding
(provided, that if no amount was specified in such Officers Claim
Certificate, Buyer shall reasonably estimate the amount of any such claim).
After the Escrow Termination Date and upon the resolution of each outstanding
claim, Buyer and the Sellers Representative, by joint written instruction,
shall cause the Escrow Agent to wire the Seller Indemnifying Parties each
Seller Indemnifying Partys Indemnity Pro Rata Percentage of the amount
reserved for such resolved claim, as adjusted pursuant to the provisions
herein, including **_Section 8.2_**, less an amount equal to all amounts
previously distributed to the Seller Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this
**_Section 8.3_** of the remaining Escrow Amount, if any. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the portion of the Escrow Amount to be paid to the Former In-the-
Money Option Holders in respect of their In-the-Money Vested Options who

 



      
 

 



 

are or were employees of the Company shall be distributed to the Company (or
any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto) for payment in accordance with
Section ** _2.3(b)(ii)_**.

 



 

8.4 **_No Contribution_**. The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall not have, or
be entitled to exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any
right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the
Company in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other
liability to which any of them may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement.

 



 

8.5 **_Sellers  Representative_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each Seller Indemnifying Party hereby appoints Shareholder Representative
Services LLC as his, her or its agent, attorney-in-fact and as the Sellers
Representative for and on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties to give
and receive notices and communications, to authorize the reduction of the
Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Buyer Indemnified Party, to
object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and bring suit and comply with orders of courts with respect
to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and bring suit and comply with orders of courts with respect to, any other
claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party against the Company or the Seller
Indemnifying Parties or any dispute between any Buyer Indemnified Party and
any such Seller Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement, including under **_Section 2.5_**.
Such agency may be changed by the Seller Indemnifying Parties from time to
time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Buyer;
**_provided_** _,_ ** _however_** , that the Sellers Representative may not
be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Amount agree
to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. The Sellers
Representative may resign at any time upon not less than thirty (30) days
prior written notice in the event of circumstances rendering it impracticable
for it to continue to effectively serve. A vacancy in the position of Sellers
Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Amount. No bond shall be required of the Sellers Representative. After
the Closing, notices or communications to or from the Sellers Representative
shall constitute notice to or from the Seller Indemnifying Parties.

 



 

(b) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnifying
Party for any act done or omitted hereunder as Sellers Representative while
acting in good faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct (it
being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith). The Seller
Indemnifying Parties shall, severally (in accordance with their Indemnity Pro
Rata Percentage) and not jointly, indemnify the Sellers Representative and
hold the Sellers Representative harmless against any loss, liability, damage,
claim, penalty, fine, forfeiture, action, fee, cost or expense (including the
fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of
document location, duplication and shipment) (" ** _Sellers  Representative
Expenses_**") arising out of or in connection with the Sellers
Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Sellers Representative
Expense is suffered or incurred; **_provided_** , that in the event that any
such Sellers Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of
the Sellers Representative, the Sellers Representative will reimburse the
Seller Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified Sellers
Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct.. If not paid directly to the Sellers
Representative by the Seller Indemnifying Parties, such Sellers
Representative Expenses may be recovered by the Sellers Representative first,
from the Expense Fund, second, from the Escrow Amount at such time as such
remaining amounts are otherwise distributable to the Seller Indemnifying
Parties (and not distributed or distributable to a Buyer Indemnified Parties
or subject to a pending

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification claim of a Buyer Indemnified Party) pursuant to the terms
hereof and of the Escrow Agreement, at the time of distribution, and such
recovery will be made from the Seller Indemnifying Parties according to their
respective Indemnity Pro Rata Percentage; **_provided_** , that while this
section allows the Sellers Representative to be paid from the aforementioned
sources, this does not relieve the Seller Indemnifying Parties from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Sellers Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Sellers
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Seller
Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. The Seller Indemnifying Parties acknowledge
and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or
removal of the Sellers Representative or the termination of this Agreement. A
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative shall
constitute a decision of the Seller Indemnifying Parties and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Seller Indemnifying Parties; and Buyer may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Seller Indemnifying Parties. Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to
any person for any acts done by it in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Paying Agent to, wire to
the Sellers Representative $200,000 (the " ** _Expense Fund Amount_** "). The
Expense Fund Amount shall be held by the Sellers Representative as agent and
for the benefit of the Seller Indemnifying Parties in a segregated client
account and shall be used (i) for the purposes of paying directly or
reimbursing the Sellers Representative for any Sellers Representative
Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
Sellers Representative letter agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by
the Advisory Group (the " ** _Expense Fund_** "). The Seller Indemnifying
Parties will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Sellers Representative any ownership
right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Sellers Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Sellers Representative is not acting as
a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Fund and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations hereunder. As
soon as reasonably determined by the Sellers Representative that the Expense
Fund is no longer required to be withheld, the Sellers Representative shall
cause the remaining Expense Fund (if any) to be distributed to the to the
Paying Agent for further distribution to the Seller Indemnifying Parties in
accordance with their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Percentage.

 



 

(d) The Sellers Representative shall have reasonable access to information
about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the Companys officers and
employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights
hereunder; **_provided_** , **_however_** , that neither Buyer nor the Company
shall be obligated to provide such access or information if it determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would jeopardize the protection of
attorney-client privilege.

 



 

(e) Certain Seller Indemnifying Parties (the " ** _Advisory Group_** ") have
concurrently herewith entered into a letter agreement with Sellers
Representative regarding direction to be provided by the Advisory Group to
Sellers Representative. The Advisory Group shall incur no liability to the
Seller Indemnifying Parties for any liability incurred by the members of the
Advisory Group while acting in good faith and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of their duties (it being understood
that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith), even if such act or omission
constitutes negligence on the part of the Advisory Group or one of its
members. This indemnification and exculpation shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

8.6 **_Mutual Assistance_**. Buyer, the Company, the Sellers Representative
and the Seller Indemnifying Parties agree that they will mutually cooperate in
the expeditious filing of all notices, reports and other filings with any
federal, state, local or foreign governmental authority required to be
submitted jointly by such Persons in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and/or the other agreements contemplated hereby and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

8.7 **_Public Disclosure_**. No party shall issue any statement or
communication to any third party (other than their respective agents that are
bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable,
the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, without the
written consent of Buyer (provided _,_ that Buyer, can determine the timing
and content of any such statement or communication made on or after the date
hereof), except that this restriction shall be subject to Buyer and its
Affiliates obligation to comply with (i) applicable securities laws and the
rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and (ii) disclosures required and/or
requested in dispute resolution proceedings. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
following Closing, the Sellers Representative shall be permitted to: (i)
after the public announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, disclose that it has been engaged to serve as the Sellers
Representative as long as such disclosure does not disclose any of the other
terms of the transactions contemplated herein; and (ii) disclose information
as required by law or to employees, advisors or consultants of the Sellers
Representative and to the Seller Indemnifying Parties, in each case who have a
need to know such information, provided that such persons are subject to
confidentiality obligations with respect thereto.

 



 

8.8 **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Buyer shall
pay all of its fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall pay
all of their and all of the Companys and the Sellers Representatives fees,
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement, the performance of their obligations hereunder and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
party hereto brings an action to enforce its rights under this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
including without limitation reasonable legal fees, incurred in connection
with such action, including any appeal of such action.

 



 

8.9 **_Equitable Remedies_**. Each of the Company, the Seller Indemnifying
Parties, the Sellers Representative and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the Company, the Seller
Indemnifying Parties, the Sellers Representative and Buyer agree that the
other parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action
instituted in any court in the United States or in any state having
jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy
to which they may be entitled pursuant hereto or at law or in equity.

 



 

8.10 **_Further Assurances_**. In the event that at any time after the Closing
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto will take such further action (including
the execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any
other party hereto reasonably may request. Each Seller Indemnifying Party
acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, Buyer will be
entitled to possession of, and each Seller Indemnifying Party shall deliver to
Buyer, all documents, books, records (including Tax records), agreements and
financial data of any sort relating to the Company. In the event that Buyer
reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

determines, in connection with any listing or proposed listing of the
securities of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) on an exchange,
including upon advice of its independent accountants or upon request or
requirement of the Securities and Exchange Commission, that it requires
financial statements (audited or otherwise) for periods prior to the Closing
with respect to the business of the Company, the Seller Indemnifying Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to
prepare any additional financial statements requested by Buyer. Commercially
reasonable efforts in this context shall include, but not be limited to: (i)
providing Buyer and its accountants and other agents access to the books and
records of the Seller Indemnifying Parties (to the extent related to the
business of the Company) and (ii) providing Buyer and its accountants and
other agents access to accountants and employees of the Company to the extent
reasonably required to facilitate preparation and audit of financial
statements. In such event, the cost and expense of preparing and auditing all
such financial statements shall be borne by Buyer.

 



 

8.11 **_Confidentiality_**. Each Seller Indemnifying Party agrees not to
disclose or use at any time (and shall cause each of his Affiliates not to use
or disclose at any time) any Confidential Information. Each Seller
Indemnifying Party further agrees to take all commercially reasonable steps
(and to cause each of his Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable
steps) to safeguard such Confidential Information and to protect it against
disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft. In the event any Seller
Indemnifying Party or any of his Affiliates is required by law, regulation or
legal or judicial process, or dispute resolution process, to disclose any
Confidential Information, such Seller Indemnifying Party shall promptly notify
Buyer in writing, which notification shall include the nature of the
requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and such Seller
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with Buyer and the Company to preserve the
confidentiality of such information consistent with applicable law.

 



 

8.12 **_Tax Matters_**. The following provisions shall govern the allocation
of responsibility as between Buyer and the Seller Indemnifying Parties for
certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " ** _Straddle Period_** "), (i) the amount of any Taxes not
described in clause (ii) below (including franchise Taxes, Taxes that are
based on or measured by income, gross or net sales, payments or receipts,
employment and payroll Taxes or Taxes that are imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property) for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) other than with respect to property placed into
service after the Closing, shall be allocated on a per diem basis, and (ii)
the amount of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal
property Taxes) for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 



 

(b) (i) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or caused to be
filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and Straddle Periods after the Closing Date, but only if not filed on
or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices, unless otherwise required by applicable law or
as otherwise provided in **_Section 8.12(b)(ii)_**. With respect to any such
Tax Return that could reasonably be expected to increase the Seller
Indemnifying Parties indemnification obligations under this Agreement with
respect to Taxes, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the
Sellers Representative for its review and comment not less than fifteen (15)
Business Days (or, in the case of any such Tax Return relating to non-income
Taxes, five (5) Business Days) prior to the date on which such Tax Return is
due

 



      
 

 



 

to be filed (taking into account any applicable extensions), and shall
consider in good faith any changes reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative.

 



 

(i) Buyer and the Seller Indemnifying Parties agree that Buyer shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed an IRS Form 3115
(Application for Change in Accounting Method) to change the Companys overall
method of accounting from the cash receipts and disbursements method to the
accrual method and make an "eligible acquisition transaction election"
described in Section 7.03(3)(d) of Rev. Proc. 2015-13, 2015-5 IRB 419, in each
case, with the Tax Returns filed for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the
Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Buyer, the Company and each Seller Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
**_Section 8.12_** and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer and each
Seller Indemnifying Party further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby). Except to the extent required by
applicable law, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause the Company to amend any
previously filed Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, file Tax Returns
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction where the Company has not
historically filed Tax Returns, or make or change any Tax election that has
any retroactive effect on any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company, in each
case, without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
such election would not create or increase the Seller Indemnifying Parties
indemnification obligations under this Agreement with respect to Taxes.

 



 

(d) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after
the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

 



 

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) (" ** _Transfer Taxes_** ") incurred in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Seller Indemnifying
Parties and such portion shall be Transaction Expenses, and shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. The party that is legally required to file a Tax
Return relating to Transfer Taxes shall be responsible for preparing and
timely filing such Tax Return.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall promptly give written notice to the Sellers Representative of
the receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company after the
Closing Date) of notice of any audit, claim, inquiry, examination or other
proceeding relating to Taxes (a " ** _Tax Claim_** ") attributable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period with respect to which Buyer intends to seek indemnification
under **_Article VIII_**. The Sellers Representative shall control all
proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the
Company for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and may
make all decisions in connection with such Tax Claim, provided, however, that
(i) Buyer and counsel of its own choosing shall have the right to participate
fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim, (ii) the
Sellers Representative shall keep Buyer reasonably informed, and consult in
good faith with Buyer, with respect to the status and progress of such Tax
Claim, and (iii) the Sellers Representative shall not settle any such Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer, which

 



      
 

 



 

consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Buyer
shall control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating
to Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period and may make all decisions in
connection with such Tax Claim, provided, however, that and the Buyer shall
not settle any such Tax Claim without the written consent of the Sellers
Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Notwithstanding anything in **_Article VIII_** to the contrary,
this **_Section 8.12(f)_**, and not **_Section 8.2(f)_** shall govern the
conduct of Tax Claims.

 



 

(g) Any refunds (or credits for overpayment) of Taxes, including any interest
received from a taxing authority thereon but net of any Taxes or reasonable
costs incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, attributable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the Company shall be for the account of the Seller
Indemnifying Parties to the extent such refunds or credits are received prior
to the Fundamental Rep Survival Date; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such refunds or credits shall be for the account of Buyer to
the extent such refunds or credits are attributable to the carryback from a
taxable period (or a portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of
items of loss, deduction or credit, or other Tax items of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and the Company. Promptly upon the Companys (or any of
its Affiliates) receipt of any such refund (or credit for overpayment) to
which the Sellers are entitled pursuant to the foregoing sentence, Buyer shall
pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any
such refund (or the amount of any such credit), including any interest
received from a taxing authority thereon but net of any Taxes or reasonable
costs incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, to the Paying Agent, for
distribution to the Sellers based on each Seller Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata
Percentage of such amounts. The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall pay over, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any such refunds
(or the amount of any such credit), including any interest received relating
thereto, to Buyer promptly upon the Buyers request if the Buyer is required
to repay such refunds or credits to a taxing authority.

 



 

8.13 **_Release of Claims_** **.**

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, each Seller Indemnified Party (on such Seller
Indemnified Partys own behalf and on behalf of his, her or its Affiliates)
hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and completely releases, acquits and
forever discharges Buyer, the Company (and the parents, successors and past,
present and future assigns, directors, officers, agents, attorneys and
representatives of the foregoing respective entities) (the " ** _Releasees_**
") from any past, present and future disputes, claims, controversies, demands,
rights, obligations, liabilities, actions and causes of action of every kind
and nature involving, or that may be asserted by, the Seller Indemnified Party
or any of the Seller Indemnified Partys Affiliates may have had in the past,
may now have or may have in the future against any of the Releasees, directly
or indirectly relating to or directly or indirectly arising out of: (i) any
written or oral agreement entered into by the Seller Indemnified Party with
the Company, arrangement or plan of the Company occurring, existing, entered
into or adopted by or in favor of the Seller Indemnified Party or any of the
Seller Indemnified Partys Affiliates at any time up to and including the date
of the Closing; or (ii) any event, matter, cause, thing, act, omission or
conduct occurring or existing at any time up to and including the date of this
letter agreement, including, without limitation, any claim arising (directly
or indirectly) out of or in any way connected with any employment or other
relationship of the Seller Indemnified Party or any of the Seller Indemnified
Partys Affiliates with (I) any of the Releasees; _provided, however_ , that
the Seller Indemnified Party is not releasing any rights available to the
Seller Indemnified Party to any rights to payment under this Agreement or any
other agreement entered into by the Seller Indemnified Party with the Company
in connection with the Closing, (II) any entitlement to salary, bonuses, other
compensation or employment benefits under any other Material Contract
appearing on the Disclosure Schedule earned or accrued by or for the benefit
of any of the Seller Indemnifying Parties prior to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in respect of services performed
by any of the Seller Indemnifying Parties as a director,

 



      
 

 



 

officer, or employee of the Company; and (III) any right to exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses from the Company pursuant to (w)
the terms of any indemnification agreement between the Seller Indemnifying
Parties and the Company, (x) the organizational documents of the Company, (y)
applicable law or (z) the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Seller Indemnified Party (on the Seller Indemnified Partys own behalf
and on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Partys Affiliates) hereby waives the
benefits of, and any rights that the Seller Indemnified Party or any of the
Seller Indemnified Partys Affiliates may have under, any statute or common
law regarding the release of unknown claims in any jurisdiction. The Seller
Indemnified Party acknowledges that the Seller Indemnified Party has read
Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California that provides as
follows:

 



 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 



 

The Seller Indemnified Party waives any right or benefit that the Seller
Indemnified Party has or may have under Section 1542 of the Civil Code, any
similar law of any other jurisdiction, or any common law principles of similar
effect, to the full extent that the Seller Indemnified Party may lawfully
waive all such rights and benefits pertaining to the subject matter of this
letter agreement. The Seller Indemnified Party acknowledges that the Seller
Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified Partys representatives may
hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to or different from those that
the Seller Indemnified Party now knows or believes to exist with respect to
the subject matter of this letter agreement, but that it is the Seller
Indemnified Partys intention in executing this letter agreement to fully,
finally and forever settle and release all of the matters released herein. In
furtherance of this intention, the release herein granted shall be and remain
in effect notwithstanding the discovery of any such additional or different
claim or fact.

 



 

(c) The Seller Indemnified Party: (i) represents and warrants that the Seller
Indemnified Party has taken all actions necessary or appropriate to give full
effect to the release given by the Seller Indemnified Party (on the Seller
Indemnified Partys own behalf and on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Partys
Affiliates) in this **_Section 8.13_** and (ii) agrees that the Seller
Indemnified Party shall execute and deliver (and cause the Seller Indemnified
Partys Affiliates to execute and deliver) to the Company and the other
Releasees such instruments and other documents, and shall take (and cause the
Seller Indemnified Partys Affiliates to take) such other actions, as the
Company may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing
the release given by the Seller Indemnified Party (on the Seller Indemnified
Partys own behalf and on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Partys Affiliates)
in this **_Section 8.13_**. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Seller Indemnified Party: (a) agrees that the Seller Indemnified Party
will not assert or attempt to assert, and will ensure that none of the Seller
Indemnified Partys Affiliates will assert or attempt to assert, any claim of
the type described in **_Section 8.13(a)_** against any Releasee at any time
after the execution and delivery of this letter agreement; (b) represents,
warrants and covenants that the Seller Indemnified Party has not assigned and
will not assign to any other person or entity any claim of the type described
in **_Section 8.13(a)_**; and (c) agrees and undertakes not to encourage or
instigate any claims by other persons or entities against the Releases in
connection with any claim of the type described in **_Section 8.13(a)_**.

9.3 **_Successors and Assigns_**. This Agreement and all of the covenants and
agreements contained herein and rights, interests or obligations hereunder, by
or on behalf of any of the parties hereto, shall bind and inure to the benefit
of the respective heirs, successors and assigns of the parties hereto whether
so expressed or not, except that neither this Agreement nor any of the
covenants and agreements herein or rights, interests or obligations hereunder
may be assigned or delegated by the Seller Indemnifying Parties prior to or
after the Closing, or assigned or delegated by the Company prior to the
Closing, without the prior written consent of Buyer. Buyer may assign its
rights and obligations hereunder (including Buyers right to purchase the

Closing, the Company may assign any or all of its rights pursuant to this
Agreement to any of their respective lenders as collateral security.

 



 

9.4 **_Severability_**. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

9.5 **_Interpretation_**. The headings and captions used in this Agreement, in
any Schedule or Exhibit hereto, in the table of contents or in any index
hereto are for convenience of reference only and

 



      
 

 



 

do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit,
characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement or any
Schedule or Exhibit hereto, and all provisions of this Agreement and the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto shall be enforced and construed as if no caption
or heading had been used herein or therein. Any capitalized terms used in any
Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meanings set forth in this Agreement. Each defined term used in this
Agreement shall have a comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular
form. The use of the word "including" (or definitions thereof) herein shall
mean "including without limitation" and, unless the context otherwise
required, "neither," "nor," "any," "either" and "or" shall not be exclusive.
The parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty and covenant
contained herein shall have independent significance. If any party has
breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which such party has not breached shall not detract
from or mitigate the fact that such party is in breach of the first
representation, warranty or covenant. The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

9.6 **_No Third-Party Beneficiaries_**. Nothing herein expressed or implied is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (other
than the parties hereto, the Former In-the-Money Option Holders, the DandO
Indemnified Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns),
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, such third
parties specifically including employees and creditors of the Company.

 



 

9.7 **_Complete Agreement_**. This Agreement and the agreements and documents
referred to herein contain the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings whether written or oral, relating to such
subject matter in any way.

 



 

9.8 **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 



 

9.9 **_Electronic Delivery_**. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
Internet mail in portable document format or similar format (any such
delivery, an " ** _Electronic Delivery_** "), shall be treated in all manner
and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall re execute
original forms thereof and deliver them (by means other than Electronic
Delivery) to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise (a) the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a
signature or (b) the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense related to lack of
authenticity.

 



 

9.10 **_Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_**.

 



 

(a) The internal law (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of New York

 **ESCROW AGREEMENT**

      
 

 



 

 ** _EXECUTION COPY_**

 



 

 _ESCROW AGREEMENT_

 



 

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
July , 2016, by and among Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a
Colorado limited liability company solely in its capacity as the Sellers
Representative (the " _Sellers  Representative_"), Penn Interactive Ventures,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Buyer_ " and, together with
the Sellers Representative, sometimes referred to individually as a " _Party_
" and collectively as the " _Parties_ "), and Citibank, National Association,
as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). Capitalized terms not defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Purchase Agreement, as defined
below.

 



 

 _RECITALS_

 



 

A. Rocket Games, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), each of the
persons listed as "Sellers" on the signature pages thereto, the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer have entered into that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated as of July , 2016 (as amended from time to time, the "
_Purchase Agreement_ "), which provides that a portion of the consideration
otherwise payable by the Buyer shall be placed in escrow by the Buyer as
partial security for the indemnification obligations set forth in the Purchase
Agreement.

 



 

B. At the Buyers instruction, the Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company
as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") agrees to deposit in escrow a
cash amount equal to Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) (the " _Escrow Amount_
"), and the Escrow Agent agrees to hold and distribute such funds in
accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and this Escrow Agreement.

 



 

In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants hereinafter set
forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Appointment_. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to act as escrow agent in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



 

2. _Escrow Fund_. Promptly following the Closing (but no later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date), the Paying Agent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") in immediately available funds. The Escrow Agent shall acknowledge receipt of the Escrow Fund in a separate and distinct account (the " _Escrow Account_ "), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

3. _Investment of the Escrow Fund_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Parties, the Escrow Agent
shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Fund in a "noninterest-bearing deposit
account" insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" _FDIC_ ") to
the applicable limits. The Escrow Fund shall at all times remain available for
distribution in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Agent shall send an account statement to each of the Parties on
a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Escrow Account for the preceding
month. The Escrow Agent shall also maintain for each Seller Indemnifying Party
a spreadsheet accounting record (each Seller Indemnifying Partys " _Account_
") specifying the portion of the Escrow Fund held for the record of each
Seller Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement. All Escrow Fund received
under this Agreement will be allocated to each Seller Indemnifying Partys
Account in accordance with such Seller Indemnifying Partys Indemnity Pro Rata
Percentage of the Escrow Fund, as set forth on the Securityholders Schedule.

Agent shall promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days after
receipt of a Joint Release Instruction, disburse all or the applicable part of
the Escrow Fund in accordance with such Joint Release Instruction.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4(a)(i), if at any
time either of the Parties receives a Final Determination (as defined herein),
then upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a copy of such Final Determination
from any Party, the Escrow Agent shall (A) promptly deliver a copy of such
Final Determination to each other Party and (B) on the Business Day following
receipt by the applicable Party from the Escrow Agent of the copy of such
Final Determination, disburse as directed, part or all, as the case may be, of
the Escrow Fund (only to the extent funds are available in the Escrow Fund) in
accordance with such Final Determination. Subject to the terms of this Section
4(a), the Escrow Agent will act on such Final Determination without further
inquiry.

 



 

(iv) All payments of any part of the Escrow Fund made in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds or cashiers check as set forth in the Joint Release Instruction or
Final Determination, if and as applicable.

 



 

(v) In the event a Joint Release Instruction is delivered to the Escrow Agent,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instruction by
telephone call back to the person or persons designated in _Exhibits A-1_ and
or _A-2_ annexed hereto (the " _Call Back Authorized Individuals_ "), and the
Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting to be a Call
Back Authorized Individual. To assure accuracy of the instructions it
receives, the Escrow Agent may record such call backs. If the Escrow Agent is
unable to verify the instructions, or is not satisfied with the verification
it receives, it will not execute the instruction until all such issues have
been resolved. The persons and telephone numbers for call backs may be changed
only in writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(vi) Neither the Escrow Fund nor any beneficial interest in the Escrow Fund
may be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation of law,

equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of a Seller
Indemnifying Party, prior to the delivery to such Seller Indemnifying Party of
such Sellers Indemnifying Partys Indemnity Pro Rata Percentage of the Escrow
Fund by the Escrow Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Certain Definitions_.

day on which banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in San

5. _Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation the Purchase Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any Person has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any Joint Release Instruction furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed and presented by the proper Party or Parties. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers forms in the form of _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ attached hereto. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Escrow Fund. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in a Joint Release Instruction or a Final Determination. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable, directly or indirectly, for any (a) damages, losses or expenses arising out of the services provided hereunder, other than damages, losses or expenses which result from the Escrow Agents fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (b) special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

 



 

6. _Resignation and Removal of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent (a) may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) calendar days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the Parties specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect or (b) may be removed, with or without cause, by a Buyer Indemnified Party and the Sellers Representative acting jointly at any time by providing written notice to the Escrow Agent. Any corporation or 

 



      
 

 



 

association into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all
or substantially all of the escrow business of the Escrow Agents line of
business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement
without further act. The Escrow Agents sole responsibility after such thirty
(30) day notice period expires or after receipt of written notice of removal
shall be to hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund (without any obligation to
reinvest the same) and to deliver the same (i) to a substitute or successor
escrow agent pursuant to a joint written designation from the Parties, (ii) as
set forth in a Joint Release Instruction or (iii) in accordance with the
directions of a Final Determination, at which time of delivery Escrow Agents
obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. In the event the Escrow Agent
resigns, if the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent prior
to the expiration of thirty (30) calendar days following their receipt of the
notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of such a successor escrow agent or for other
appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon
all of the Parties hereto.

 



 

7. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent are described in _Schedule 1_ attached hereto and shall be paid by the Buyer. The fees agreed upon for the services to be rendered hereunder are intended as full compensation for the Escrow Agent services as contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that the conditions for the disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled, or the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or there is any assignment of interest in the subject matter of the Escrow Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a party to any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Agreement or the subject matter hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay, controversy, litigation or event.

 



 

8. _Indemnity_. Each of the Buyer and the Sellers Representative (solely on behalf of the Sellers and in its capacity as the Sellers Representative, not in its individual capacity) shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents and employees (the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of one outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively " _Escrow Agent Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with (a) the Escrow Agents execution and performance of this Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the Indemnitee, except to the extent that such Escrow Agent Losses have been caused by the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent or any such Indemnitee, or (b) its following any instructions or other directions from the Sellers Representative or the Buyer, except to the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. The Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement. The Parties hereby grant the Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-off against and security interest in, the Escrow Fund for the payment of any reasonable claim for indemnification, expenses and amounts due hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Escrow Agent is expressly authorized and directed, but shall not be obligated, upon prior written notice to the Parties, to charge against and withdraw from the Escrow Fund for its own account or for the account of an indemnitee any amounts due to the Escrow Agent or to an indemnitee under this _Section 8_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative agree, solely as between themselves, that any obligation for indemnification under this _Section 8_ (or for reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent described in _Section 7_) shall be borne by the party or parties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be responsible for causing the loss, damage, liability, 

 



      
 

 



 

cost or expense against which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification
or, if no such determination is made, then one-half by the Buyer and one-half
by the Sellers Representative (solely on behalf of the Sellers). The
provisions of this _Section 8_ shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes, until
the distribution of the Escrow Fund (or portions thereof) is determined, that

(b) The Escrow Agent shall be responsible for income reporting to the IRS with
respect to interest or other income earned on the Escrow Fund. The Escrow

* Neither the execution and delivery of this Letter of Transmittal nor the agreements or other actions contemplated hereby will (a) materially violate, be in material conflict with, or constitute a material default (or an event, which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default) under any agreement or commitment to which the undersigned is a party or (b) violate any statute or law or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any court or other governmental authority applicable to the undersigned.

Transmittal (and/or other additional documentation as described herein) is

Transmittal, duly completed and executed, must be used in connection with the
delivery and surrender of the Certificate(s). A Letter of Transmittal and the
Certificate(s) must be received by the Paying Agent, in satisfactory form, in
order to make an effective surrender. Delivery of the Certificate(s) and other
documents shall be effected, and the risk of loss and title to the
Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate(s) to
the Paying Agent. The method of delivery of the Certificate(s) and other
documents is at the election and risk of the Seller. If such delivery is by
mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is
recommended. Surrender may be made by mail, by hand or by overnight courier to

stock powers and signature guarantees are unnecessary unless (a) the
Certificate(s) is (are) registered in a name other than that of the person

whatsoever. If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are registered in

registrations of Certificates. If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are
held of record by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this

Transmittal is inadequate, the Certificate numbers and number of Shares should
be listed on a separate signed schedule affixed hereto.

 



 

 **10** **. Letter of Transmittal Required; Surrender of Certificate(s); Lost
Certificate(s). **You will not receive any cash for your Shares unless and
until you deliver this Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and signed, to
the Paying Agent, together with the Certificate(s) representing such Shares
and any required accompanying evidences of authority in form satisfactory to
the Paying Agent. If the Certificate(s) has (have) been lost or destroyed,
such fact should be indicated on the face of this Letter of Transmittal. In
such event, the Paying Agent will forward additional documentation and
instructions necessary to be completed in order to effectively surrender the

 **11** **. Form W-9.** Each Seller surrendering Shares for payment is
required to provide the Paying Agent with a correct Taxpayer Identification
Number and certain other information on an IRS Form W-9 or an appropriate IRS
Form W-8, as described below.

      
 

 



 

 ** _IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION_**

 



 

Under United States federal income tax laws, a holder who receives cash
payments pursuant to the Acquisition is required to provide the Paying Agent
(as payer) with such holders correct TIN on the Form W9 below (or otherwise
establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding) and certify under
penalty of perjury that such Tax Identification Number (" **TIN** ") is
correct and that such holder is not subject to backup withholding. If such
holder is an individual, the TIN is his or her social security number. In the
case of an entity, the correct TIN is the holders Employer Identification
Number. If the Paying Agent is not provided with the correct TIN or an
adequate basis for an exemption, a penalty may be imposed by the Internal
Revenue Service (" **IRS** "), and the payment of any cash pursuant to the
Acquisition may be subject to backup withholding.

 



 

Certain holders (including, among others, all corporations and foreign
individuals and entities) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. Exempt holders should indicate their exempt status on
Form W9. In order for a foreign individual or foreign entity to qualify as
exempt from backup withholding, such individual or entity must submit an
appropriate and properly completed Form W8 BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP or W-8IMY, as
the case may be, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to such exempt
status. Such forms and instructions may be obtained from the IRS at its
Internet website: www.irs.gov.

 



 

If backup withholding applies, the Paying Agent is required to withhold at a
rate not to exceed 28% of any payments made to the holder or other payee.
Amounts withheld, if any, under backup withholding rules are generally not an
additional tax and may be refunded or credited against a holders federal
income tax liability, provided that the holder timely furnishes the required
information to the IRS.

 



 

 **Purpose of Form W9**

 



 

To prevent backup withholding on payments made with respect to Certificate(s),
the holder is required to notify the Paying Agent of such holders correct TIN
by completing the Form W-9 below, certifying that (1) the TIN provided on the
Form W9 is correct (or that such holder is awaiting a TIN), (2) such holder
is not subject to backup withholding because (a) such holder is exempt from
backup withholding, (b) such holder has not been notified by the IRS that such
holder is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all
interest or dividends or (c) the IRS has notified such holder that such holder
is no longer subject to backup withholding and (3) such holder is a U.S.
person (including a U.S. resident alien).

 



 

 **What Number to Give the Paying Agent**

 



 

The holder is required to give the Paying Agent the TIN (i.e., social security
number or employer identification number) of the holder of the Certificate(s)
tendered hereby. If the Certificate(s) are held in more than one name or are
not held in the name of the actual owner, consult the instructions following
the Form W9 for additional guidance on which number to report.

[Address]

 



 

Dear [Name]:

 



 

Congratulations!

 



 

In connection with the sale (the "Transaction") of Rocket Games, Inc. (the
"Company") to Penn Interactive Ventures, LLC, I am proud to extend you an
offer to retain your position with the Company as [Title]. In that position,
you will be expected to retain your current duties and responsibilities. This
offer letter will become effective upon, and is subject to, the closing of the
Transaction (the "Closing"), should you choose to accept employment with the
Company after the Closing. We ask that you review and sign the enclosed
document as a Closing document.

 



 

Provided that all contingencies are met and you accept this offer, the
employment terms and conditions in this offer letter will start to apply to
you as of the day after the Closing (the "Start Date").

 



 

Your annual base salary will initially be $[Amount], which will be paid every
other week, less payroll deductions and all required withholdings.

 



 

In addition, during the period you are employed with the Company, you will be
eligible to earn a discretionary cash bonus of up to 30% of your base salary
("Target Amount"), subject to review and adjustment by the Company in its sole
discretion, payable subject to standard federal and state payroll withholding
requirements. Whether or not you earn any bonus will be dependent upon (a)
your continuous performance of services to the Company through the date any
bonus is paid; and (b) the actual achievement by you and the Company of the
applicable performance targets and goals set by the Company. The Company will
determine in its sole discretion the extent to which you and the Company have
achieved the performance goals upon which the bonus is based and the amount of
the bonus. The bonus shall be subject to the terms of the applicable incentive
compensation plan that will be adopted by the Company after the Closing and
shall be in lieu of (and not in addition to) any other bonus or incentive
program to which you were entitled prior to the Closing. Any bonus, if earned,
will be paid to you within the time period set forth in the incentive
compensation plan, or if no such time period was established, within two and
one-half months following the end of the year during which the bonus is
earned.

 



 

Currently, the Company intends to maintain the same benefit plans after the
Closing and you will continue to be eligible to participate in such benefit
plans on the same basis as similarly situated employees.

      
 

 



 

The Company reserves the right to modify your compensation, benefits, job
title, duties and reporting relationship to meet business needs. The Company
may change its compensation and benefit plans or practices from time to time
in accordance with applicable laws. You will be subject to all applicable
employment and other policies of the Company, as established or modified by
the Company from time to time.

 



 

This offer is contingent upon you: 1) signing the Companys Employee
Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement and Agreement to Arbitrate
Claims (a copy of which is enclosed); 2) timely providing the Company with
appropriate documents establishing your identity and right to work in the
United States; and (3) signing the enclosed Employment Agreement.

 



 

This letter, along with the Employment Agreement and the Employee Proprietary
Information and Inventions Agreement and Agreement to Arbitrate Claims
referred to above, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company
regarding the terms and conditions of your employment as of the Start Date. It
supersedes all negotiations, representations or agreements, whether prior or
contemporaneous, written or oral, between you and the Company on this subject,
including but not limited to any prior contractor or consulting agreement you
entered into with the Company.

 



 

We are excited about working with you and having you as part of our team. If
you have any questions regarding this offer, please reach out to me directly
by way of phone or email at [ ].

 



 

If acceptable, please countersign and date this letter in the space provided
below and return the original of this letter to me by way of email no later
than [Date].

 ** _EXHIBIT E_**

 



 

 **FORM OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT**

      
 

 



 

 **RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT**

 



 

This **RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT** (this " **Agreement** ") is entered
into as of , 2016, and effective as of the Closing Date, by and
between , in his or her, as applicable, capacity as an
equityholder of the Company (" **Equityholder** "), and Penn Interactive
Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" **Buyer** ") in favor
of, and for the benefit of: Rocket Games, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
**Company** "); and any other Buyer Indemnified Party (as the term is defined
in the Stock Purchase Agreement to which this Agreement is an exhibit). Each
of Buyer and Equityholder are a " **Party** ," and collectively, they are the
" **Parties**." Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined
in Section 17 below.

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

A. This Agreement is being entered into pursuant to and as a condition of that
certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the " **SPA** "), dated as of the date
hereof, by and among Buyer, the Company, Sellers (as the term is defined in
the SPA) and Sellers Representative (as the term is defined in the SPA),
pursuant to which Buyer shall acquire all of the Shares (as the term is
defined in the SPA) and its goodwill and in exchange the holders of Shares
will receive cash consideration on the terms provided in the SPA.

 



 

B. Equityholder owns certain Shares and acknowledges and agrees that, by
virtue of the Share Sale (as the term is defined in the SPA), Equityholder is
selling or disposing of all of Equityholders ownership interest in the
Company and selling the goodwill of the Company Business associated with
Equityholders Shares to Buyer and will directly benefit from Buyers
acquisition of such goodwill.

 



 

C. Upon and after the Share Sale, Buyer shall carry on the Company Business;
therefore, Equityholder has agreed that it is fair and appropriate to preserve
the value of the goodwill of the Company to be purchased by Buyer by entering
into this Agreement, which ensures that Equityholder will not compete with the
Company or Buyer as set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

D. Equityholder acknowledges that the agreements and covenants provided by
Equityholder in this Agreement are essential to protect the value of the
Company Business, including, without limitation, the goodwill associated with
the Company Business, and such covenants and agreements contained herein are a
material inducement to Buyers agreement to enter into and consummate the
Share Sale pursuant to the SPA.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, including, without
limitation, for Buyer to enter into the SPA and to consummate the Share Sale
contemplated thereby and in consideration of the promises and the
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, Equityholder
hereby covenants and agrees to the following terms and conditions which
Equityholder acknowledges and agrees are reasonably designed to protect the
legitimate business interests of Buyer:

 



 

1. _Non-Competition Restriction_. Equityholder agrees that, during the Restricted Period, except on behalf of Buyer and its Affiliates, Equityholder shall not, and shall not permit any Affiliate of Equityholder, to:

 



 

(a) engage directly or indirectly in Competition in any Restricted Territory;
or

 



 

(b) be or become an officer, director, stockholder, sole proprietor, owner,
partner, member, investor, or otherwise acquire or hold (of record,
beneficially or otherwise) any direct or indirect interest in, any Person that
engages directly or indirectly in Competition in any Restricted

      
 

 



 

Territory; _provided, however,_ that Equityholder may, without violating this
Section 1(b), own, as a passive investment, shares of capital stock of a
publicly-held corporation that engages in Competition if (i) such shares are
actively traded on an established national securities market in the United
States, (ii) the number of shares of such corporations capital stock that are
owned beneficially (directly or indirectly) by Equityholder and the number of
shares of such corporations capital stock that are owned beneficially
(directly or indirectly) by Equityholders Affiliates collectively represent
less than one percent (1%) of the total number of shares of such corporations
capital stock outstanding, and (iii) neither Equityholder nor any Affiliate of
Equityholder is otherwise associated directly or indirectly with such
corporation or with any Affiliate of such corporation.

 



 

2. _Non-Solicitation of Customers or Other Business Relations_. During the Restricted Period, Equityholder shall not, and shall not permit any Affiliate of Equityholder, to: (a) solicit, induce or attempt to induce any Person who, within the 365-day period ending on the Closing Date, was a Customer, supplier, licensee, consultant or other business associate of the Company (i) for any purpose except on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, (ii) to cease doing business with any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or (iii) to diminish or materially alter, in a manner harmful to any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, said Persons relationship with any such Buyer Indemnified Parties; or (b) assist any other Person to engage in the activities prohibited by clause (a) of this sentence.

 



 

3. _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. Equityholder agrees that, during the Restricted Period, Equityholder shall not, and shall not permit any of his or her, as applicable, Affiliates to: (a) solicit, induce or attempt to induce any Specified Employee (i) to leave his or her employment with any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or (ii) to diminish or materially alter, in a manner harmful to any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, said Specified Employees relationship with any such Buyer Indemnified Parties; or (b) assist any other Person to engage in the activities prohibited by clause (a) of this sentence.

 



 

4. _Reasonable Restraint_. Equityholder acknowledges, in connection with the activities prohibited by the restrictions herein, that: (i) the relevant market for the technology and products being developed by the Company is worldwide and, thus, the covenants in Sections 1 through 3 impose a reasonable restraint in light of the activities, businesses and plans of Buyer; (ii) it is the intention of the Parties that the entire goodwill of the Company be transferred to Buyer and its Affiliates as part of the Share Sale contemplated by the SPA, including the goodwill existing between the Company, on the one hand, and its Customers, suppliers, licensees, employees, consultants, and other Persons under contract or otherwise associated or doing business with the Company, on the other hand; (iii) the Parties explicitly considered the value of the goodwill to be transferred from Equityholder by virtue of the Share Sale and that such goodwill is valued as a component of the consideration to be paid by Buyer pursuant to the terms of the SPA; and (iv) the covenants set forth in Sections 1 through 3 are a material and substantial part of the Share Sale contemplated by the SPA (supported by adequate consideration), and Buyers and its Affiliates failure to receive the entire goodwill contemplated by the SPA would have the effect of significantly reducing the value of the Company and the Shares to Buyer.

 



 

5. _Separate Covenants_. The covenants contained herein shall be construed as if each covenant is divided into separate and distinct covenants with respect to each capacity in which Equityholder is prohibited from competing and each part of the Restricted Territory. Each such covenant shall constitute separate and several covenants distinct from all other such covenants. In addition, in the event any covenant or other provision contained herein shall be deemed to be illegal, unenforceable or unreasonable by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to any part of the Restricted Territory, such covenant or provision shall not be affected with respect to any and all other parts of the Restricted Territory, and each of the Parties agrees and submits to the reduction of said territorial restriction to such an area as said court shall deem reasonable. Similarly, in the event any covenant or other provision contained herein shall be deemed to be illegal, unenforceable or unreasonable

 



      
 

 



 

by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to the
Restricted Period, each of the Parties hereto agrees and submits to the
shortest reduction of the Restricted Period to such a time period as said
court shall deem reasonable.

 



 

6. _Representations and Remedies_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that: (i) Equityholder is deriving substantial economic benefit from the sale or disposition of Equityholders Shares in connection with the Share Sale; (ii) the covenants and the restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary, fundamental and required for the protection of Buyers interest in the Company; (iii) such covenants relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character that gives each of such covenants a special, unique and extraordinary value; (iv) Equityholder is entering into this Agreement solely in connection with the sale or disposition of Equityholders Shares and not in connection with any contemplated employment with Buyer or its Affiliates; and (v) a breach of any of such covenants or any other provision of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm and damage to Buyer that cannot be adequately compensated by a monetary award. Accordingly, it is expressly agreed that, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity (including, without limitation, money damages from Equityholder), Buyer shall be entitled to seek the remedy of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or such other form of injunctive or equitable relief as may be used by any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin Equityholder from breaching any such covenant or provision or to specifically enforce the provisions hereof.

 



 

7. _Independence of Obligations_. Equityholders obligations under this Agreement are absolute and shall not be terminated or otherwise limited by virtue of any breach (on the part of Buyer, any other Buyer Indemnified Party or any other Person) of any provision of the SPA or any other agreement, or by virtue of any failure to perform or other breach of any obligation of Buyer, any other Buyer Indemnified Party or any other Person. In addition, the covenants and obligations of Equityholder set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other agreement or arrangement between Equityholder, on the one hand, and Buyer or its Affiliates, on the other hand, and except as otherwise required by law, the existence of any claim or cause of action by Equityholder against Buyer shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants or obligations against Equityholder.

 



 

8. _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure or any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other Party; (ii) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (iii) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications which are required or may be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally or by commercial messenger or courier service, or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), except that notices sent by mail will not be deemed given until received, or sent via electronic mail (with acknowledgment of delivery), to the addresses specified on the signature page of this Agreement or to such other addresses as any Party may specify by notice in writing to the other.

 



      
 

 



 

10. _Successors and Assigns_. Each of Buyer, the Company and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties may freely assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement, at any time, in whole or in part, to any Person without obtaining the consent or approval of Equityholder or of any other Person. This Agreement shall be binding upon Equityholder and his or her, as applicable, heirs, executors, estate, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of Buyer, the Company and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties.

 



 

11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

12. _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to Section 13, each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within San Francisco, California, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of California and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. Subject to Section 13, each Party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except in such courts.

 



 

13. _Mandatory Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) Any and all disputes, claims, or controversies between the Parties
(specifically including, but not being limited to, any assignee of a Party)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the breach thereof,
that are not resolved by their mutual agreement shall be submitted to final
and binding arbitration before JAMS, or its successor, at JAMS office in San
Francisco, California, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec.
1, _et seq_. The dispute shall be submitted to one arbitrator, who shall have
sole authority to determine procedural questions, such as arbitrability,
standing, and real party in interest, as well as the merits of the claim.

 



 

(b) Any Party may commence the arbitration process by filing a written demand
for arbitration with JAMS and concurrently sending a copy to the other Party
or Parties. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as in
effect when the demand is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, depositions
may be taken and other discovery obtained during such arbitration proceedings
to the same extent as authorized in civil judicial proceedings in the State of
California. The parties to the dispute, claim, or controversy will cooperate
with JAMS and each other in selecting an arbitrator from JAMS panel of
neutrals and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings. The costs and fees of
JAMS and of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties to the
dispute, claim or controversy. The provisions of this Section 13 are
specifically enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) The Parties may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary
restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim, injunctive,
declaratory, or equitable relief, as necessary, without breach of this Section
13 and without abridgement of the powers of the arbitrator.

 



 

(d) By agreeing to binding arbitration as provided herein, each of the Parties
waives

 



      
 

 



 

his/her/its right to have any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement decided in court by a judge or jury.

 



 

14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and any Party may execute any such counterpart, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts taken together shall have been executed and delivered by the Parties by facsimile transmission, PDF or otherwise.

 



 

15. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement is entered into concurrently with the SPA, and together with the provisions therein on the same subject, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior written and oral agreements and understandings between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by all Parties.

 



 

16. _Advice of Counsel_. Each Party acknowledges that it, he or she, as applicable, has either been represented by independent legal counsel or has waived said Partys right to obtain advice of legal counsel in connection with the Share Sale and the restrictions contemplated by this Agreement.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

This Letter of Transmittal relates to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as
of July ** ** , 2016 (the " **Stock Purchase Agreement** "), by and among
Penn Interactive Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
**Buyer** "), Rocket Games, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " **Company**
"), each of the persons listed as "Sellers" on the signature pages thereto
(each, a " **Seller** " and together, the " **Sellers** "), and Shareholder
Representative Services LLC ** _,_** as Sellers Representative (the "
**Sellers  Representative**"), pursuant to which Buyer purchased all the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company from the Sellers (the "
**Acquisition** "). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

 



 

In connection with the Acquisition, the undersigned herewith surrenders the
above-described In-the-Money Vested Options to be exchanged for cash, as
provided under the Stock Purchase Agreement, minus any withholdings, payable
pursuant to the Acquisition, as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

 



 

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants as follows:

 



 

 ***** The undersigned is the record and beneficial owner of the In-the-Money
Vested Option(s) listed on this Letter of Transmittal, and has full power and
authority to surrender the In-the-Money Vested Options, free and clear of all
liens, restrictions, claims, charges and encumbrances, and the same are not
subject to any adverse claims.

 



 

 ***** Other than the In-the-Money Vested Options listed on this Letter of
Transmittal, the undersigned owns no other In-the-Money Vested Options.

 



 

 ***** The undersigned has full power and authority to execute and deliver
this Letter of Transmittal and to perform his, her or its obligations
hereunder.

 



 

 ***** This Letter of Transmittal constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of the undersigned, enforceable against him, her or it in accordance with its
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by general principles of
equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair
dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity).

 



 

 ***** Neither the execution and delivery of this Letter of Transmittal nor
the agreements or other actions contemplated hereby will (a) materially
violate, be in material conflict with, or constitute a material default (or an
event, which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default) under any agreement or commitment to which the undersigned
is a party or (b) violate any statute or law or any judgment, decree, order,
regulation or rule of any court or other governmental authority applicable to
the undersigned.

 



 

The undersigned understands that Buyer may rely upon the representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein as if each such person was a party
to this Letter of Transmittal and shall have the rights, remedies and benefits
under this Letter of Transmittal as if such person was a party hereto. All
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein shall survive the
date hereof. With respect to the representations and warranties contained
above, the undersigned shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company, but excluding any
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates) and their respective
stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, partners, members,
representatives, successors and assigns (" **Buyer Indemnified Parties** "),
and shall reimburse Buyer Indemnified Parties for any loss, liability, demand,
claim, action, cause of action, cost, damage, royalty, deficiency, penalty,
Tax, fine or expense of any kind or nature, whether or not arising out of
third-party claims (including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses and all reasonable amounts paid in investigation or defense, and
all amounts paid in settlement, of any of the foregoing) arising out of,
resulting from, relating to or in connection with the failure of any
representation or warranty made by the undersigned contained above to be true,
correct and complete.

 



 

The undersigned will, upon the reasonable request of the Paying Agent (as
defined below) and/or Buyer, execute and deliver any additional documents
reasonably deemed appropriate or necessary by the Paying Agent and/or Buyer in
connection with the surrender of the In-the-Money Vested Options. All
authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of Transmittal
shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and legal representatives of the undersigned and shall not be
affected by, and shall survive, the death or incapacity of the undersigned.
The surrender of In-the-Money Vested Options hereby is irrevocable.

      
 

 



 

The undersigned understands that surrender is not made in acceptable form
until the receipt by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as paying
agent (the " **Paying Agent** ") of this Letter of Transmittal, duly completed
and signed, and such other documents reasonably requested by the Paying Agent,
**together with** all accompanying evidences of authority in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Paying Agent as may be required by the Instructions and
Stock Purchase Agreement. All questions as to validity, form and eligibility
of any surrender of the In-the-Money Vested Options hereby will be determined
by the Paying Agent in its reasonable discretion and such determination will
be final and binding, absent manifest error.

 



 

 **The undersigned understands that payment for surrendered In-the-Money
Vested Options will be made in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase
Agreement after the delivery of the Letter of Transmittal (and/or other
additional documentation as described herein) in acceptable form.**

PAYMENT WILL BE MADE THROUGH THE COMPANY S PAYROLL, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE
DEDUCTIONS AND WITHHOLDINGS REQUIRED BY LAW.**

 



 

The undersigned agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for (i) all withholding Taxes with respect to the undersigned
(including penalties and interest arising from amounts not withheld pursuant
to the representations and warranties made by, or directions given by or on
behalf of, the undersigned) in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Stock Purchase Agreement and (ii) any inaccuracy in the information
provided by or on behalf of the undersigned in connection herewith.

 



 

The undersigned acknowledges and agrees as follows:

 



 

(a) the undersigned has received and reviewed a notice from the Company which
provided that any Company Options that are not In-the-Money Vested Options
were cancelled without any payment of consideration therefor.

 



 

(b) that the undersigned has read and understands the indemnification
obligations of Article VIII of the Stock Purchase Agreement and hereby agrees
to be bound by the provisions of such section as a "Seller Indemnifying
Party".

 



 

(c) that the appointment of the Sellers Representative as set forth in
Section 8.5 of the Stock Purchase Agreement, with all of the powers and
privileges set forth therein, be agreed to and ratified in all respects.

other information on an IRS Form W-9 or an appropriate IRS Form W-8, as
described below.

      
 

 



 

 ** _IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION_**

 



 

Under United States federal income tax laws, a holder who receives cash
payments pursuant to the Acquisition is required to provide the Paying Agent
(as payer) with such holders correct TIN on the Form W9 below (or otherwise
establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding) and certify under
penalty of perjury that such Tax Identification Number (" **TIN** ") is
correct and that such holder is not subject to backup withholding. If such
holder is an individual, the TIN is his or her social security number. In the
case of an entity, the correct TIN is the holders Employer Identification
Number. If the Paying Agent is not provided with the correct TIN or an
adequate basis for an exemption, a penalty may be imposed by the Internal
Revenue Service (" **IRS** "), and the payment of any cash pursuant to the
Acquisition may be subject to backup withholding.

 



 

Certain holders (including, among others, all corporations and foreign
individuals and entities) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. Exempt holders should indicate their exempt status on
Form W9. In order for a foreign individual or foreign entity to qualify as
exempt from backup withholding, such individual or entity must submit an
appropriate and properly completed Form W8 BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP or W-8IMY, as
the case may be, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to such exempt
status. Such forms and instructions may be obtained from the IRS at its
Internet website: www.irs.gov.

 



 

If backup withholding applies, the Paying Agent is required to withhold at a
rate not to exceed 28% of any payments made to the holder or other payee.
Amounts withheld, if any, under backup withholding rules are generally not an
additional tax and may be refunded or credited against a holders federal
income tax liability, provided that the holder timely furnishes the required
information to the IRS.

 



 

 **Purpose of Form W9**

 



 

To prevent backup withholding on payments made with respect to the In-the-
Money Vested Option(s), the holder is required to notify the Paying Agent of
such holders correct TIN by completing the Form W-9 below, certifying that
(1) the TIN provided on the Form W9 is correct (or that such holder is
awaiting a TIN), (2) such holder is not subject to backup withholding because
(a) such holder is exempt from backup withholding, (b) such holder has not
been notified by the IRS that such holder is subject to backup withholding as
a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends or (c) the IRS has
notified such holder that such holder is no longer subject to backup
withholding and (3) such holder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident
alien).

 



 

 **What Number to Give the Paying Agent**

 



 

The holder is required to give the Paying Agent the TIN (i.e., social security
number or employer identification number) of the holder of the In-the-Money
Vested Option(s) tendered hereby. If the In-the-Money Vested Option(s) are
held in more than one name or are not held in the name of the actual owner,
consult the instructions following the Form W9 for additional guidance on
which number to report.

 ** _EXHIBIT G_**

 



 

 **FORM OF KEY EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT**

      
 

 

 ** **

 

 ** _EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT_**

 



 

This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into to be effective
as of the Effective Date (defined below), by Rocket Games, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and the employee who has executed this Agreement
below ("Employee").

 



 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the transaction (the "Transaction")
contemplated by that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") dated as of
the date hereof, by and among Penn Interactive Ventures, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, the Company, Sellers (as the term is defined in the
SPA) and Sellers Representative (as the term is defined in the SPA), the
Company desires to continue to employ Employee pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and Employee desires to continue to provide personal services to
the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, each of the parties wish to enter into this Agreement, the terms of
which are intended to be in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and
other guidance thereunder and any state law of similar effect ("Section 409A",
see also Section 20 hereof).

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties, in exchange for the mutual promises described
herein and other good and valuable consideration and intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Employment_. The Company hereby agrees to employ Employee and Employee hereby accepts such employment, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth in this Agreement and the offer letter of even date, as may be amended in writing from time to time.

 



 

2. _Term_. This Agreement shall be effective upon the closing (such date, the " _Effective Date_ ") of the SPA. The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall terminate on the earlier of the second anniversary of the Effective Date or the termination of Employees employment with the Company (the "Initial Term"); provided, however, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sections 7 through 20 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the SPA is terminated prior to closing, this Agreement shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be renewed on the same terms and conditions contained herein for a term of one (1) year from the date of expiration of the Initial Term and each one-year period thereafter (each such one-year period, if any, the "Renewal Term"). If either the Company or Employee do not wish to renew this Agreement when it expires at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term or if either the Company or Employee wish to renew this Agreement on different terms than those contained herein, such party shall give written notice of such intent to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date. Reference herein to the "term" of this Agreement shall refer both to the Initial Term and any Renewal Term as the context requires. The Company and Employee agree that the designation of a term herein does not confer any rights with respect to continuation of employment by the Company for the duration of the term or any other specified period, nor interfere with the right of the Company or Employee to terminate this Agreement at any time as set forth in Section 3 below.

 



      
 

 



 

3. _Termination by the Company_.

 



 

(a) _Without Cause_. The Company may terminate Employees employment at any
time without Cause (as such term is defined in subsection (b) below) effective
immediately upon delivery of written notice to Employee, which notice shall
set forth the effective date of such termination. A non-renewal of the term as
set forth in Section 2 above shall not constitute a termination without
"Cause" for purposes of receiving the benefits described in Section 5 below.

 



 

(b) _With Cause_. The Company may terminate Employees employment at any time
for Cause effective immediately upon delivery of written notice to Employee.
As used herein, the term "Cause" shall mean:

 



 

(i) Employee shall have been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere
to, a criminal offense involving allegations of fraud, dishonesty or physical
harm during the term of this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) Employee is found (or is reasonably likely to be found) disqualified or
not suitable to hold a casino or other gaming license by a governmental gaming
authority in any jurisdiction where Employee is required to be found
qualified, suitable or licensed;

 



 

(iii) Employee breaches any significant Company policy or term of this
Agreement and the Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement,
and in each case, fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of
written notice thereof (to the extent curable);

 



 

(iv) Employee misappropriates corporate funds or resources as determined in
good faith by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company;

 



 

(v) the Companys reasonable determination of Employees willful failure to
perform Employees duties with the Company (other than any such failure
resulting from incapacity due to physical disability or mental illness) or
repeated insubordination, and in each case, fails to cure within 30 days after
receipt of written notice thereof; or

 



 

(vi) the Companys reasonable determination of Employees engagement in
illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is or is reasonably expected to be
materially injurious to the Company or one of its affiliates.

 



 

4. _Termination by Employee_.

 



 

(a) Employee may voluntarily terminate employment for any reason effective
upon 30 days prior written notice to the Company, in which case no severance
payments shall be due.

 



 

(b) Employee may terminate employment for Good Reason. As used herein, the
term "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of either of the following
without Employees prior consent either:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) a material reduction by the Company in Employees base salary as in effect
immediately prior to such reduction (unless pursuant to a salary reduction
program applicable generally to the Companys similarly situated employees not
to exceed 20%);

 



 

(ii) a material diminution in Employees position, duties or responsibilities
to a level that is materially inconsistent with Employees skills, experience,
performance and education level; or

 



 

(iii) the relocation of Employees principal place of employment to a facility
or a location more than 35 miles from Employees then-current primary
principal place of employment immediately prior to such relocation that
increases Employees one-way driving commute by more than 35 miles;

 



 

 _provided, however,_ that in each case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above,
Employee has (a) provided written notice of the circumstances establishing
Good Reason within thirty (30) days of the initial existence of such
conditions, (b) given the Company at least thirty (30) days to cure and (c) if
the Company fails to cure, Employee terminates employment within thirty (30)
days following the expiration of the cure period. Any actions taken by the
Company in connection with a termination of Employees employment by the
Company or to accommodate a disability of Employee or pursuant to the Family
and Medical Leave Act shall not be a Good Reason for purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

5. _Severance Pay and Benefits_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 5(d) below, if Employees employment is terminated under Sections 3(a) or 4(b) only, then the Company will provide Employee with the following severance pay and benefits; provided, for purposes of Section 409A, each payment of severance pay under this Section 5 shall be considered a separate payment:

 



 

(a) _Amount of Post-Employment Base Salary_ _._ The Company shall pay to
Employee an amount equal to six (6) months (the "Severance Period") of base
salary at the rate in effect on the date of Employees separation from service
(the "Termination Date"). Subject to Sections 5(d) and 20, such amount shall
be paid in accordance with the Companys regular payroll procedures for
similarly situated employees commencing on the Termination Date.

 



 

(b) _Pro-Rata Bonus_. The Company shall pay to Employee a pro-rata bonus for
the year of termination in an amount equal to the product of (i) the actual
bonus, if any, that Employee would have earned for the year of termination
based on achievement of the applicable performance goals for such year and
(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the
applicable performance year that Employee was employed by the Company and the
denominator of which is 365. Subject to Sections 5(d) and 20, such pro-rate
bonus, if any, shall be paid at the time that annual bonuses are paid to the
Companys similarly situated employees.

 



 

(c) _Continued Medical Benefits Coverage_. Employee and his dependents will
have the opportunity under the provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended ("COBRA") to elect COBRA continuation
coverage. If elected in a timely manner, the Company shall reimburse Employee
for the full cost of purchasing COBRA coverage until the end of the Severance
Period (or until such earlier date as Employee and his

 



      
 

 



 

dependents cease to receive COBRA coverage). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that reimbursement of the
COBRA premiums would result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of
Section 105(h)(2) of the of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not
limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by
the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of
reimbursing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect
to instead pay Employee a fully taxable lump sum cash payment equal to the
COBRA premiums for the Severance Period regardless of whether Employees
elects COBRA continuation coverage, which payment shall be paid within sixty
(60) days of the Termination Date subject to applicable tax withholdings.
Employee may, but is not obligated to, use such payment toward the cost of
COBRA premiums.

 



 

(d) _Release Agreement_. Employees entitlement to any severance pay and
benefit entitlements under this Section 5 is conditioned upon Employees first
entering into a release substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A
("Release"), a draft of which shall be delivered to Employee within 7 days
after the Termination Date, allowing the Release to become effective and
complying with its terms. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, Employee
shall be permitted to modify the Release to the extent necessary to correct
any untrue statement set forth therein, provided that such modification shall
not affect in any way the release set forth in Sections 4 and 5 therein.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, all payments to Employee shall be
delayed until after the expiration of any applicable revocation period with
respect to the Release, but in the event the applicable consideration and
revocation periods span two calendar years, the payments shall commence in the
second calendar year. In no event shall any payment be made later than March
15 of the calendar year following the year in which such payment vests.
Employee also acknowledges that any severance pay under this Section 5 is
subject to the Companys then-current Executive Incentive Compensation
Recoupment Policy, if applicable.

 



 

6. _No Conflicts of Interest_. Employee agrees that throughout the period of Employees employment hereunder, Employee will not perform any activities or services, or accept other employment that would materially interfere with or present a conflict of interest concerning Employees employment with the Company. Employee agrees and acknowledges that Employees employment is conditioned upon Employee adhering to and complying with the business practices and requirements of ethical conduct set forth in writing from time to time by the Company in its employee manual, code of conduct or similar publication. Employee represents and warrants that no other contract, agreement or understanding to which Employee is a party or may be subject to will be violated by the execution of this Agreement by Employee.

 



 

7. _Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement_. As a condition of employment, Employee agrees to execute and abide by the attached Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement and Agreement to Arbitrate Claims (the "Proprietary Information Agreement"), which may be amended in writing by the Company and Employee from time to time without regard to this Agreement. The Proprietary Information Agreement contains provisions that are intended by the Company and Employee to survive and do survive termination of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

8. _Enforceability and Release_.

 



 

(a) _Restrictive Provisions_. As consideration for the foregoing payments,
Employee agrees not to challenge the enforceability of any of the restrictions
contained in the Proprietary Information Agreement upon or after the
occurrence of a change of control of the Company.

 



 

(b) _Release Agreement and Payment Terms_. Employees entitlement to any
severance pay and benefit entitlements under this Agreement is conditioned
upon Employees first entering into a Release. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, all payments to Employee shall be delayed until after the
expiration of any applicable revocation period with respect to the Release,
but in the event the applicable revocation period exceeds 60 days, the
payments shall commence on the 61st day following execution and delivery of
the Release, and all payments for prior periods shall be paid on such 61st
day. In no event shall any payment be made later than March 15 of the calendar
year following the year to which such payment relates.

 



 

9. _Property Surrender_. Upon termination of Employees employment for any reason, Employee shall immediately surrender and deliver to the Company all property that belongs to the Company or its actual or prospective customers, including, but not limited to, any keys, equipment, files, computers, phones, credit cards, disk drives and any documents, correspondence and other information, including all Confidential Information, of any type whatsoever, from the Company or any of its agents, servants, employees, suppliers, and existing or potential customers, that came into Employees possession by any means during the course of employment.

 



 

10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of California.

 



 

11. _Arbitration_. Any and all disputes, claims, or controversies between the parties (specifically including, but not being limited to, any assignee of a party) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the breach thereof, or arising out of Employees employment with or termination from the Company, regardless of whether those are claims under common law or under statutory law, that are not resolved by their mutual agreement shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before JAMS, or its successor, at JAMS office in San Francisco, California, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 _et seq_. as set forth in Sections 23 through Section 27 of the Proprietary Information Agreement. Sections 23 through Sections 27 of the Proprietary Information Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to this Agreement. Pursuant to Ca. Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.8(b), the Company and Employee may apply to a court in San Francisco, California, for injunctive relief pending the outcome of arbitration.

 



 

12. _Notices_. All notices and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement or necessary or convenient in connection herewith shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when hand delivered, delivered by guaranteed next-day delivery or sent by facsimile (with confirmation of transmission) or shall be deemed given on the third business day when mailed by registered or certified mail, as follows (provided that notice of change of address shall be deemed given only when received):

 



      
 

 



 

If to the Company, to:

 



 

Penn National Gaming, Inc.

 

825 Berkshire Boulevard, Suite 200

 

Wyomissing, Pennsylvania 19610

 

Attention: Managing Director of Interactive Gaming (with a copy to the General
Counsel)

 



 

If to Employee, to:

 



 

His or her then current home address.

 



 

or to such other names or addresses as the Company or Employee, as the case
may be, shall designate by notice to each other person entitled to receive
notices in the manner specified in this Section 12.

 



 

13. _Contents of Agreement; Amendment and Assignment_. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings with respect to thereto. This Agreement cannot be changed, modified, extended, waived or terminated except upon a written instrument signed by the party against which it is to be enforced. Employee may not assign any of his rights or obligations under this Agreement. The Company may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any successor to all or substantially all of its assets or business by means of liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, transfer of assets, stock transfer or otherwise, provided such an assignment shall not relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

14. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or application thereof to anyone or under any circumstances is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or application of this Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid or unenforceable provision or application and shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision or application in any other jurisdiction. If any provision is held void, invalid or unenforceable with respect to particular circumstances, it shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect in all other circumstances.

 



 

15. _Remedies_. No remedy conferred upon a party by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given under this Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. No delay or omission by a party in exercising any right, remedy or power under this Agreement or existing at law or in equity shall be construed as a waiver thereof, and any such right, remedy or power may be exercised by such party from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient or necessary by such party in its sole discretion. Employee acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Employee and that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

16. _Construction_. This Agreement is the result of thoughtful negotiations and reflects an arms length bargain between two sophisticated parties, each with an opportunity to be represented by counsel. The parties agree that, if this Agreement requires interpretation, neither party should be considered "the drafter" nor be entitled to any presumption that any ambiguities are to be resolved in such partys favor.

 



 

17. _Beneficiaries/References_. Employee shall be entitled, to the extent permitted under any applicable law, to select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefit payable under this Agreement following Employees death or incapacity by giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of Employees death or a judicial determination of Employees incompetence, reference in this Agreement to Employee shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to Employees beneficiary, estate or other legal representative. Except as provided in this provision or Company affiliates, no third party beneficiaries are intended.

 



 

18. _Withholding_. All payments under this Agreement shall be made subject to applicable tax withholding, and the Company shall withhold from any payments under this Agreement all federal, state and local taxes, as the Company is required to withhold pursuant to any law or governmental rule or regulation. Employee shall bear all expense of, and be solely responsible for, all federal, state and local taxes due with respect to any payment received under this Agreement.

 



 

19. _Regulatory Compliance_. The terms and provisions hereof shall be conditioned on and subject to compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations of all jurisdictions, or agencies, boards or commissions thereof, having regulatory jurisdiction over the employment or activities of Employee hereunder.

 



 

20. _Section 409A_. The payments due under this Agreement are intended to satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Section 409A, but to the extent that such payments are not exempt, this Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, incorporates by reference all required definitions and payment terms, and shall be construed accordingly. Any payments or distributions to be made to Employee under this Agreement upon a separation from service (as defined in Section 409A) of amounts classified as "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A and do not satisfy an exemption from the time and form of payment requirements of Section 409A, shall in no event be made or commence until six months after such separation from service if Employee is a specified employee (as defined in Section 409A). Each payment of nonqualified deferred compensation under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. Any reimbursements made pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid as soon as practicable but no later than 90 days after Employee submits evidence of such expenses to the Company (which payment date shall in no event be later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred). The amount of such reimbursements during any calendar year shall not affect the benefits provided in any other calendar year, and the right to any such benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not have any liability to the Employee or to any other person if the payments and benefits provided 

 



      
 

 



 

in this Agreement that are intended to be exempt from or compliant with
Section 409A are not so exempt or compliant.

Exhibit A

 



 

SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE

 



 

This is a Separation Agreement and General Release (hereinafter referred to as
the "Agreement") between [ ] (hereinafter referred to as the
"Employee") and Rocket Games, Inc. and its affiliates (hereinafter referred to
as the "Employer"). In consideration of the mutual promises and commitments
made in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, Employee, on the
one hand, and the Employer on the other hand, agree to the terms set forth in
this Agreement.

 



 

1. Employee is party to an Employment Agreement dated [DATE] (the "Employment Agreement"). Employer and Employee hereby acknowledge that the Employment Agreement was terminated on [DATE], which shall be Employees last day of work with the Company (the "Termination Date"). Employee hereby resigns from any other positions Employee may hold with the Employers parent, subsidiary and affiliated corporations as of the Termination Date.

 



 

2. (a) Following the execution of this Agreement, Employee will be entitled to the post-employment benefits set forth in Section 5 of the Employment Agreement and subject to the post-employment responsibilities set forth in his or her Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement and Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement and Agreement to Arbitrate Claims remains in effect and Employee hereby agrees to comply with the obligations and restrictions contained therein.

 



 

(b) If Employee accepts any employment with the Employer, or an affiliate or
related entity of the Employer, and becomes reemployed during the Severance
Period (as defined in the Employment Agreement), Employee acknowledges and
agrees that they will forfeit all future severance payments from the date on
which reemployment commences.

 



 

3. (a) When used in this Agreement, the word "Releasees" means the Employer and all or any of its past and present parent, subsidiary and affiliated corporations, companies, partnerships, joint ventures and other entities and their groups, divisions, departments and units, and their past and present directors, trustees, officers, managers, partners, supervisors, employees, attorneys, agents and consultants, and their predecessors, successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) When used in this Agreement, the word "Claims" means each and every claim,
complaint, cause of action, and grievance, whether known or unknown and
whether fixed or contingent, and each and every promise, assurance, contract,
representation, guarantee, warranty, right and commitment of any kind, whether
known or unknown and whether fixed or contingent.

 



 

4. In consideration of the promises of the Employer set forth in this Agreement and the Employment Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, Employee hereby irrevocably remises, releases and forever discharges all Releasees of and from any and all Claims that he or she (on behalf of either himself or herself or any other person or persons) ever had or now has against any and all of the Releasees, or which he or she (or his or her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns or any of them) hereafter can, shall or may have against any and all of the Releasees, for or by reason of any cause, matter, thing, occurrence or event whatsoever through the effective date of this Agreement. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Claims released in this paragraph include, but are not limited to, (a) any and all Claims based on any law, statute or constitution or based on contract or in tort on common law, and (b) any and all Claims based on or arising under any civil rights laws, such as any Pennsylvania or Illinois employment laws, or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.), or the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.) (hereinafter referred to as the "ADEA"), or California Labor Code, as amended, or the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, as amended ("FEHA"), and (c) any and all Claims under any grievance or complaint procedure of any

 



      
 

 



 

kind, and (d) any and all Claims based on or arising out of or related to his
recruitment by, employment with, the termination of his employment with, his
performance of any services in any capacity for, or any business transaction
with, each or any of the Releasees. Employee also understands, that by signing
this Agreement, he or she is waiving all Claims against any and all of the
Releasees released by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that nothing in
this Agreement (i) constitutes or shall be construed to constitute, as set
forth in section 7(f)(1)(c) of the ADEA, as added by the Older Workers Benefit
Protection Act of 1990, a waiver by Employee of any rights or claims that may
arise after this Agreement is executed by Employee, or (ii) constitutes, or
shall be construed to constitute, a waiver of any rights which are not
waivable as a matter of law, including any rights under applicable
unemployment compensation and workers compensation laws, (iii) shall waive
any rights for indemnification under any written agreement with the Company or
coverage under any DandO insurance policy or (iv) impair Employees right to
file a charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"),
the National Labor Relations Board, the California Fair Employment and Housing
Commission, or any similar state or local agency or to participate in an
investigation or proceeding conducted by such agencies, or to take any action
protected under the whistleblower provisions of any federal securities law,
none of which activities shall constitute a breach of the release,
cooperation, non-disparagement or confidentiality clauses of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee agrees to waive Employees right to
recover individual relief in any charge, complaint, or lawsuit filed by
Employee or anyone on Employees behalf.

 



 

5. Employee acknowledges that Employee has read Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California that provides as follows:

 



 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 



 

Employee waive any right or benefit that Employee has or may have under
Section 1542 of the Civil Code, any similar law of any other jurisdiction, or
any common law principles of similar effect, to the full extent that Employee
may lawfully waive all such rights and benefits pertaining to the subject
matter of this release. Employee acknowledges that Employee or Employees
representatives may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to or
different from those that Employee now know or believe to exist with respect
to the subject matter of this release, but that it is Employees intention in
executing this release and in giving and receiving the consideration called
for by it to fully, finally and forever settle and release all of the matters
released herein. In furtherance of this intention, the release herein granted
shall be and remain in effect notwithstanding the discovery of any such
additional or different claim or fact.

 



 

6. Employee further certifies that he or she is not aware of any actual or attempted regulatory, EEOC, FEHA or other legal violations by Employer and that his or her separation is not a result of retaliation based on any legal rights or opposition to an illegal practice.

 



 

7. Employee covenants and agrees not to sue the Releasees and each or any of them for any Claims released by this Agreement and to waive any recovery related to any Claims covered by this Agreement.

 



 

8. Employee agrees to provide reasonable transition assistance to Employer (including without limitation assistance on regulatory matters, operational matters and in connection with litigation) for a period of four months from the execution of this Agreement at no additional cost; provided, such assistance shall not unreasonably interfere with Employees pursuit of gainful employment or result in

      
 

 



 

Employee not having a separation from service (as defined in Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). Any assistance beyond this period will be
provided at a mutually agreed cost.

For clarity, Employee acknowledges that upon his separation date, he or she has no further rights under any bonus arrangement or option plan of Employer. Employee further acknowledges that he or she has not experienced or reported any work-related injury or illness.

 



 

10. Except where disclosure has been made by the Company pursuant to applicable federal or state law, rule or regulation, Employee agrees that the terms of this Agreement are confidential and that he or she will not disclose or publicize the terms of this Agreement and the amounts paid or agreed to be paid pursuant to this Agreement to any person or entity, except to his spouse, his attorney, his accountant, and to a government agency for the purpose of payment or collection of taxes or application for unemployment compensation benefits. Employee agrees that his disclosure of the terms of this Agreement to his spouse, his attorney and his accountant shall be conditioned upon his obtaining agreement from them, for the benefit of the Employer, not to disclose or publicize to any person or entity the terms of this Agreement and the amounts paid or agreed to be paid under this Agreement. Further, Employee agrees not to make any false, misleading, defamatory or disparaging communications, including blogs, posts on Facebook, twitter, other forms of social media or any such similar communications, about the Employer (including without limitation Employers products, services, partners, investors or personnel) and to refrain from taking any action designed to harm the public perception of the Employer or the Releasees. Employee further agrees that he or she has disclosed to Employer all information, if any, in his possession, custody or control related to any legal, compliance or regulatory obligations of Employer and any failures to meet such obligations.

 



 

11. The terms of this Agreement are not to be considered as an admission on behalf of either party. Neither this Agreement nor its terms shall be admissible as evidence of any liability or wrongdoing by each or any of the Releasees in any judicial, administrative or other proceeding now pending or hereafter instituted by any person or entity. The Employer is entering into this Agreement solely for the purpose of effectuating a mutually satisfactory separation of Employees employment.

 



 

12. Sections 9, 10, 11 and 20 of the Employment Agreement shall also apply to this Agreement.

 



 

13. Along with the surviving provisions of the Employment Agreement, this Agreement constitutes a complete and final agreement between the parties and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous agreements, offer letters, severance policies and plans, negotiations, or discussions relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and no other agreement shall be binding upon each or any of the Releasees, including, but not limited to, any agreement made hereafter, unless in writing and signed by an officer of the Employer, and only such agreement shall be binding against the Employer.

 



 

14. Employee is advised, and acknowledges that he or she has been advised, to consult with an attorney before signing this Agreement.

      
 

 



 

15. Employee acknowledges that he or she is signing this Agreement voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and consequences of its terms.

 **COMPANY BONUS RETENTION PLAN**

      
 

 



 

 **ROCKET GAMES, INC. 
BONUS RETENTION PLAN**

 



    

 **Purpose**

 |  



 |  

The purpose of the Plan is to induce key contributors to remain with Rocket
Games, Inc. (the " ** _Company_** "), and to enhance the Companys value, by
providing incentive bonuses following the closing of the transactions
contemplated by that certain Stock Purchase Agreement by and between the
Company, [Buyer] (" ** _Buyer_** ") and certain other parties thereto, dated
as of July , 2016 (the " ** _SPA_** ," and the transactions contemplated
thereby, the " ** _Purchase_** "). 

---|---|--- 
   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Triggering Event**

 |  



 |  

Benefits under the Plan are payable if and only if any Second Upside Earnout
Payment (as such term is defined in the SPA) is paid to the Companys
stockholders. 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Size of Pool (the " _Pool_ ")**

 |  



 |  

The Pool is an amount equal to 50% of the Second Upside Earnout Payment, up to
a maximum amount of $10,000,000, subject to the Buyers right of setoff
described below. 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Selection of Participants**

 |  



 |  

Employees of the Company designated by resolution of the Companys Board of
Directors who remain employed by the Company, Buyer or a subsidiary thereof as
of the closing date of the Purchase (the " ** _Closing Date_** ") and
individuals who commence employment with the Company following the Closing
Date designated by resolution of the Companys Board of Directors shall be
eligible to be participants in the Plan (the " ** _Participants_** "). 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Allocation of Pool**

 |  



 |  

Each Participants allocation will be as determined by the Companys Board of
Directors, which such determination with respect to Participants shall be made
prior to the Closing Date. Each Participant shall be allocated a number of
units (each a " ** _Unit_** ") by the Companys Board of Directors.

 



 

Each Eligible Participants actual benefit under the Plan (an " ** _Eligible
Participant Benefit_** ") will be calculated as of the last day of the Second
Earnout Period (as defined in the APA), according to the following formula:

 



 

Eligible Participant Benefit = (Eligible Participants Units / total Units
outstanding) x the amount of the Pool 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Prerequisites for Payment**

 |  



 |  

Benefits are paid only to Participants who remain employed by the Company,
Buyer or a subsidiary thereof as of the last day of the Second Earnout Period
(each an " ** _Eligible Participant_** "). 

      
 

 



    

 **Form of Payment**

 |  



 |  

Eligible Participant Benefits will be paid in cash through the payroll of
Buyer, the Company or its successor. 

---|---|--- 
   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Time of Payment**

 |  



 |  

Each Eligible Participant Benefit, if any, will be paid as soon as practicable
after the end of the Second Earnout Period, but in no event more than 10
business days after the Second Upside Earnout Payment, if any, is delivered to
the Companys stockholders. 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Right to Offset**

 |  



 |  

Buyer, the Company or its successor shall have the right to offset against its
obligation to pay any portion of an Eligible Participant Benefit any
outstanding amount of whatever nature that the Eligible Participant then owes
to Buyer, the Company or its successor in the capacity as an employee in
accordance with Sections 2.5(e) and (f) of the SPA. 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Withholding Taxes**

 |  



 |  

All payments under the Plan will be reduced as necessary to pay withholding
and payroll taxes and other deductions required by law. In the event that
payments are made in a form other than cash, each Eligible Participant must
make arrangements satisfactory to the Company in order to satisfy all
applicable withholding requirements. 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Section 409A**

 |  



 |  

It is intended that payments under the Plan satisfy, to the greatest extent
possible, the exemption from the application of Section 409A of the Code (and
any state law of similar effect) provided under Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(b)(4) (as a "short-term deferral").

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company or any successor
be responsible for or have any obligation to reimburse an Eligible Participant
for any taxes that may be imposed on an Eligible Participant under Section
409A of the Code. 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Source of Payments**

 |  



 |  

The Company or its successor will make all payments under the Plan from its
general assets. The Companys obligations under the Plan are unfunded and
unsecured, and Eligible Participants have no rights other than those of
general creditors. 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **No Assignment of Benefits**

 |  



 |  

Benefits under the Plan are not assignable or transferable by Participants
before they are paid. Benefits will be paid only to the Eligible Participants
who are entitled to receive them under the Plan. 

   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Employment at Will**

 |  



 |  

Employment with the Company, Buyer or any successor thereto is for no specific
period of time. Participation in the Plan does not confer any right to
continued employment, and a Participants employment is "at will." Therefore,
either the Participant or the Participants employer may terminate the
Participants employment at any time and for any reason, with or without
cause. 

 



      
 

 



    

 **Administration**

 |  



 |  

The Plan will be interpreted and administered by the Companys Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors. Any
reference to the Board of Directors in this Plan will be construed as a
reference to the committee of the Board of Directors (if any) to whom the
Board of Directors has assigned a particular function. The determinations of
the Board of Directors with regard to the Plan will be final and binding on
all Participants. Following the closing of the Purchase, references to the
Companys Board of Directors shall be interpreted as a reference to the Board
of Directors of Buyer or a duly authorized committee thereof. 

---|---|--- 
   

 ** **

 |  



 |  


 
   

 **Amendment and Termination**

 |  



 |  

Prior to closing of the Purchase, the Companys Board of Directors may
terminate the Plan or amend it in any respect. Thereafter, the Plan may not be
amended or terminated without the consent of each adversely affected
Participant.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Plan will expire automatically if the
Purchase is not consummated on or prior to September 1, 2016.

 **ROCKET GAMES, INC.**

 



 

 **OPTION CANCELLATION AGREEMENT**

Holder" on the signature page hereto (the " ** _Option Holder_** ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Option Holder has been granted an option or options to
purchase shares of the Companys Common Stock (each, a " ** _Company Option_**

 **WHEREAS** , the Company has entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "

limited purposes, pursuant to which Buyer will purchase from the Sellers, and
the Sellers will sell and transfer to Buyer, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company (the " ** _Purchase_** "), which
Purchase is expected to close on or about August 1, 2016 (the " ** _Closing
Date_** ," and the time of the actual closing, the " ** _Closing_** ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , in connection with the Purchase, the vesting of certain Company
Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing will be accelerated
as if the holder thereof had completed an additional 12 months of continuous
service to the Company (the vested portion of each Company Option, after
taking into account the acceleration described in this recital, a " ** _Vested
Option_** ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , and as further described in the Purchase Agreement, certain
vested Company Options outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing will
be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive cash payment in accordance
with the Purchase Agreement (such amounts, collectively, the " ** _Option
Payout_** "); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , each unvested Company Option outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing will be cancelled without the payment of any
consideration in respect thereto.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and
agreements set forth herein, the sufficiency of which the parties acknowledge,
the parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** **OPTION PAYOUT; CANCELLATION OF COMPANY OPTIONS**. In consideration
for the partial vesting acceleration described in the Recitals, the Option
Holder agrees that each Company Option (including all shares, if any, that
remain unvested as of immediately prior to the Closing) shall be terminated
and cancelled at the Closing. Except for the right to receive the Option
Payout with respect to the vested portion of each Company Option held by the
Option

      
 

 



 

Holder (less all applicable payroll and income tax and other withholdings
required by law), on the terms and conditions described in the Purchase
Agreement, the Option Holder acknowledges and agrees that the Option Holder
shall cease, as of the Closing, to have any further right or entitlement to
acquire any shares of the Companys capital stock or any other consideration
of any kind from the Company, Buyer, or any of their affiliates in respect of
each Option Holders Company Options. In addition, by signing this Agreement,
the Option Holder acknowledges and agrees that the only Company Options held
by the Option Holder are those described in _Exhibit A_ hereto.

 



 

 **2.** **NO EXERCISE. **In consideration of the right to receive the Option
Payout, the Option Holder agrees not to exercise any Company Option (or any
portion thereof) prior to the termination of the Purchase Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

 **3.** **RELEASE**. Effective as of the date hereof, the Option Holder
acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and each of its agents, trustees,
beneficiaries, directors, officers, managers, affiliates, subsidiaries,
stockholders, members, partners, family members, heirs, executors,
administrators, estate, successors and assigns (each, a " ** _Releasing
Party_** ") that each hereby waives, releases, promises never to assert and
forever discharges the Company, Buyer, and any of their current and former
directors, officers, managers, employees, representatives, consultants,
attorneys, agents, members, stockholders, successors, parents, affiliates or
subsidiaries, predecessors and assigns (each, a " ** _Released Party_** " and

actions, causes of action or demands such person has or may have against any
of the Released Parties as of the date hereof, whether asserted or unasserted,

limitation, those relating to any Company Option that any of the Releasing
Parties had, have or may have or claim to have against any of the Released
Parties, in each case of every nature and extent whatsoever, including
(without limitation) claims to stock options, equity or equity-based
compensation, attorneys fees or costs, fraud, breach of contract or breach of
the covenant of good faith and fair dealing (the " ** _Claims_** "). However,
this release covers only those Claims that arose prior to the execution of
this Agreement and only those Claims that may be waived by applicable law.
Execution of this Agreement does not bar any Claim that arises hereafter,

and understands Section 1542 of the California Civil Code which reads as

settlement with the debtor.**

 



 

The Option Holder hereby expressly waives, releases and discharges all of the
Option Holders rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code and any
law or legal principle of similar

 



      
 

 



 

effect in any jurisdiction with respect to the Option Holders release of
claims herein, including but not limited to the release of unknown and
unsuspected claims.

adviser if such individuals agree that they will not disclose to others the
existence or terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **6.** **MISCELLANEOUS**.

 



 

 **6.1** **Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed

Closing).

 



 

 **6.3** **Severability.** In the event one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had
