PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

This Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2020 (this " _Agreement_ "),
is made and entered into by and between Kaiser Aluminum Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and Alcoa Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Seller_ "). Buyer and Seller are sometimes referred to in this
Agreement together as the " _Parties_ " or individually as a " _Party_ ".
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement are defined in _Annex
A_.

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Alcoa USA Corp., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Seller (the " _Equity Seller_ "), owns all of the issued and
outstanding membership interests of the Company (the " _Equity_ ");

 

WHEREAS, Seller is engaged through the Company and certain other Subsidiaries
in the Rolling Mill Business;

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the
Parties desire the Equity Seller to sell to Buyer, and Buyer to purchase from
the Equity Seller, all of the Equity; and

WHEREAS, at the Closing, Seller or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Buyer or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, will enter into the Ancillary
Agreements.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and other
good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which hereby are
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY

 

Section 1.1. _Purchase and Sale of Equity_. Each of Buyer and Seller hereby
agrees that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ , at the
Closing, Buyer shall purchase from the Equity Seller, and Seller shall cause
the Equity Seller to sell, transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer, all of the Equity Sellers right, title and interest
in and to the Equity, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
restrictions on transfer under applicable securities Laws).

 

Section 1.2. _Pre-Closing Transfers of Certain Rolling Mill Assets and
Excluded Assets; Assumption of Assumed Liabilities_. Seller shall take, or
cause one or more of its Affiliates to take, the Pre-Closing Restructuring
actions described in _Section_ __ _ 5.24_ to transfer, effective as of, or
prior to, the Effective Time, (a) the Rolling Mill Assets not held by the
Company from the Rolling Mill Affiliates to the Company and (b) the Excluded
Assets held by the Company from the Company to Seller or to its Retained
Subsidiaries. Each of Buyer and Seller hereby agrees that upon the terms and
subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible waivers of the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE VI_ , at the Closing, Buyer shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities.

   

Section 1.3. _Purchase Price_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller, in
full consideration for the purchase of the Equity an amount of cash equal to
$670,000,000 (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ ") by electronic funds transfer
of immediately available funds, and Buyer shall assume the Assumed
Liabilities. The Initial Purchase Price is subject to adjustment pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)_ (as so adjusted, the " _Closing Consideration_ "). The
Closing Consideration is subject to adjustment following the Closing as
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.36_.

Section 1.4. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date: (i) a statement setting forth Sellers good
faith estimate of (x) the Net Working Capital, (y) the Outstanding
Indebtedness Amount and (z) the Employee Amounts, in each case, as of 11:59
p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ") and
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles (the " _Estimated
Settlement Statement_ "), together with such schedules and data as may be
appropriate to support such statement, and (ii) a funds flow statement
including wire transfer instructions (the " _Funds Flow Statement_ "). Seller
shall in good faith consider any changes requested by Buyer to the Estimated
Settlement Statement and the Funds Flow Statement.

(b) The Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows: (i) decreased by
the Outstanding Indebtedness Amount and the Employee Amounts, (ii) increased,
if the Net Working Capital set forth on the Estimated Settlement Statement
calculated in accordance with the formulas and methodologies on _Schedule
11.1(a)_ results in a positive adjustment to the Purchase Price, and (iii)
decreased, if the Net Working Capital set forth on the Estimated Settlement
Statement calculated in accordance with the formulas and methodologies on
_Schedule 11.1(a)_ results in a negative adjustment to the Purchase Price, in
each case, as of the Effective Time and prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles (the total net increase or decrease, as the case may be,
being the " _Estimated Closing Adjustment_ ").

 

(c) After Closing, Seller shall engage Willis Towers Watson (the " _Actuary
Firm_ ") to prepare a certified actuarial report setting forth the Assumed
Union Employee Retirement Ineligible OPEB Liability and the Assumed Union
Employee Retirement Eligible OPEB Liability, in each case, as of the Effective
Time, calculated under actuarial measurements and assumptions consistent with
Sellers ongoing plans. Within sixty (60) days following Closing, Seller shall
deliver this report to Buyer.

 

(d) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a statement setting forth Buyers calculation of the actual amounts of
(i) the Net Working Capital, (ii) the Outstanding Indebtedness Amount, and
(iii) the Employee Amounts, in each case, as of the Effective Time prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles (the " _Final Settlement Statement_
"), together with such schedules and data as may be appropriate to support
such calculation. Any actions taken by Buyer at or after the Effective Time
shall not be taken into account for the purpose of preparing the Final
Settlement Statement or calculating the amounts therein.

 



2

    

(e) Seller shall have sixty (60) days following receipt of the Final
Settlement Statement to review the Final Settlement Statement and to notify
Buyer in writing of any dispute regarding the calculations in the Final
Settlement Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), specifying the reasons for
any difference in Sellers calculation of the Final Settlement Statement in
reasonable detail. If no Dispute Notice is delivered by Seller within such
sixty (60) day review period or if Buyer delivers a written acceptance of the
Final Settlement Statement during such sixty (60) day period, then such Final
Settlement Statement and the calculations set forth therein shall become final
and binding as of the end of the sixty (60) day review period or the date of
receipt by Seller of such written acceptance, as applicable.

(f) In connection with Buyers preparation of the Final Settlement Statement
and with Sellers review, the Parties and their Representatives shall have
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all
relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda, books and records, and other
documents of Seller, the Company, their Affiliates or the Representatives of
each of the foregoing, subject to executing customary access letters, and to
the finance personnel of Seller, the Company and any of their Affiliates and
any other information which the Parties reasonably request, and each of the
Parties shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate reasonably with
the other Party and its Representatives in connection therewith.

 

(g) In the event that Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer, Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any differences in the
Final Settlement Statements as promptly as practicable and, upon such
resolution, if any, any adjustments to the Final Settlement Statement shall be
made as agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller. If Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve any such differences within twenty (20) Business Days
(or such longer period as Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree in writing) of
Buyers delivery of such Dispute Notice, such differences shall be resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm, and such determination by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the Parties; _provided_ that (i)
the Independent Accounting Firm may consider only those adjustments and
amounts as to which Buyer and Seller have disagreed within the time periods
and on the terms specified above and (ii) the Independent Accounting Firms
determination of the disputed items in the Final Settlement Statement may not
be outside of the range of amounts claimed by the respective Parties with
respect to those adjustments in dispute in the Final Settlement Statement.
Seller shall pay a portion of the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm equal to 100% multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the dollar amount of the objections submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm that are resolved in favor of Buyer (that being the difference
between the Independent Accounting Firms determination and Sellers
determination) and the denominator of which is the total dollar amount of
objections submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm (that being the sum
total by which Buyers determination and Sellers determination differ
from the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm). Buyer shall pay
that portion of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm that
Seller is not required to pay under this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(g)_. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall include such apportionment of its fees and
expenses in its determination. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be
instructed to use reasonable best efforts to make its final determination
within thirty (30) days of submission by the Parties hereto of the dispute to
it and, in any case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. Buyer
and Seller each shall furnish the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers
and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the
Independent Accounting Firm shall reasonably request. The adjustments to the
Estimated Closing Adjustment set forth in the Final Settlement Statement shall
be deemed final (the total net increase or decrease, as the case may be,
being the " _Final Closing Adjustment_ ") (x) in accordance with

  _Section_ __ _ 1.4(e)_ as originally submitted by Buyer if Seller does not
timely deliver a Dispute Notice or if Seller accepts Buyers Final Settlement
Statement or (y) if a Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by Buyer, (1)
as mutually agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.4(g)_ or (2) as determined by the Independent Accounting
Firm in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(g)_.

(h) The " _Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to (i) the Closing Consideration,
plus (ii) the amount, if any, required to be paid by Buyer to Seller pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 1.4(i)_, minus (iii) the amount, if any, required to be
paid by Seller to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4(i)_.

(i) In the event that (i) the Final Closing Adjustment is greater than the
Estimated Closing Adjustment, Buyer shall pay Seller the amount by which the
Final Closing Adjustment is greater than the Estimated Closing Adjustment or
(ii) the Final Closing Adjustment is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Final Closing
Adjustment is less than the Estimated Closing Adjustment.

(j) Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.4(g)_, make payment in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ by
electronic funds transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, of the amount payable by
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be.

 

Section 1.5. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price, as increased
by the Liabilities of the Company as of the Effective Time and the Assumed
Liabilities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding
Indebtedness Amounts and the Employee Amounts), in each case, as finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4_, and all other
amounts constituting consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (the
" _Tax Consideration_ ") shall be allocated among the assets of the Company
for all Tax purposes in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Within
ninety (90) days after the Final Closing Adjustment is determined in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.4_, Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft
allocation of the Tax Consideration among the assets of the Company (the "
_Allocation_ "). Seller shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of said
Allocation to review the Allocation. To the extent that Seller disagrees with
the Allocation or any items therein, Seller shall notify Buyer in
writing within such thirty (30) day period as prescribed by the immediately
preceding sentence. The Parties shall thereafter endeavor in good faith to
resolve such dispute and to the extent they are unable to do so within ten
(10) Business Days, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.4(g)_, which
resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Buyer, the
Company and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
including, in the case of Seller, the Rolling Mill Affiliates, to) report, act
and file Tax Returns in all respects and for all Tax purposes consistent with
the Allocation. No Party shall take any position for Tax purposes
inconsistent with the Allocation unless required by any determination within
the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code. Each Party shall provide prompt
notice to the other Party of any audit, inquiry, assessment, Actions or
similar events by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Allocation.

Section 1.6. _Withholding Taxes_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to Seller or to any other Person such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of applicable Tax Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , if Buyer determines that an amount is required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to any amounts payable (other than as
compensation), prior to the date the applicable payment is scheduled to be
made, Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice of its intent to deduct
and withhold, and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Seller to eliminate or reduce the basis for such deduction or withholding
(including providing Seller with a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or
other evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding). To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. Buyer shall timely remit to the appropriate
Governmental Authority all such amounts deducted or withheld.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 

Except as disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedules, Seller represents and
warrants to Buyer as follows:

 

Section 3.1. _Due Organization and_ _Good Standing_. Each of Seller, the
Company and the Rolling Mill Affiliates is duly formed and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Each
of Seller, the Company and the Rolling Mill Affiliates is qualified or
otherwise authorized to act as a foreign corporation or limited
liability company and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which such
qualification or authorization is necessary under applicable Law, except where
the failure to be so qualified or otherwise authorized would not materially
impair or delay its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party on a timely
basis. Each of Seller, the Company and the Rolling Mill Affiliates has all
requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and the Rolling Mill Assets and to conduct
the Rolling Mill Business as now conducted, except where the failure to have
such power 

 



8

    

 and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, be expected to be
material to the Rolling Mill Business. Prior to the execution of this
Agreement, Seller has caused to be made available to Buyer true and complete
copies of the certificate of formation of the Company and the Company LLC
Agreement. Such certificate of formation and the Company LLC Agreement are in
full force and effect.

 

Section 3.2. _Authority_. Each of Seller, the Company and the Rolling Mill
Affiliates has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, as applicable, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,
delivery and performance by Seller, the Company and the Rolling Mill
Affiliates of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party, as applicable, and the consummation by Seller, the Company and the
Rolling Mill Affiliates of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited
liability company action on the part of Seller, the Company and the Rolling
Mill Affiliates, as applicable, and no other proceedings on the part of
Seller, the Company and the Rolling Mill Affiliates are necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance by Seller, the Company and the Rolling
Mill Affiliates of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is
a party, as applicable, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer, constitutes, and
each Ancillary Agreement, when executed and delivered by Seller, the Company
and the Rolling Mill Affiliates (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties thereto) shall constitute, a valid and
binding obligation of Seller, the Company and such Rolling Mill Affiliate, as
applicable, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms
(except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
moratorium, reorganization, preference or similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in equity or at law) (the " _General Enforceability Exceptions_ ")).

Section 3.3. _Capitalization_. The Equity has been duly authorized, validly
issued and fully paid and is non-assessable, and the Equity has not been
issued in violation of any preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or
similar rights. The Company has no other equity interests authorized, issued
or outstanding, and there are no (a) agreements, options, warrants,
convertible securities or other rights or arrangements existing or outstanding
that provide for the sale or issuance of any of the foregoing by the
Company, (b) outstanding obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any equity or debt interests of the
Company, or (c) bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of the Company
having the right to vote or consent (or, which are convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote or consent) on any
matters on which the equity holders of the Company may vote, and no securities
or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, the Equity Seller is the sole beneficial and legal owner of the
Equity, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than restrictions on
transfer under applicable securities Laws).

Section 3.4. _Governmental Filings_. Except (a) as set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 3.4_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or (b) Governmental Filings under
the HSR Act, no filing or registration with, notification to, or
authorization, consent, waiver, approval, license or permit of
any Governmental Authority (collectively, " _Governmental Filings_ ") is
required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements by Seller, the Company and the Rolling
Mill Affiliates, as applicable, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, by Seller, the Company and the Rolling Mill
Affiliates, other than Governmental Filings the failure of which to be
obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the Rolling Mill Business or materially
impair or materially delay the ability of Seller, the Company and the Rolling
Mill Affiliates to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 3.5. _No Conflict or Violation_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 3.5_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and assuming all Governmental
Filings described or listed in _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules have been obtained or made (and any applicable waiting period has
expired or terminated), the execution, delivery and performance by Seller and
the Rolling Mill Affiliates of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as
applicable, and the consummation by Seller and the Rolling Mill Affiliates of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not (a) violate any Law to
which Seller, the Company or the Rolling Mill Affiliates is subject, except
such violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be materially adverse to the Rolling Mill Business or
materially impair or materially delay the ability of Seller or the Rolling
Mill Affiliates to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) require a consent or approval under, result in a breach of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under,
result in the acceleration of, create in any party the right to accelerate,
terminate or cancel any Material Contract, except such failures to obtain
consent or approval, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations
cancellations and accelerations which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Rolling
Mill Business or materially impair or materially delay the ability of Seller,
the Company or the Rolling Mill Affiliates to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or (c) violate the certificate of
incorporation or formation, by-laws, operating agreement or other
organizational documents of Seller, the Company or any Rolling Mill Affiliate,
as applicable.

 

Section 3.6. _Financial Statements_. _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true, correct and complete copy of the
Financial Statements. The Financial Statements were prepared from the books
and records of Seller and the Company in accordance with GAAP (except as
referenced in the Financial Statements) consistently applied, and fairly
present in all material respects the financial position of the Rolling Mill
Business as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows
of the Rolling Mill Business for the periods then ended, subject to normal
year-end adjustments, which individually or in the aggregate are not material
to the Financial Statements, and the absence of disclosure normally made in
footnotes to audited financial statements. The Rolling Mill Business has not
operated as a separate "stand-alone" entity within Seller. All of the
Financial Statements are therefore qualified by the fact that the Rolling Mill
Business received certain allocated charges and credits for corporate-level
support services as referenced in the Financial Statements, which do not
necessarily reflect the amounts that would have resulted from arms-length
transactions or which the Rolling Mill Business would incur on a stand-alone
basis. 

 



10

    

Section 3.7. _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) for Liabilities that
are reflected in or reserved against in the Financial Statements, (b) for
Liabilities disclosed or referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, (c) for Liabilities incurred or permitted to
be incurred under this Agreement, (d) for the Retained Liabilities, and (e)
for Liabilities arising since September 30, 2020 in the ordinary course of
business, the Rolling Mill Business is not subject to any Liabilities that
would be required to be set forth on a balance sheet prepared in accordance
with GAAP, other than Liabilities which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Rolling Mill Business.

 

Section 3.8. _Absence of Certain Changes_ _._ Except as set forth in _Section_
__ _ 3.8_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, from September 30, 2020
through the date of this Agreement, there has not occurred any Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.8_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, from September 30, 2020 through the date of this
Agreement, the Company and the Rolling Mill Affiliates (as applicable) have
conducted the Rolling Mill Business in the ordinary course of business, and
none of the Company or the Rolling Mill Affiliates (as applicable) have taken
or agreed to take any action that, if taken during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Closing without Buyers consent, would constitute a
breach of  _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_.

Section 3.9. _Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
3.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or for Actions solely relating to the
Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities, there are no material Actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller, the
Company or any Rolling Mill Affiliate (with respect to the Rolling Mill
Business). Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, none of (i) the Company nor (ii) with respect to the
Rolling Mill Business, Seller or any Rolling Mill Affiliate has received
notice that it is subject to any injunction, audit, investigation, writ,
judgment, decree or Order of any Governmental Authority.

identifies all real property underlying the Smelter and the Power Plant and
the business and operations thereof (such real property, the " _Smelter and

any Affiliate thereof, and each sets forth the and acreage of each parcel of
the Real Property. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.10(a)(iii)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, the Company has good, valid and indefeasible
title to, the Rolling Mill Real Property free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than Permitted Encumbrances. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.10(a)(iv)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, neither the Company nor any
Affiliate thereof has (i) offered or agreed to sell or grant a leasehold,
license or other interest in all or any portion of the Rolling Mill Real
Property to any Person, nor granted to any Person a right or option to
purchase, right of first refusal or right of first offer to acquire such

(b) _Real Property in General_. (i) The Rolling Mill Real Property comprises
all of the real property used in the operation of the Rolling Mill Business,
(ii) there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any threatened

the Real Property, nor has Seller or the Company or their
respective Affiliates received notice of any such proceedings, (iii) none of
the Company or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates has received
notice that the current use or occupancy of the Rolling Mill Real Property
violates any easement, covenant, condition, restriction or similar provision
in any instrument of record or other unrecorded agreement, any provisions
governing use under an applicable lease, or any zoning, building, health,
subdivision, fire, labor, site plan, redevelopment or other similar laws,
ordinances, requirements or restrictions affecting such Rolling Mill Real
Property, except to the extent such violation constitutes a Permitted

have been withheld and, to the extent required, properly paid or deposited.
The Company is not currently and has not been a party to any Tax allocation,
Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax reimbursement agreement or arrangement (other
than any Commercial Tax Agreements). No written claim has been made to Seller
or any Rolling Mill Affiliate (with respect to the Rolling Mill Business) or
the Company by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Seller or any
Rolling Mill Affiliate (with respect to the rolling Mill Business) or the
Company does not file Tax Returns that Seller or such Rolling Mill Affiliate
(with respect to the Rolling Mill Business) or the Company is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. The Company is, and has been at all
times since its formation, validly treated for U.S. federal income Tax

bonus for non-union Transferred Employees, provided that the pre-Closing bonus
accrual for non-union Transferred Employees shall be included in Employee
Amounts. Under the performance pay program in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement, (i) if the Effective Time occurs at the end of any calendar quarter

Transferred Employees,

 except that such Buyer DB Plan will provide for an offset of defined
benefits accrued and vested under the Seller DB Plan. Each union Transferred
Employee who is a participant in the Seller DB Plan immediately prior to the
Closing shall cease to be an active participant in the Seller DB Plan as of
the Closing. Buyer or its Affiliate shall be solely responsible for taking all
necessary, reasonable and appropriate actions (including, if applicable, the
submission of the Buyer DB Plan to the IRS for a determination of tax-
qualified status) to establish, maintain, and administer the Buyer DB Plan so
that it is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and the related trust
is exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code.

(i) _Retiree Welfare and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans_ _._ Effective
as of the Closing, Buyer or its Affiliate shall adopt and establish (or
otherwise designate existing) post-retirement benefit plans for the benefit of
Transferred Employees covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement that
substantially replicate the post-retirement benefit plans of the Seller or its
Affiliates as they pertain to Transferred Employees covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreement. Buyer or its Affiliate shall assume all post-retirement
obligations of Seller and/or its Affiliates for the benefit of Transferred
Employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement, and their respective
spouses and beneficiaries. Seller shall retain the obligations under the
Collective Bargaining Agreement to provide retiree welfare and other post-
employment benefits to any individual who is not a Transferred Employee (other
than spouses or beneficiaries of Transferred Employees) and such obligations
shall not transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) through
the Collective Bargaining Agreement as shall be reflected in the written
agreements contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

 

(j) _Active Health, Welfare and Fringe Plans_. Effective as of the Effective
Time, Buyer shall provide Transferred Employees with health, welfare and
fringe benefits. Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer, to: (i)
waive any limitation on health coverage of Transferred Employees due to pre-
existing conditions, waiting periods, and requirements to show evidence of
good health under any applicable health plan of Buyer, or any their respective
Affiliates to the extent Transferred Employees were covered under a similar
benefit plan of the Company or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
and (ii) to the extent commercially reasonable, credit each Transferred
Employee with all deductible payments and with out-of-pocket maximums paid by
such employee under any health benefit plan of the Company, Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing Date during the year in which
the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which
any Transferred Employee has satisfied any applicable deductible and has
reached the out-of-pocket maximums under any benefit plan of Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates for such year. Seller and the
Company Plans shall retain all health, welfare and fringe benefit claims that
arose or were incurred prior to the Effective Time, including the provision of
any continuing health care coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 for a Transferred Employee or his or her qualified
beneficiary with respect to a qualifying event that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. To the extent that the Closing Date occurs on a date that is
not the calendar year-end, Buyer or its Affiliates will assume that portion of
the Company Plan that is a cafeteria plan that meets the requirements of
Section 125 of the Code and that relates to the provision of medical expense
reimbursement account benefits and dependent care expense reimbursement
account benefits for Transferred Employees. Buyer or its Affiliates agree to
process and honor all elections and eligible medical and dependent care
expenses incurred before and following such Closing Date and to continue such
medical and dependent care expense reimbursement accounts through the end of
the then-current calendar year for Transferred Employees.

 



33

    

Section 5.3. _Labor Matters_. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to,
honor the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with respect to the
Transferred Employees. For the avoidance of doubt, seniority and service
credit for Transferred Employees who are subject to the Collective Bargaining
Agreement shall not be impacted by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Seller will be responsible for timely and properly providing notice
as may be required by the Collective Bargaining Agreement or Law. For
Transferred Employees who are subject to the Collective Bargaining Agreement,
Seller may engage in bargaining with any labor organization representing
employees of the Rolling Mill Business regarding this Agreement, and Seller
and such labor organization may enter into agreements reflecting the outcome
of any such bargaining. Seller shall keep Buyer informed of the status of any
such negotiations, and no agreement reached between Seller and any labor
organization after the date of this Agreement shall result in any additional
costs to Buyer or the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer also may
meet with representatives of the union to discuss Buyers operation of the
Rolling Mill Business and any other matters that Buyer and the union may
mutually agree to discuss, and Seller shall facilitate and provide assistance
as reasonably requested in connection with such discussions. Buyer shall keep
Seller informed of the status of any such negotiations, and no agreement
reached between Buyer and any labor organization after the date of this
Agreement shall result in any additional costs to Seller or any of its
Affiliates.

Section 5.4.  _Publicity_. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate with each
other prior to any public disclosure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. Buyer and Seller agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the terms of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be issued by either Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party, as applicable, except (a) as required by
applicable Law, (b) as required by any listing agreement with or rules of any
applicable national securities exchange, trading market or listing authority
or (c) as may be requested by a Governmental Authority, in which case (in the
cases of clauses (a) through (c) above) the Party required to make the
release or announcement shall allow the other Party reasonable time to review
and comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, to
the extent practicable.

 

Section 5.5. _Further Assurances_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, each Party agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts before and after the Closing Date to take or cause to
be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including, but not limited to, (a)
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Parties; (b) the making of all necessary Governmental Filings required to be
made by either Party or their respective Affiliates in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) the execution and
delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions, as the
other Party hereto may reasonably request in order to implement the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 5.6. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Buyer and its Representatives (as such term is defined in that certain
Letter Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2020, by and between Buyer and Seller
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")) shall treat all nonpublic information
obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer
shall hold and shall cause their respective Affiliates to hold, and shall
each use their commercially reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in strict confidence and not to disclose or release
without the prior written consent of the other Party, any and all
Confidential Information of the other party; _provided_ , that the Parties
may disclose, or may permit disclosure of, Confidential Information (i) to
their respective Representatives who have a need to know such information and
are informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the
same extent as is applicable to the Parties hereto and in respect of whose
failure to comply with such obligations, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be,
will be responsible or (ii) if the Parties hereto, their Affiliates or their
Representatives are compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information by
judicial or administrative process or, in the written opinion of independent
legal counsel (which may be inside counsel), by other requirements of Law or
as required to a recognized security exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that any demand or request for disclosure of Confidential
Information is made pursuant to clause (ii) above, Seller or Buyer, as the
case may be, shall promptly notify the other of the existence of such request
or demand and shall provide the other a reasonable opportunity to seek an
appropriate protective order or other remedy, which both Parties will
reasonably cooperate in obtaining (each at their own expense). In the event
that such appropriate protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the
Party who is required to disclose such Confidential Information shall furnish,
or cause to be furnished, only that portion of the Confidential Information
that is legally required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prevent Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their
respective Representatives from disclosing or using any Confidential
Information used or held for use in connection with any Excluded Business or
Retained Liabilities and nothing shall prevent Buyer or its Subsidiaries
(including the Company) or Affiliates or their respective
Representatives from disclosing or using any Confidential Information solely
used or held for use in connection with any Rolling Mill Assets or Assumed
Liabilities.

 

(c) As used in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, " _Confidential Information_ " shall
mean all proprietary technical, economic, environmental, operational,
financial and/or other business information or material of one Party, which,
prior to or following the Closing Date, has been disclosed by Seller or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or its Affiliates, on the other hand,
in written, oral (including by recording), electronic, or visual form to, or
otherwise has come into the possession of, the other, in each case including
pursuant to the access provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ or any other
provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including (i) ideas
and concepts for existing products, processes and services; (ii)
specifications for products, equipment and processes; (iii) manufacturing
and performance specifications and procedures; (iv) engineering drawings and
graphs; (v) technical, research and engineering data; (vi) formulations and
material specifications; (vii) service and operation manuals; (viii) quality
assurance policies, procedures and specifications; (ix) evaluation and/or
validation studies; (x) all other know-how, methodology, procedures,
techniques and trade secrets related to research, engineering, development
and

 



35

    

 manufacturing; and (xi) business information, including marketing and
development plans, forecasts, research and development agreements, and
customer and vendor information (except to the extent that such information
can be shown to have been (A) in the public domain through no fault of such
Party or its Affiliates or (B) lawfully acquired from other sources by the
Party (or its Affiliates) to which it was furnished; provided, however, in
the case of (B) that such sources did not provide such information in breach
of any confidentiality or other legal obligations).

 

Section 5.7. _Access to Information_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ and
applicable Law, prior to the earlier of the Closing Date and the date on
which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ , upon reasonable
prior written notice by Buyer and solely for purposes of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall afford Buyer
and Buyers Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the officers, directors, employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities (including the Rolling Mill Real Property) and the books
and records of the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by
maintaining Buyers and its Representatives access to the Project Knight
online data room), Seller and the Rolling Mill Affiliates (solely with respect
to the Rolling Mill Business), and shall furnish Buyer, at Buyers expense,
with such existing financial, operating and other data and information with
respect to the Rolling Mill Business, as Buyer may reasonably request in
writing. In exercising its rights hereunder, Buyer shall conduct itself so as
not to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the Rolling Mill Business
prior to Closing. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any contact by Buyer and
its agents and Representatives with officers, employees or agents of the
Company hereunder shall be arranged and supervised by Seller, unless Seller
otherwise expressly consents in writing with respect to any specific contact.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company) shall be required to
disclose to Buyer or any agent or Representative thereof any (i) information
if doing so could reasonably be expected to (A) violate any Contract or Law
to which Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) is a party or
is subject, (B) result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim
of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges), (C)
upon a written opinion of counsel, result in the disclosure of any
competitively sensitive information of Seller or of any of its Affiliates
unrelated to the Rolling Mill Business or that would violate any Law or (D)
breach a confidentiality or other obligation to a Third Party and (ii)
consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return which includes Seller
or any of its Affiliates or any Tax-related work papers, except, in each
case, for materials that relate solely to the Company, the Rolling Mill
Business or the Rolling Mill Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
the Closing, Buyer shall have no right to perform or conduct any
environmental sampling or other invasive environmental investigation on or
about any portion of the Rolling Mill Real Property (or any other real
property) without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). It is further agreed that,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_, prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not
(and shall cause its Representatives not to) contact any of the employees,
customers, distributors, vendors or suppliers of Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Company) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether in person or by telephone, mail or other means of
communication, without the specific prior written consent of Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Prior to
the Closing, Buyer shall not (and shall cause its Representatives not to) use
any information obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ for any
purpose unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Promptly
following the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a CD, USB flash drive or
similar electronic media containing the contents of the online data room as of
the date hereof and any additional content uploaded prior to Closing.

Section 5.8. _Post-Closing Access_.

 

(a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to,
preserve and keep all books and records and other information relating to the
accounting, legal, Tax, regulatory, business and financial affairs of the
Company and the Rolling Mill Business for a period of seven (7) years after
the Closing Date (or, in the case of information relating to Taxes, until
the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations), or for a longer
period if (i) required by Law (including any statute of limitations and
applicable extensions thereof) or any Governmental Authority or (ii)
reasonably necessary with respect to the prosecution or defense of any audit
or other legal or regulatory action that is then pending or threatened so long
as the requesting Party has notified the other Party with prior written notice
of the need to retain such books, records or information.

(b) Following the Closing, for so long as such information is retained by
Buyer in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Company, to permit Seller and its authorized Representatives, at
Sellers sole cost and expense, to have reasonable access and duplication
rights during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior written notice to
Buyer to the information described in _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_ to the extent
that such access may be reasonably required in connection with (i) the
preparation of any Tax Return, accounting records or with respect to any Tax
Claim or similar proceedings, (ii) any Action relating to Seller, the Company
or the Rolling Mill Business, (iii) any Governmental Filing or matter
(including investigations by Governmental Authorities) or (iv) any other
valid legal or business purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall
have no right of access to, and Buyer shall have no obligation to provide, (A)
any information if doing so would reasonably be expected to (1) violate any
Contract or Law to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) is a party or is subject, (2) result in a loss of the ability to
successfully assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and
work product privileges), (3) result in the disclosure of any competitively
sensitive information of Buyer or of any of its Affiliates (including the
Company), or (4) breach a confidentiality or other obligation to a
Third Party (provided that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of any Third Party with regards to such disclosure), or (B)
any consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return which includes
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) or any Tax-related
work papers.

(c) Following the Closing, for so long as such information is retained by
Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_, Seller shall permit Buyer
and its authorized Representatives, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to have
reasonable access and duplication rights during normal business hours, upon
reasonable prior written notice to Seller, to the information described in
_Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_ to the extent that such access may be reasonably
required in connection with (i) the preparation of any Tax Return, accounting
records or with any Tax Claim or similar proceedings, (ii) any Action relating
to the Company or the Rolling Mill Business, (iii) any Governmental Filing or
matter (including investigations by Governmental Authorities) or (iv) any
other valid legal or business purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
shall have no right of access to, and Seller shall have no obligation to
provide, (A) any information if doing so would reasonably be expected to (1)
violate any Contract or Law to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a
party or is subject,

 



37

    

 (2) result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of
privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges), (3)
result in the disclosure of any competitively sensitive information of Seller
or of any of its Affiliates unrelated to the Rolling Mill Business, or (4)
breach a confidentiality or other obligation to a Third Party (provided that
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any
Third Party with regards to such disclosure), or (B) any consolidated,
combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return which includes Seller or any of its
Affiliates or any Tax-related work papers.

Section 5.9. _Appropriate Actions_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties shall (and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to)
use its respective reasonable best efforts promptly to (i) take, or to cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and

actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, waiting period expirations
or terminations, permits or orders required to be obtained by Seller, the
Company, or Buyer or any of their Affiliates in connection with the

Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby in the most expeditious manner practicable, and in any
event no later than the Outside Date; (iii) make all Governmental Filings (in
each case, promptly after the date of this Agreement) which are necessary or
advisable, and thereafter promptly make any other required submissions and
responses, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
required under (A) the HSR Act (such Governmental Filing shall be made no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement; unless
the Parties mutually agree on a later filing date; and provided, that any
failure to make such filing within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement so long as such filing
is made as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter) and no such filing
shall be withdrawn without the other Partys written consent and (B) any other
applicable Law; (iv) furnish to the other Party all information
and assistance as reasonably requested in good faith in connection with the
preparation and submission of any Governmental Filings to be made by such
Party pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions

cooperate with the other Party in connection with any Governmental Filings
(including, to provide counsel for the other party with copies of all
Governmental Filings made by such Party, and all correspondence between such
Party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Authority and any other
information supplied by such Party and such Partys Affiliates to, or received
from, a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby and, if requested by the other Party, to consider in good faith all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other Party); (vi)
keep the other Party informed in all material respects of any
material communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party
to, any Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case,

Agreements, including by promptly informing the other Party of any such
communication and by promptly providing the other Party with copies of all
written communications and filings to or from any Governmental Authority;
(vii) provide the other Party

 



38

    

 with reasonable advance notice of any material communication with, and any
proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental
Authority regarding any such Governmental Filings; (viii) consult and
cooperate, and consider in good faith the views of other Party, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in
connection with proceedings relating to or arising out of such Governmental
Filings; (ix) not participate independently in any meeting or telephone
conference, or engage in any other substantive conversation, with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any such Governmental Filings or any
investigations or other inquiries relating thereto without giving, to the
extent reasonably practicable, the other Party reasonable prior notice of the
meeting or conversation and, unless expressly prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate; (x) avoid the entry of,
or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including vigorously defending any lawsuits

hereby or thereby; and (xi) execute and deliver any additional instruments or
agreements necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in the most expeditious manner
practicable, and in any event no later than the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of any disagreement between the Parties, the
determination of Buyer with respect to strategy with a Governmental Authority
or the content of any submissions to a Governmental Authority shall be final
and conclusive. Without limiting the foregoing, any Party may, as it deems
advisable and necessary, (1) redact materials as necessary to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Rolling Mill Business and all
activities in connection therewith or matters other than the Rolling Mill
Business, (2) as necessary to comply with contractual obligations, and (3)
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other Party under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ as "outside counsel only." Such
("outside counsel only") materials and the information contained therein shall
be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of such materials. Neither Party shall consent to any voluntary delay
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at the request of
any Governmental Authority without the written consent of the other Party.

 

(b) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_, Buyer agrees to take any and all
steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition,
trade regulation or similar Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements so as to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and
in any event, no later than the Outside Date), including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such
assets, properties or businesses of Buyer or the Company or otherwise taking
or committing to take actions that limit Buyers freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain or operate, any of the Rolling Mill
Businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or the
Company, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution or lift of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have
the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of 

 



39

    

 the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing
and for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer will take any and all actions necessary
in order to ensure that no (i) requirement for any non-action, consent or
approval of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice or other Governmental Authority, (ii) decree,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any
suit or proceeding, or (iii) other matter relating to any antitrust or
competition Law would preclude the Closing by the Outside Date.

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _ARTICLE VII_ or
the Closing, except as required by this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), engage in any action or enter
into any transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be
entered into, that could reasonably be expected to prevent, prohibit or
materially delay, hinder or impede the prompt satisfaction of the conditions
to Closing or Buyers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or perform its obligations hereunder. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, none of Buyer, its Subsidiaries, or their respective
Affiliates shall, and shall not cause any Person to, acquire (whether via
merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so
acquire, any material amounts of assets of or any equity in any other Person
or any business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement
would not reasonably be expected to (i) increase the risk of not obtaining (or
delaying the obtaining of) any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations
or approvals of any Governmental Authority, or obtaining (or delaying the
obtaining of) the expiration or termination of any waiting period under any
applicable Law, necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in the most expeditious manner practicable, and in any event no
later than the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the Outside Date; or (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting
or delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or increase the risk of not being able to remove (or delaying the
removal of) any such order on appeal or otherwise.

 

Section 5.10. _Mail and Other Communications; Account_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, each of Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer and
its Affiliates may receive mail, packages and other communications (including
electronic communications) properly belonging to the other (or the others
Affiliates). Accordingly, at all times after the Closing Date, each of Seller
and Buyer authorizes the other and their respective Affiliates to receive
and open all mail, packages and other communications received by it and not
unambiguously intended for the other party (or its Affiliates) or any of the
other partys (or its Affiliates) officers or directors, and to retain the
same to the extent that they relate to the Rolling Mill Business (in the case
of receipt by Buyer and its Affiliates) or the Excluded Businesses (in the
case of receipt by Seller and its Affiliates), or to the extent that they do
not relate to the Rolling Mill Business (in the case of receipt by Buyer and
its Affiliates) or the Excluded Businesses (in the case of receipt by Seller
and its Affiliates), the receiving party shall promptly after becoming aware
thereof refer, forward or otherwise deliver such mail, packages or other
communications (or, in case the same relate to both the Rolling Mill Business
and the Excluded Businesses, copies thereof) to the other party. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are not intended to, and shall not
be deemed to, constitute an authorization by either Seller or Buyer to permit
the other to accept service of process on its behalf, and neither party is or
shall be deemed to be the agent of the other for service of process
purposes. 

 



40

    

(b) All payments and reimbursements received by Seller or its Affiliates in
connection with or arising out of the Rolling Mill Business or the Assumed
Liabilities after the Closing shall be held by such Person in trust for the
benefit of Buyer and, immediately upon receipt by such Person of any such
payment or reimbursement, such Person shall pay over to Buyer the amount of
such payment or reimbursement, without right of set off.

(c) All payments and reimbursements received by Buyer or its Affiliates in
connection with or arising out of the Excluded Assets, Retained Liabilities or
Excluded Businesses, after the Closing shall be held by such Person in trust
for the benefit of Seller and, immediately upon receipt by such Person of any
such payment or reimbursement such person shall pay over to Seller the amount
of such payment or reimbursement without right of set off.

 

Section 5.11. _Compliance with WARN Act and Similar Statutes_. Buyer shall
provide or cause to be provided any required notice under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the " _WARN Act_ "), and
any similar applicable Law, and otherwise to comply with any such applicable
Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or similar event
affecting Transferred Employees and occurring on or after the Closing Date.

Section 5.12.  _Buyer_ __ _s Financing_ _Activities_. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that Seller and its Affiliates (including the Company) have no
responsibility for any financing that Buyer may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any offering materials and other documents
prepared by or on behalf of or utilized by Buyer or its Affiliates, or Buyers
financing sources, in connection with Buyers financing activities in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby which include any
information provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company), including any offering memorandum, bankers book, prospectus or
similar document used, or any other written offering materials used, in
connection with any debt offering or other such Buyer financing shall include
a conspicuous disclaimer to the effect that neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates (including the Company) nor any of its or their employees has any
responsibility for the content of such document and disclaim all
responsibility the content of such document and shall further include a
disclaimer with respect to Seller and its Affiliates in any oral disclosure
with respect to such financing.

Section 5.13. _INTENTIONALLY OMITTED_.

 

Section 5.14. _Termination of Certain Intercompany Agreements and Pre-Closing
Intercompany _ _Balances_. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
effective upon the Closing, terminate all arrangements, commitments and
Contracts between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, except those set forth
in _Schedule_ __ _ 5.14_ (all such terminated arrangements, commitments and
Contracts, collectively, " _Terminating Intercompany Agreements_ "). Seller
shall take (or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to take) such action
as is necessary or advisable to settle all intercompany balances relating to
the period ending on or before the Closing Date between the Company, on the

Sellers estimate of the amount of casualty insurance, if any, payable to
Seller, the Company or their Affiliates in respect thereof, (ii) Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace or repair (as applicable)

promptly file claims under the applicable insurance policies for such
Casualty Loss, and (b) if the Closing is consummated, and if such damaged,
destroyed, stolen or lost tangible assets have not been repaired or replaced
as of the Effective Time, then, without duplication or limitation of Buyers
other rights hereunder, promptly after any casualty or business interruption
insurance proceeds from insurance policies maintained with third-parties
payable to Seller or its Affiliates in excess 

 



42

    

 of self-insured retention amounts and not subject to reimbursement with
respect to such Casualty Loss have been collected, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, pay to Buyer (i) the net amount, if any, of the

any purposes in the calculation of the Net Working Capital.

(c) Effective as of the Closing, but only to the extent determined under
applicable workers compensation Law and the applicable insurance carriers for
the Parties, Buyer and its Affiliates will assume and be responsible for all
workers compensation benefits payable to or on behalf of the Transferred

Representatives and advisors shall contact or communicate with the customers,
suppliers, lessors, and licensors of the Rolling Mill Business in connection

regulations, including any applicable Indiana state regulations, Seller shall
first provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to purchase all or some of
the credits or offsets at a fair market value prior to selling the credits or
offsets to any other party; provided, however, that if the Rolling Mill is the

Section 5.21. _Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) With respect to Shared Contractual Liabilities pursuant to, under or
relating to a given Shared Contract, such Shared Contractual Liabilities
shall, unless otherwise allocated pursuant to this Agreement or an Ancillary
Agreement, be allocated between Seller and Buyer (or the Company, as
applicable) as follows:

 

(i) If a Liability or obligation is incurred exclusively in respect of the
Rolling Mill Business or the Excluded Businesses, such Liability or
obligation shall be allocated to Buyer (in respect of the Rolling Mill
Business) or Seller (in respect of the Excluded Businesses);

 

(ii) If a Liability or obligation cannot be so allocated under clause (i)
above, such Liability or obligation shall be allocated to Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be, based on the relative proportions of total benefit received
(over the term of the Shared Contract remaining as of the Closing Date,
measured as of the date of the allocation) by the Rolling Mill Business or
the Excluded Business under the relevant Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of Seller and Buyer shall be responsible for any or all
Liability or obligation arising from its (or its Subsidiarys) breach of
the relevant Shared Contract to which this _Section_ __ _ 5.21_ otherwise
pertains; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Seller and Buyer shall be
entitled to indemnification from the other for the portion of any Liability
or obligation arising from any breach of the relevant Shared Contract by the
other party (or its Subsidiary), which indemnification shall be separate from
and not subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.7_.

 

(b) If Seller or any Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, receives any benefit or payment which
under any Shared Contract was intended for the other, Seller and Buyer will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to, and to cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, deliver such benefit or payment to the other party.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that
the Shared Contracts listed on _Schedule Section_ __ _ 5.21(c)(i)_ shall not
be deemed to be Rolling Mill Assets hereunder and are Excluded Assets (the "
_Excluded Shared Contracts_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, the parties
have determined that it is advisable that certain Shared Contracts, which are
identified on _Schedule Section_ __ _ 5.21(c)(ii)_, be separated into
separate Contracts between the appropriate Third Party and either the Excluded
Businesses or the Rolling Mill Business. The parties agree to cooperate and
use reasonable best efforts prior to the Closing (with no obligation on the
part of either party to pay any costs or fees with respect to such assistance)
to effect the separation of such Shared Contracts. If such Shared Contracts
are not separated at Closing, the parties agree to continue to provide each
other with reasonable cooperation and assistance in effecting the separation
of such Shared Contracts and shall treat the same as Shared Contracts or take
such reasonable steps as are necessary to provide each party the benefit of
such Shared Contracts.

Section 5.22.  _Obligations Regarding Non-Assignable Assets_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, unless
and until such license, consent, approval or amendment described below is no
longer required or has been obtained, this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense,
lease, sublease, convey or transfer at the Closing any Rolling Mill Assets to
the Company or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom as to

 



46

    

 which consent or approval from any Person (including any and all licenses to
be granted by, and any and all consents and approvals of, Governmental
Authorities) to assignment, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, conveyance
or transfer thereof or amendment thereof is required but has not been obtained
as of the Closing Date (such Rolling Mill Assets, the " _Delayed Transferred
Assets_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , to the extent not inconsistent with the
terms of any Delayed Transferred Assets or applicable Law, the parties shall
treat the Company as the owner thereof for Tax purposes as of the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, neither Seller or any of its Affiliates nor Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall be required to commence any litigation or offer or pay any
money or otherwise grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
Third Party. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ and
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_, Seller and Buyer shall use, and cause each of their
Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
license, consent, approval or amendment, including after the Closing Date.
Upon obtaining the requisite licenses, consents or approvals, unless otherwise
provided in the Transition Services Agreement, such Delayed Transferred
Assets shall be transferred and assigned to the Company hereunder.

(b) In the event and to the extent that, prior to the Closing, Seller or any
of any Retained Subsidiary is unable to obtain a license, consent, approval or
amendment required to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or
transfer any Delayed Transferred Assets to the Company (or to a Subsidiary of
Buyer, if applicable), then following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall
cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to, in
each case, subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, (i)
continue to hold, and to the extent required by the terms applicable to such
Delayed Transferred Assets, operate such Delayed Transferred Asset in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business and taking into account
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) cooperate with Buyer
and the Company in any arrangement, lawful as to Seller and Buyer (or the
Company), designed to provide to Buyer or the Company the benefits arising
under such Delayed Transferred Assets, including accepting such reasonable
direction as Buyer shall request of Seller or its Affiliates, and (iii)
enforce at Buyers request, or allow Buyer and its Affiliates to enforce in a
commercially reasonable manner, any rights of Seller or its Affiliates, as
applicable, under such Delayed Transferred Assets against the other party or
parties thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that documented and reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates at Buyers request shall be
borne by Buyer or its Affiliates, and Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller or
its Affiliates for such costs and expenses. Subject to the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause the Retained
Subsidiaries to pay and remit to Buyer promptly all monies, rights and other
consideration received by Seller or its Subsidiaries directly related to any
such Delayed Transferred Asset due and owing to Buyer or the Company
as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.22_. Subject to the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement, Buyer (or the Company, as applicable) shall
pay, perform and discharge fully, promptly when due, all of the obligations of
Seller or the Retained Subsidiaries in respect of actions taken in compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.22(b)_, and Buyer shall be responsible for all
Assumed Liabilities related thereto and indemnify Seller and Sellers
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,

or any of any Retained Subsidiary arising out of such actions taken in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.22(b)_.

 



47

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.22_, neither Seller nor any other of its Affiliates shall be required to
take any action that may, in the good faith judgment of Seller or such
Affiliate, (i) result in a violation of any obligation which Seller or any
such Affiliate has to any Third Party or (ii) violate applicable Law.

(d) Subject to Seller and its Affiliates performing their obligations pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 5.22(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.22(b)_, Buyer agrees that
Seller and its Affiliates shall not have any liability whatsoever arising out
of or relating to, the failure to obtain any consents, approvals or licenses
that may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default under or acceleration
or termination of any Contracts, Permits or Environmental Permits or other
right or obligation, as a result thereof, other than as provided in _Section_
__ _ 7.2_. Subject to Seller and its Affiliates performing their obligations
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.22(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.22(b)_, Buyer
further agrees that no representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation
of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no
condition to Buyers obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of the failure to
obtain any such consent, approval or license or as a result of any such
default, acceleration or termination.

 

Section 5.23. _Solvency after Closing_. After the Closing, Buyer agrees that
it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take or cause to be
taken or omit to take any action that could result in a determination pursuant
to applicable Law that, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (or after giving effect

result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary

Restructuring_. Seller shall take, or cause one or more of its Affiliates to

provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or
provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the
remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 5.27. _Specified Litigation_.

 

(a) _Seller Actions_. Following the Closing Date, Seller shall have
exclusive authority and control over the investigation, prosecution, defense
and appeal of all then pending or threatened Actions primarily relating to or
arising in connection with the Excluded Businesses, the Excluded Assets or the
Retained Liabilities, including Actions involving the matters set forth on
_Schedule Section_ __ _ 5.27(a)(i)_ (each, a " _Seller Action_ ") but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Assumed Actions, and, to the extent
Seller acknowledges in writing that any Action is a Retained Liability, may
settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
any such Action without the consent of Buyer; provided, however, that (a) if
both Seller (or any of its Subsidiaries) and Buyer (or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Company) are named as parties to any Seller Action
(a " _Joint Action_ ") or (b) if any Seller Action is with a Key Customer, Key
Supplier or any other third party listed on _Schedule Section_ __ _
5.27(a)(ii)_ (such Seller Action, a " _Key Commercial Action_ "), in any such
case of (a) or (b), Seller shall not settle such Joint Action or Key
Commercial Action, as applicable, without the written consent of Buyer (not
to be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement releases Buyer (or such of
its Subsidiaries named as parties) in connection with such Joint Action or Key
Commercial Action, as applicable, and provides relief consisting solely of
money damages borne by Seller (or any of its Subsidiaries) or other relief
which does not have any material impact on the Rolling Mill Business. Buyer
and the Company shall have the opportunity and the right, at their sole cost
and expense, to participate in any discussion, negotiation and settlement
with respect to such Joint Action or Key Commercial Action, which input Seller
shall in good faith consider. Without Sellers prior written consent, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall not communicate regarding any Seller Action with any
Third Party or make any public statement about any Seller Action, in each case
except as required by Law, the rules of any stock exchange or any Governmental
Authority (subject to first consulting with, and considering in good faith
the views of, Seller to the extent legally permissible); _provided_ that

 



51

    

 nothing herein shall prevent Buyer and its Affiliates from having any
communications or discussions with any Third Party that is a party to any
Seller Action listed on _Schedule Section_ __ _ 5.27(a)(i)_ that does not
prejudice Sellers position in the Seller Action and provided further that
Buyer shall keep Seller informed of any such discussions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of ARTICLE VIII shall govern with respect to Tax-
related matters to the extent any provision in ARTICLE VIII is in conflict
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.27(a)_. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company
to, reasonably cooperate with Seller, including by providing Seller and
Sellers legal counsel reasonable access to the Companys employees, records
and documents as Seller may request, to the extent maintained or under
the possession or control of Buyer or the Company and each of their
respective Affiliates. In furtherance of the foregoing, following the Closing,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, make available to Seller, Buyer,
the Companys or each of their respective Affiliates employees to the extent
reasonably requested by Seller for fact finding, consultation and interviews
and as witnesses in connection with the Seller Actions.

 

(b) _Assumed Actions_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall have the right to
control the legal proceedings disclosed on _Schedule 5.27(b)_ (each, an "
_Assumed Action_ "), and at Closing, Buyer shall assume all legal privileges
and protections associated with the Assumed Actions or any related future
legal proceedings. Seller shall, and shall cause the Equity Seller to,
reasonably cooperate with Buyer, including by providing Buyer and Buyers
legal counsel reasonable access to the Equity Sellers employees, records and

the possession or control of Seller or the Equity Seller and each of their
respective Affiliates. In furtherance of the foregoing, following the Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Equity Seller to, make available to Buyer
Sellers, the Equity Sellers or each of their respective Affiliates
employees to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer for fact finding,
consultation and interviews and as witnesses in connection with the Assumed
Actions.

otherwise) for the Rolling Mill Real Property, or grant any consent to any
matter requiring the consent of the Company under any lease, in each case
without the prior written consent of Buyer in Buyers sole discretion (unless

withheld);

from its inventors or other parties having any ownership claim or related
right to any of the Intellectual Property, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide necessary assistance or signatures
to the Company or Buyer to achieve such transfer (and recordation by the
Company thereof), within a timeframe that will not cause Buyer or the Company
to incur extension of time costs and penalties. Following the Closing, Buyer
shall be principally responsible for preparing such documents to change
ownership to the Company and any other documents with respect to actions
requested by Buyer in connection with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.30_. Until such
time after Closing as Buyer completes the assignments and registration of the

registrations and applications for the Rolling Mill IP assigned in connection
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.30_ (for which Buyer shall use commercially

Affiliates and its and its Affiliates respective Representatives to refrain,
from taking, directly or indirectly, any action (a) to solicit or initiate the

Rolling Mill Affiliate relating to the arising out of any of the Rolling Mill
Assets, including any Indiana EDGE incentives or property Tax abatements,
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to notify any applicable
state and local Governmental Authority of the contemplated change in ownership
of the Rolling Mill Assets. Prior to and following the Closing, Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with Buyer and
the Company in transferring (to the extent transferable) such Tax credits and
incentives and, to the extent not transferable, cooperate with Buyer so that
the Company may enter into new Tax credit or incentive arrangements
in connection with its ownership of the Rolling Mill Assets upon the Closing.
__

Mill Business and accompanying notes to such financial statements
(collectively, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "), accompanied by an
unqualified audit report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent

of the Rolling

 



55

    

 Mill Business, and accompanying notes to such financial statements (if
required) (collectively, the " _Interim Financial Statements_ "), in each case
of (i) and (ii) prepared as carve-out financial statements, in accordance
with GAAP for the dates and periods as required by, and in accordance with
Regulation S-X, which will be audited in accordance with AICPA standards; and
(B) cause the Independent Auditor to cooperate with Buyer consistent with
their customary practice, including by providing customary consents to the
inclusion of audit reports in any reports filed or furnished by Buyer with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "). Seller
agrees to provide Buyer with an opportunity to review and comment on drafts of
the Audited Financial Statements and Interim Financial Statements, the form
and substance of which shall be reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and with
reasonable access to the books, records and personnel of the Rolling Mill
Business and Seller and all documents, schedules and work papers that
are reasonably necessary for purposes of such review. Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer regarding other financial information relating to the
Rolling Mill Business that may be required in connection with any filing with
the SEC by Buyer after the Closing.

Section 5.35. _Additional Covenants_. The Parties shall comply with the
covenants set forth on _Schedule 5.35_.

Section 5.36. _Settlement of Metal Hedge Positions_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the metal hedges associated with the
Rolling Mill Business with settlement dates following the Closing Date will be
settled as between Seller and Buyer in the following fashion:

 

(a) Seller shall provide Buyer a full open position schedule of the metal
hedges associated with the Rolling Mill Business with settlement dates
following the Closing Date in the form of _Schedule 5.36_ (the " _Metal Hedge
Positions_ ") as of the following dates: (i) no later than the close of
business as of thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
no later than the close of business as of two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) Each of the Metal Hedge Positions will be valued as at the close of
business on the Closing Date, as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.36(b)_.
Metal values will be determined in U.S. dollars according to the London Metal
Exchange (" _LME_ ") official closing price forward curve for primary
aluminum (3rd Wednesday Dates), as published by the LME and the Aluminum MW
U.S. Transaction Premium Platts Futures Settlements, as published by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange each as of the Closing Date.

(c) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver
to the Buyer a statement of the settlement amount to be paid for the net
valuation gain or loss (the " _Preliminary Hedging Calculation_ "). The
Preliminary Hedging Calculation shall be subject to Buyers review and
reasonable approval, and the Preliminary Hedging Calculation as so approved by
Buyer (or as modified by agreement of Seller and Buyer) shall be the " _Final
Hedging Calculation_ ". Seller shall timely provide to Buyer such supporting
document as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with Buyers review of
the Preliminary Hedging Calculation, and Buyer may make inquiries of Seller
regarding Buyers questions concerning or disagreements with Sellers
Preliminary Hedging Calculations. Seller shall, in good faith, consider
Buyers comments, and to the extent the Parties disagree with respect to the
Preliminary Hedging Calculation, the Parties shall resolve such disagreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.36(d)_. The Metal Hedge

 



56

    

 Positions reflected in the Preliminary Hedging Calculation and the Final
Hedging Calculation shall be determined based on the calculations as set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 5.36(b_) (without taking into account the amount of any
margin or collateral that may have been in place with respect to any
position). If the Final Hedging Calculation reflects a net valuation loss,
such amount will be owed by the Buyer to the Seller. If the Final Hedging
Calculation reflects a net valuation gain, such amount will be owed by the
Seller to the Buyer. The net valuation gain or loss due, as the case may be,
will be paid by Seller or Buyer, respectively, when the Final Closing
Adjustment is paid (or, in the event that no Final Closing Adjustment is owed
by Seller or Buyer, then when it would have been paid had an amount been owed
by one Party to the other) pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.4_. The amount due
hereunder will be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the Party receiving such funds.

 

(d) Should Buyer elect to replace the Metal Hedge Positions by entering into
new metal hedges with third-parties on or prior to Closing, Seller agrees to
provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer in support of Buyers objective to
minimize its cost and exposure in connection therewith. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer shall be solely responsible for any such new metal hedges which
it elects to enter into.

(e) The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement with
respect to any matters in dispute in respect of this _Section_ __ _ 5.36_,
including any dispute that the calculation of the net valuation gain or loss,
as applicable, is mathematically incorrect.

 

(f) For the purposes of calculating the Final Closing Adjustment under
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_, Net Working Capital shall exclude any amounts with
respect to Metal Hedge Positions.

(g) For clarity, the Rolling Mill Business may continue to enter into
metal hedges in the ordinary course of business until Closing.

preceding sentence;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if written notice of a
claim for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_ is provided to Seller
in good faith within the applicable survival period describing such claim in
reasonable detail (including the facts underlying each particular claim) and
including copies of all material written evidence upon which such claim is
based, then the indemnification rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)
_that would otherwise terminate as set forth above shall survive as to such
claim, and that claim only, until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved.

 



60

    

(c) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the amount of any such Taxes that shall be apportioned to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income,
or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended on (and
included) the Closing Date; and

(ii) in the case of all other Taxes deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire period, and when the actual amounts
become known for the current period, such apportionment shall be recalculated
by Buyer and Seller, and Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall promptly
(but not later than five business days after notice of payment due) make any
additional payment or refund so that the correct prorated amount is paid by
each of Buyer and Seller.

(d) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, Seller and Buyer shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to terminate the taxable year of the Company
on the Closing Date. To the extent any such taxable year is terminated on the
Closing Date, the Parties hereto agree to cause the Company to file all Tax
Returns for the period including the Closing Date on the basis that the
relevant taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
unless the relevant taxing authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on
that basis.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary: (i)
Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party for any
Tax (including any reduction in, or loss of, any Tax benefits) of the Company
for any Post-Closing Tax Periods, except to the extent attributable to a
breach of the representation contained in the last sentence of  _Section_ __
_ 3.11_, and (ii) no provision in this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be interpreted in
any manner that will require Seller to pay any amount more than once as an
indemnity or as a set-off or credit against any amounts required to be paid
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 8.2. _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all required Tax Returns of
the Company for any taxable period which ends on or before the Closing Date;
provided, that all such Tax Returns shall be prepared and all elections with
respect to such Tax Returns shall be made in a manner consistent with past
practice. Before filing any Tax Return described in the preceding sentence,
Seller shall provide Buyer for its review and comment a copy of such Tax
Return at least forty-five (45) Business Days prior to the last date for
timely filing such Tax Return (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof)
in the case of income Tax Returns and as soon as practicable in the case of
all other Tax Returns. If Buyer agrees with such Tax Return, Seller shall pay
to Buyer

 



61

    

 the amount of the Buyer Indemnified Parties indemnification prior to such
Tax Return or the due date for the filing of the related Tax Return. If, for
any reason, Buyer does not agree with such Tax Return, Buyer shall notify
Seller of its disagreement within twenty (20) Business Days of receiving a
copy of the Tax Return. In the event that Seller and Buyer do not resolve such
dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter, such dispute shall be
settled pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.5_. Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be filed all
required Tax Returns relating to the Company for taxable periods ending after
the Closing Date; provided, that with respect to any Tax Returns for a
Straddle Period, such Tax Returns shall be prepared and all elections with
respect to such Tax Returns shall be made in a manner consistent with past
practice. Before filing any Tax Return with respect to any Straddle Period,
Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of such Tax Return for its review and
comment at least forty-five (45) Business Days prior to the last date for
timely filing such Tax Return (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof)
in the case of income Tax Returns and as soon as practicable in the case of
all other Tax Returns, accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable
detail Sellers indemnification obligation, if any, pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.1(a)_. If Seller agrees with such Tax Return and Buyers calculation of
its indemnification obligation, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties indemnification prior to such Tax Return or the due
date for the filing of the related Tax Return. If, for any reason, Seller does
not agree with such Tax Return or Buyers calculation of Sellers
indemnification obligation, Seller shall notify Buyer of its disagreement
within twenty (20) Business Days of receiving a copy of the Tax Return and
Buyers calculation. In the event that Seller and Buyer do not resolve such
dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter, such dispute shall be
settled pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.5_.

(b) With respect to Tax Returns that Seller is required to prepare or cause
to be prepared pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, Seller shall pay or cause
to be paid to Buyer when due and payable all Taxes with respect to the Company
for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent
such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, specifically accrued or specifically
reserved for such Taxes in Net Working Capital.

 

(c) With respect to Taxes for Straddle Periods, to the extent that the sum of
(i) payments, if any, made by Seller or the Company prior to the Closing Date
to a Governmental Authority plus (ii) the amount of any liability for Taxes
for Straddle Periods that are specifically accrued for such Taxes in Net
Working Capital is greater than Sellers allocable portion of such Straddle
Period Taxes as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_, Buyer shall
pay to Seller the amount of such excess within ten (10) Business Days of
filing such Straddle Period Tax Return.

 

(d) With respect to a Tax (other than for a Straddle Period) for which Seller
has provided an indemnity under  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_, to the extent that
the amount, if any, specifically accrued or reserved for any such Taxes in Net
Working Capital exceeds the amount of such Taxes actually due and payable,
Buyer shall pay Seller the amount of such excess within ten (10) Business
Days of filing the Tax Return related to such Tax.

Section 8.3. _Tax Refunds_. Except for any refunds or credits of Taxes
attributable to the carryback of a net operating loss or other Tax attribute
generated in a Post-Closing Tax Period and any prepaid Taxes or Tax
receivables specifically included in Net Working Capital, any refunds or
credits of Taxes (including interest received with respect thereto) of the
Company for any Pre-

 



62

    

 Closing Tax Period (including refunds or credits of Taxes arising by reason
of amended Tax Returns of the Company filed after the Closing Date) received
by the Company, Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates shall be for the account
of Seller and the amount of such refunds or credits of Taxes (net of all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, including Taxes, imposed on Buyer or the
Company with respect to such refunds or credits of Taxes) shall be paid by
Buyer to Seller within ten (10) Business Days after the Company, Buyer or any
of Buyers Affiliates receives such refund or after the relevant Tax Return
is filed in which the credit is applied against the Companys, Buyers or any
of its Affiliates liability for Taxes. At the request of Seller and at
Sellers expense, with respect to any refund or credit of Taxes of the
Company for which Seller is entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, the
Company, Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates shall file for and obtain any
refunds or credits of Taxes to which Seller may be entitled under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_.

Section 8.4. _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) If a Tax Claim shall be made in writing by a Governmental Authority, or
Buyer intends to initiate any Tax Claim, that, if successful, might result in
an indemnity payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_, Buyer shall notify
Seller in writing of such Tax Claim within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
receipt of such Tax Claim or fifteen (15) Business Days prior to initiating
such Tax Claim. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given to Seller within such
period or in detail sufficient to apprise Seller of the nature of the Tax
Claim then, to the extent that Seller is materially prejudiced as a
result thereof, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_.

(b) Seller shall have the right to control all proceedings and may make any
decisions in connection with a Tax Claim which relates exclusively to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and for which Seller may be required to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_, _provided_
Seller provides written notice of its intent to assume the defense of such
claim within fifteen (15) Business Days of the receipt of the notice required
under _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_, and acknowledges in writing its unconditional
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer __ Indemnified Parties
from and against all Taxes ultimately determined to be payable with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to such Tax Claim. In the event Seller
has not assumed the defense of such Tax Claim by providing such notice and
acknowledgement and subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(f)_, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may, at Sellers expense, (but only with respect to any Tax Claim that
relates exclusively to any Pre-Closing Tax Period), assume the defense of any
Tax Claim for which Seller has sole liability. If Seller does not assume the
defense of any Tax Claim or such Tax Claim does not relate exclusively to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may defend the same in
such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to,
settling, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
not settle such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ and except as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(f)_, in the event of a Tax Claim that involves issues (A)
relating to a potential adjustment for which Seller has liability and (B)
that are required to be dealt with in a proceeding that also involves separate
issues that could affect the Taxes of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, solely to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, (x) Seller shall have the right
at its expense to control the Tax Claim but only with respect to the former
issues and (y) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right at its
expense to control the Tax Claim but only with respect to the latter issues.

 



63

    

(d) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(f)_, with respect to all other
Tax Claims, Buyer (or the Company that is directly or indirectly affected by
such Tax Claim) shall have the right to control the conduct of such
proceedings.

 

(e) The party that is controlling the Tax Claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.4(b)_, _(c)_ or _(d)_ (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall provide the non-
Controlling Party with notice reasonably in advance of any proceedings in
connection with such Tax Claim and, except as provided in  _Section_ __ _
8.4(f)_ and to the extent permitted by Law, the non-Controlling Party shall
have the right, at its expense, to participate in such Tax Claim (including
the right to attend any meetings with a Governmental Authority or hearings or
proceedings before any Governmental Authority to the extent they relate to
such Tax Claim).

 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in
any Tax Claim relating to any consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary
Tax Return which includes Seller or any of its Affiliates and none of Seller
or any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in any Tax
Claim relating to any consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax
Return which includes Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall notify Buyer to the extent any such
Tax Claim involves any issues that could materially adversely affect Buyer or
any of their Affiliates (including the Company) and will inform and discuss
with Buyer how Seller is addressing and contesting such issues and will
consider and act in good faith with respect to such issues.

Section 8.5. _Tax Dispute Resolution_. Except as otherwise provided, with
respect to any dispute or a disagreement relating to Taxes between the
Parties, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute
between them; _provided_ that if the Parties are unable to resolve such
dispute, the Parties shall submit the dispute to the Independent Accounting
Firm for resolution, which resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties. The fees and expenses relating to any dispute as to the amount
of Taxes owed by either of the Parties shall be paid by Buyer and Seller in
proportion to each Partys respective liability for the portion of the Taxes
in dispute, as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm.

 

Section 8.6. _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible
for and shall pay one half of all Transfer Taxes. The Party that is legally
required to file Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes shall file all
such Tax Returns, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, to join in the execution of such Tax Returns.
To the extent one Party files such Tax Returns and pays any Transfer Taxes,
the other Party shall indemnify and, within ten (10) Business Days of a
written request therefor, reimburse the first Party for one half of any such
Transfer Taxes and the first Partys out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns.

Section 8.7. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any payment required to be made
pursuant to this Agreement following the Closing Date shall be treated, for
Tax purposes, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required
by Law, and the Parties hereto shall file their Tax Returns consistent with
such treatment and shall take no position contrary thereto in any audit or
other Tax proceeding.

 



64

    

Section 8.8. _Exclusivity_. _ARTICLE VIII_ shall govern all
matters, including indemnification claims, with respect to Taxes.

ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 9.1. _Survival_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Taxes which shall be governed by the provisions of
_ARTICLE VIII_ , the representations and warranties in  _ARTICLE III_ and
_ARTICLE IV_ , and the right to commence any claim with respect thereto, shall
survive the Closing until, and terminate on, the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, except that (i) the
Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental Representations shall
survive the Closing indefinitely and shall not terminate; (ii) representations
and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.15_ _(Employee Benefit Plans)_
 and _Section_ __ _ 3.18(a)_ _(subclause (a) Title to Assets) _in each
case, shall survive the Closing and thereupon terminate on the three (3) year
anniversary of the Closing Date, (iii) the representations and warranties
contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.17_ _(Environmental Matters)_ shall survive the
Closing and thereupon terminate on the four (4) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (iv) the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.11_ _(Taxes)_ shall survive the Closing and shall thereupon
terminate upon thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations.

 

(b) If the Closing has occurred, all covenants and agreements contained herein
that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part, or that prohibit
actions, subsequent to the Closing Date shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms. Claims with respect to breaches of all other
covenants and agreements contained herein shall survive the Closing and shall
thereupon terminate on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing
Date, provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt (x) the obligations
of Buyer to assume, and to indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties for, the
Assumed Liabilities and (y) the obligations of Seller to retain, and
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties for the Retained Liabilities shall in each
case survive the Closing indefinitely.

 

(c) Any claim for indemnity under this Agreement with respect to any breach of
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements not made within the
periods specified in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b) _shall
be deemed time-barred, and no such claim shall be made after the periods
specified in  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_; _provided_
, _however_ , that if written notice of a claim for indemnification under
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)(i)_ shall have been
provided to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, within the applicable
survival period and in good faith with reasonable specificity, then any
representations or warranties that are the subject of such indemnification
claim that otherwise would terminate as set forth above shall survive as to
such claim, and that claim only, until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

 



65

    

Section 9.2. _Obligations of Seller_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Taxes which shall be governed by the provisions of
_ARTICLE VIII_ , from and after the Closing, subject to the terms of this
_ARTICLE IX_ , Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and Buyers
Affiliates (including the Company) and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and Representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against out-of-pocket losses, damages,
Liabilities, claims, fines, awards, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), interest, penalties, disbursements, judgments and
settlements (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred by any Buyer Indemnified
Party arising from: (i) any breach of any of the representations
or warranties of Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) the failure of Seller
to duly perform or observe any covenant, agreement or obligation to be
performed or observed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) any of
the Retained Liabilities.

(b) The obligation of Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
Losses is subject to the following limitations: (i) Seller shall not be
required to provide indemnification to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by
all the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of all claims against Seller for
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ exceeds $5,695,000 (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for only the amount in excess of the Deductible, and (ii) in
no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller is obligated to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(i)_ exceed $67,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, in no event shall Seller be required to provide indemnification to
any Buyer Indemnified Party for any single claim or aggregated claims arising
out of substantially the same events or circumstances under _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(i)_ unless the amount of such claim exceeds $250,000 (the " _De Minimis
Claim Threshold_ "). 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, none of the
Deductible, the Cap nor the De Minimis Claim Threshold shall apply to any
claim involving Losses to the extent arising out of or relating to a breach of
any Fundamental Representation or any claim involving Losses resulting from
fraud.

 

Section 9.3. _Obligations of Buyer_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this _ARTICLE IX_ , from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from
and against Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party arising from: (i)
any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Seller pursuant
to this Agreement; (ii) the failure of Buyer to duly perform or observe any
covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed or observed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) in the event Buyer has not delivered, to
Seller a release as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ with respect to any
Seller Guaranty, failure by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company) to perform the obligations secured thereby; and (iv) any
of the Assumed Liabilities.

(b) The obligation of Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for
Losses is subject to the following limitations: (i) Buyer shall not be
required to provide indemnification to any Seller Indemnified Party pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_ unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred
by all the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of all claims against Seller
for

 



66

    

 indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_ exceeds the Deductible, and
then the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for
only the amount in excess of the Deductible, and (ii) in no event shall the
aggregate amount of Losses for which Buyer is obligated to indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_ exceed the
Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in no event shall Buyer be
required to provide indemnification to any Seller Indemnified Party for any
single claim or aggregated claims arising out of substantially the same events
or circumstances under  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)(i)_ unless the amount of such
claim exceeds the De Minimis Claim Threshold.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, none of the
Deductible, the Cap nor the De Minimis Claim Threshold shall apply to any
claim involving Losses to the extent arising out of or relating to a breach of
any Buyer Fundamental Representation. 

Section 9.4. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that any Action is threatened or commenced by a Third Party
involving a claim for which a party may be required to provide indemnity (an
" _Indemnifying Party_ ") to any other party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
hereunder (an " _Asserted Liability_ "), the Indemnified Party promptly shall
notify the Indemnifying Party of such Asserted Liability in a writing that
(i) describes such Asserted Liability in reasonable detail (including the
facts underlying each particular claim and an identification of particular
sections of this Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is being
sought); (ii) attaches copies of any material written evidence upon which such
Asserted Liability is based ( _provided_ that to the extent such written
evidence is not reasonably available at such time, the Indemnified Party
shall so indicate, and shall promptly provide such evidence when it becomes
available); and (iii) sets forth, to the extent possible, the estimated amount
of Losses for which the Indemnified Party may be liable (the " _Claim Notice_
"); _provided_ that no delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party
in giving any Claim Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
indemnification obligation hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay or failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall have forty-five (45) days from its receipt of a Claim
Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party whether the
Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense
and by counsel of its own choosing, to assume and control the defense of an
Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to assume and control
the defense of an Asserted Liability, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall defend
against such Asserted Liability and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to any
settlement that (A) does not contain a full release of the Indemnified Party
from the subject matter of the settlement, (B) requires an express admission
of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or (C) provides for injunctive or
other non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of an
Asserted Liability and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party if (1) such Asserted Liability relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation, (2) the primary objective of such Asserted
Liability is to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, (3) the Indemnified Partys potential Losses in excess of
the Cap are reasonably expected to significantly exceed the Indemnifying
Partys potential indemnification obligations hereunder, (4) the Indemnifying
Party does not agree in writing that it would be obligated to pay all Losses
arising from or related to such 

 



67

    

 Asserted Liability if such claim was valid and indemnifiable, or (5) such
Asserted Liability relates to an alleged violation of Environmental Laws that
would reasonably be expected to materially affect the Indemnified Partys
then current business, operations or real property; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel
(but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party) and participate in the defense of such Asserted Liability
and the Indemnified Party shall not consent to any settlement of such Asserted
Liability without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the
Indemnifying Party undertakes to assume and control the defense of an Asserted
Liability, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel in the investigation, defense and settlement thereof,
including (x) procuring potential witnesses and witness statements, (y)
promptly furnishing documentary evidence to the extent available to it or
its Affiliates and (z) providing access to any other relevant party,
including any Representatives of the parties as reasonably needed, to ensure
the proper and adequate defense of an Asserted Liability. The Indemnified
Party may participate in, but not control, any proceeding with counsel of the
Indemnified Partys choice at the Indemnified Partys expense. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in any event, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
settle any Asserted Liability that the Indemnifying Party shall have
undertaken to defend; _provided_ that in the event that the Indemnified Party
exercises its right to settle an Asserted Liability, then the Indemnified
Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right to indemnification by
the Indemnifying Party with respect to the Asserted Liability; _provided_ ,
_further_ that the Indemnified Party unconditionally releases the Indemnifying
Party from any and all liabilities as part of any such settlement.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party (i) does not undertake within the Notice Period
to assume and control the defense of an Asserted Liability or (ii) after
assuming the defense of an Asserted Liability, fails to prosecute or withdraws
from the defense, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control
the investigation, defense and settlement of the Asserted Liability at the
Indemnifying Partys expense. In the case of clause (i) of the preceding
sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in any
such defense at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall not consent to any settlement of an Asserted Liability
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If
an Indemnified Party settles an Asserted Liability it is defending pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_ without obtaining the Indemnifying Partys
prior written consent to such settlement in violation of the
immediately preceding sentence, then the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved
of its indemnification obligations hereunder in respect of such Asserted
Liability.

 

(c) In the event that any Indemnified Party has a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE IX_ for Losses not involving a claim
by a Third Party that such Indemnified Party believes gives rise to a claim
for indemnification in accordance with the terms hereunder, the Indemnified
Party promptly shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim in a writing
that (i) describes such claim in reasonable detail (including the facts
underlying such claim and an identification of particular sections of this
Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is being sought); (ii) attaches
copies of any material written evidence upon which such claim is based (
_provided_ that to the extent such written evidence is not reasonably
available at such time, the Indemnified Party shall so indicate, and shall
promptly provide such evidence when it becomes available); and (iii) sets
forth, to the extent possible, the estimated amount of Losses for which the

 



68

    

 Indemnifying Party may be liable; _provided_ that no delay or failure on the
part of the Indemnified Party in giving any notice pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 9.4(c)_ shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification
obligation hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such delay or failure.

 

Section 9.5. _Sole Remedy_. Subject to _ARTICLE VIII_ , after the Closing, the
provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy (other than injunctive relief or specific performance as contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 10.11_) of the Parties against each other with respect to
any breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty, agreement,
covenant, condition or any other obligation contained in this Agreement or in
any certificates or similar documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement.
In furtherance of the foregoing, except for claims arising from common law
fraud or intentional misconduct, each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and
causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that
it may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any Law
(including any such Law relating to environmental matters (including
Environmental Laws) or arising under or based upon any securities Law, common
Law or otherwise). The obligations of the Parties set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_ shall be conditioned upon the Closing having occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall either
Party, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or
seek rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 9.5_ shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any remedy
on account of fraud by any Party.

Section 9.6. _Mitigation_. Each of the Seller Indemnified Parties and Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
claim or liability that it asserts or is reasonably likely to assert under
this _ARTICLE IX_. In the event that a Seller Indemnified Party or a Buyer
Indemnified Party shall fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any such claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall not
be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified
Party, as applicable, for that portion of any Losses that would have been
avoided if all Seller Indemnified Parties or Buyer Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, had made such efforts.

 

Section 9.7. _Materiality Scrape; Damages Limitation_.

 

(a) Solely in connection with _ARTICLE IX_ , for purposes of determining the
occurrence of a breach of any representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement (except
for the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ (
_Financial Statements_ ), the first sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 3.8_ (
_Absence of Certain Changes_ ) and _Section_ __ _ 3.12(a)_ ( _Material
Contracts_ )) or the amount of Losses resulting from a breach of any
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, all qualifications as to
"materiality", "material", "in all material respects", "materially adverse" or
"Material Adverse Effect" contained therein shall not be given effect.

 



69

    

(b) In no event shall Seller or Buyer be liable under this _ARTICLE IX_ for
any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, indirect or consequential
damages of any kind or nature (other than as payable to a Third Party in
connection with an Asserted Liability), and in no event shall Seller or Buyer
be liable under this  _ARTICLE IX_ for lost profits, opportunity costs, or
loss of business reputation, except in the case of lost profits to the extent
constituting direct damages.

 

(c) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount of any
indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss
for which an indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any
other representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed
net of (i) payments actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under
any insurance policy with respect to such Losses less the amount of any
increases in premiums attributable to such claim, and (ii) any prior or
subsequent recovery by the Indemnified Party from any Third Party with respect
to such Losses. Nothing herein shall require an Indemnified Party to seek to
recover Losses from a Third Party (including an insurance company) before or
after making a claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE IX_.

 

(d) Where one and the same set of facts qualifies under more than one
provision entitling a party to a claim or remedy under this Agreement, there
shall be only one claim or remedy. In particular, the foregoing shall apply if
one and the same set of facts would entitle Buyer to rights under this
_ARTICLE IX_ and a Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.4_ or with respect to Taxes pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_. For avoidance of
doubt, it is agreed that Buyer shall not be entitled to seek indemnification
under _ARTICLE IX_ for claims relating to any asset or liability within the
categories included within Net Working Capital to the extent such claims were
considered in the resolution of the Dispute Notice or are reflected in the
Final Settlement Statement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.4_. Buyers sole
remedy with respect to any matters related to Taxes shall be as provided in
_ARTICLE VIII_.

 

(e) To the extent that Seller makes any payment pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_
in respect of Losses for which Buyer or any of its Affiliates have a right to
recover against a non-insurer Third Party, Seller shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to the right of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to seek
and obtain recovery from such Third Party, and Buyer or its Affiliates, as
applicable, shall execute any reasonably required papers and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to secure such rights of recovery to allow
Seller to seek recovery from such Third Party on Sellers behalf at Sellers
expense.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Sellers
indemnity obligation pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ with respect to any
breach of Sellers representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.17_ _(Environmental Matters)_ shall be subject to the following
limitations:

(i) if the cost of Cleanup or for correcting a non-compliance with the
Environmental Law subject to indemnity by Seller is increased after the
Closing due to any unreasonable act of a Buyer Indemnified Party or any of
their respective employees, agents, consultants or representatives, Seller
shall not be responsible for any such increase in costs incurred;

 



70

    

(ii) Seller shall not be responsible for any costs, including costs
of Cleanup and for corrective actions, to the extent such costs are incurred
due to (1) any change of use of a real property from industrial use to
commercial or residential use; or (2) implementation of any Cleanup or
corrective action by any Buyer Indemnified Party that is not conducted in a
manner reasonably designed to achieve the least stringent applicable
remediation standards in a commercially reasonable manner (including the use
of any engineering or institutional controls authorized under Environmental
Laws and that do not materially interfere with the operations of the Rolling
Mill Business or on the Rolling Mill Real Property); and

 

(iii) Seller shall not be responsible for costs of Cleanup, corrective action
or other Losses arising out of intrusive environmental sampling conducted by,
on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party, except to the extent any such
environmental sampling was (1) required by any applicable Environmental Law or
Environmental Permit or to respond to an unsolicited Order or other directive
of a Governmental Authority, (2) reasonably necessary or prudent to respond to
an Environmental Claim, (3) reasonably necessary to address a threat to human
health or safety from a Release of Hazardous Materials, (4) in connection
with environmental conditions observed during the course of legitimate work
undertaken to repair equipment or facilities, or to expand or modify
operations for legitimate business purposes, in a manner reasonably designed
to minimize the disturbance of environmental media, (5) reasonably necessary
to complete Cleanup to address a condition identified after the Closing Date
that is subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement pursuant to a
voluntary cleanup program established by a Governmental Authority, (6)
authorized by or required to comply with a provision of the Ground Lease, or
(7) agreed to by Seller.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Buyers
indemnity obligation pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ with respect to any of
the Assumed Environmental Liabilities shall be subject to the following
limitations:

 

(i) if the cost of Cleanup or for correcting a non-compliance with the
Environmental Law subject to indemnity by Buyer is increased after the
Closing due to any unreasonable act of a Seller Indemnified Party or any of
their respective employees, agents, consultants or representatives, Buyer
shall not be responsible for any such increase in costs incurred;

(ii) Buyer shall not be responsible for any costs, including costs of Cleanup
and for corrective actions, to the extent such costs are incurred due to (1)
any change of use of a real property from industrial use to commercial or
residential use; or (2) implementation of any Cleanup or corrective action by
any Seller Indemnified Party that is not conducted in a manner reasonably
designed to achieve the least stringent applicable remediation standards in a
commercially reasonable manner (including the use of any engineering or
institutional controls authorized under Environmental Laws); and

 



71

    

(iii) Buyer shall not be responsible for costs of Cleanup, corrective
action or other Losses arising out of intrusive environmental sampling
conducted by, on behalf of any Seller Indemnified Party, except to the extent
any such environmental sampling was (1) required by any applicable
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit or to respond to an unsolicited
Order or other directive of a Governmental Authority, (2) reasonably necessary
or prudent to respond to an Environmental Claim, (3) reasonably necessary to

Section 10.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
(upon execution of the same) and the Seller Disclosure Schedules collectively
constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous correspondence, agreements, understandings, negotiations and
contracts between the Parties, both written and oral, express or implied,
with respect to such subject matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
Agreement shall not supersede the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall survive and remain in effect until expiration or
termination thereof in accordance with its terms or this Agreement.

Section 10.4.  _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such term or provision to any Person or circumstance
shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable as a matter of law or public
policy in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of

circumstances shall remain in full force and effect so long as, after
excluding the portion deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated to the greatest extent practicable in
substantially the same manner as originally set forth at the later of the date
this Agreement was executed or last amended.

Section 10.5. _Assignment; Binding Effect; Subsequent Sale of Rolling
Mill Business_. This Agreement shall be binding on and shall inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise provided herein, (a) neither Party
may assign, transfer, hypothecate, novate, mortgage, charge or otherwise
convey its rights, benefits, obligations or duties hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Party; (b) any such purported assignment,
transfer, hypothecation, novation, mortgage, charge or other conveyance by
either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party shall be
void _ab initio_ ; and (c) no assignment permitted or consented to hereby
shall release either Party from any liability under this Agreement unless
expressly provided for in such consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
may assign its rights and obligations to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer,
but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder.
Without limiting the foregoing, for three (3) years following the Closing
Date, without the prior written consent of Seller (in its sole discretion),
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates, to sell,
transfer, lease or otherwise divest to any Person (or group) that is not an

indirectly (through a sale of ownership interests, assets, merger,
consolidation or other transaction) of the Company or (ii) a majority of the

Seller that such item (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable
or greater significance) represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance, that such item has had, or is expected to result in, a Material
Adverse Effect, or that such item actually constitutes noncompliance with, or
a violation of, any Law, Permit or Contract or other topic to which such
disclosure is applicable.

this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such
period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business
Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.

 

(l) References to any period of time ending on the Closing Date shall refer to

Rolling Mill Affiliates (in respect of the Rolling Mill Business)" or any

each other Section of such Seller Disclosure Schedules to which it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure would
apply or qualify.

 

Section 10.9. _Waiver and Amendment_.

 

(a) No amendment, modification or variation, of any provision of this
Agreement shall in any event be effective except by written agreement making
specific reference to the applicable provision to be amended, modified or
varied, in each case duly executed by each Party.

performance by the other Party of any provision of this Agreement shall not
waive, affect or diminish any right of such Party thereafter to demand strict
compliance and performance herewith and no failure or delay by a Party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Any suspension or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall
not suspend, waive or affect any other provision of this Agreement whether the
same is prior or subsequent thereto. None of the undertakings, agreements,

suspension or waiver.

 

Section 10.10. _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns, and,
except with respect to Indemnified Parties pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ , nothing
herein express or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person not
a party to this Agreement (including any Affiliates or any employee or former
employee of the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) not party to this Agreement) and such
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

 

Section 10.11. _Specific Performance and Other Equitable Relief_. The Parties
hereby expressly recognize and acknowledge that immediate, extensive and
irreparable damage would result, no adequate remedy at Law would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine in the event that any provision of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms
or otherwise breached. It is hereby agreed that the Parties shall be entitled
to specific performance of the terms hereof and immediate injunctive relief
and other equitable relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy, and the Parties further hereby agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in connection with the
obtaining of such injunctive or other equitable relief. The Parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of injunctive relief, specific performance
or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. Each Party hereby acknowledges that the
existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish
the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any
other injunctive relief.

 



76

    

Section 10.12. _Negotiation of Agreement_. Each of Buyer and Seller
acknowledges that it has been represented by independent counsel of its
choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this
Agreement and that it has executed the same with consent and upon the advice
of said independent counsel. Each Party and its counsel cooperated in the
drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto shall be deemed the work
product of the Parties and may not be construed against either Party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against
the Party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.
The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a reasonable manner
to effect the intentions of the Parties and this Agreement.

 

Section 10.13. _Choice of Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard
to the conflict of laws principles of such State to the extent that the laws
of another jurisdiction would be required thereby.

 

Section 10.14. _Jurisdiction and Service of Process_ _; Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.14(b)_, with respect to any Action resulting
from, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement, and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its
successors or assigns, each Party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the
State of Delaware (the " _Designated Courts_ "). In any such action, suit or
proceeding, each Party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise (i) any claim
that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Designated Courts, (ii) that
its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, (iii) that
such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, (iv) that
the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper, (v) that such
action, suit or proceeding should be transferred or removed to any
court other than one of the Designated Courts, or should be stayed by reason
of the pendency of some other proceeding in any other court other than one of
the Designated Courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may
not be enforced in or by the Designated Courts. Each Party hereby agrees not
to commence any such action, suit or proceeding other than before one of the
Designated Courts. Each Party hereto also hereby agrees that any final and
unappealable judgment against a Party in connection with any such action,
suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such Party and that such
judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within
or outside of the U.S. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or
judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or
judgment. With respect to any action, suit or proceeding for which it has
submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_, each Party
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for the
giving of notices pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_. Nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 10.14_ shall affect the right of any party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law. The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall not
(i) constitute submission to jurisdiction or general consent to service of
process in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for any purpose except with
respect to any action, suit or proceeding resulting from, relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or (ii) be deemed to confer rights on any Person
other than the Parties to this Agreement.

 



77

    

(b) In the event that any dispute arises between the Parties with respect to
this Agreement, the Parties shall first use their commercially reasonable
efforts to settle such dispute. To this end, the Parties shall consult and
negotiate with each other in good faith to reach a solution satisfactory to
all Parties. As a necessary step in this dispute resolution process, in the
event the Parties are unable to resolve its dispute, each Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange a direct conversation between a
senior executive designated by such Party and a senior executive designated
by the other Party to attempt to resolve the dispute (an " _Executive Meeting_
"). If, for any reason, the Parties have not settled the dispute by
negotiation within thirty (30) days of receipt by a Party of written notice
of a dispute, or an Executive Meeting has not taken place within such thirty
(30) day period, then the Parties shall be free to pursue any other remedies
available to them pursuant to this Agreement to resolve such dispute; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that by agreeing to the foregoing dispute resolution
process, the Parties do not intend to deprive the Designated Courts of the
ability to issue an injunction to prevent irreparable harm, or other order in
aid of such process, and a Party shall not waive its right to participate in
such process under this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ if it seeks such relief. If
either Party fails to comply with the dispute resolution process set forth
above and a Party is required to resort to a separate Action to enforce such
compliance, then the non-complying Party shall reimburse all of the costs and
expenses incurred by the Party requesting such enforcement (including
reasonable attorneys fees).

Section 10.15. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES AND COVENANTS
THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF,
DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF
ANY ISSUE, ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, SUIT (IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH CASE
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (B) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (C) SUCH WAIVER
CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH SUCH PARTY IS RELYING AND WILL
RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT. EITHER PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 10.15_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY.

Section 10.16. _Conflicts; Privileges_. It is acknowledged by each of the
Parties that Seller and certain of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates have
retained Jones Day to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that Jones Day has not acted as counsel for any other
Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that no
other Party or Person has the status of a client of Jones Day for conflict of
interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Buyer hereby agrees that,
in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or any of its Affiliates and
Seller or any of its Affiliates, Jones Day may represent Seller or any such
Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of Seller or such
Affiliate may be directly

 



78

    

 adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) and even
though Jones Day may have represented the Rolling Mill Business or the Company
or any Rolling Mill Affiliate in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, and Buyer hereby waives, on behalf of themselves and each of its
Affiliates, any conflict of interest in connection with such representation by
Jones Day. Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications, whether
written or electronic, among Jones Day, Seller, the Company, or any Rolling
Mill Affiliate, and all files, attorney notes, drafts or other documents, that
relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that
predate the Closing, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client
confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to Seller
and may be controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer,
the Rolling Mill Business or the Company following the Closing. Buyer agrees
to take, and to cause its respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary
to implement the intent of this _Section_ __ _ 10.16_.

 

Section 10.17. _Counterparts; Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be deemed to
be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the
same instrument binding upon all the Parties notwithstanding the fact that all
Parties are not signatory to the original or the same counterpart. For
purposes of this Agreement, .PDF signatures shall be deemed originals.
