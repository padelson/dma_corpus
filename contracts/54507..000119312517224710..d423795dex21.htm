the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.02(j)_. All shares of Holdco Common Stock, together with the
amount of any such cash dividends and distributions deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.02(a)_, shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than four (4) Business
Days after the Effective Time), the Exchange Agent will mail to each holder
of record of a certificate representing outstanding shares of GPE Common Stock
and Westar Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Certificate_ ") and to each holder of uncertificated shares of GPE Common
Stock and Westar Common Stock represented by book entry immediately prior to
the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.01(b)_:

 



6 (1) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and that risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares held by such holder will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to GPE and Westar, and

(2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to
such shares.

(ii) Upon surrender to, and acceptance in accordance with _Section
2.02(b)(iii)_ by, the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the
holder thereof will be entitled to the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the number of shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered under this
Agreement. Until such time as the Merger Consideration is issued to or at the
direction of the holder of a surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares,
Holdco Common Stock that constitutes the Merger Consideration shall not be
voted on any matter.

(iii) The Exchange Agent will accept Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with customary exchange practices.

(iv) From and after the Effective Time, no further transfers may be made on
the records of GPE or Westar or its respective transfer agent of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and if any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented
to GPE or Westar for transfer, such Certificate of Book-Entry Share shall be
canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 

(v) If any Merger Consideration is to be remitted to a name other than that in
which a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, no Merger
Consideration may be paid in exchange for such surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share unless:

 

(1) either (A) the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer or (B) the
Book-Entry Share is properly transferred; and

(2) the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share or (B) establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



7 (vi) At any time after the Effective Time until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as
contemplated by _Section 2.01(b)_. No interest will be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar
Common Stock represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in GPE Common Stock and Westar Common
Stock_.

(i) At the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate, and each holder of
Book-Entry Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock, except, to the extent provided by
_Section 2.01_, for the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares upon surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_;

 

(ii) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender or exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this  _Section 2.02_
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than the right to receive
dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section
2.02(j)_).

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent will deliver to
Holdco, upon Holdcos demand, any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any
interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all
such funds) which remains undistributed to the former holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares upon expiration of the period ending one (1) year after
the Effective Time. Thereafter, any former holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares prior to the Mergers who has not complied with this _Section
2.02_ prior to such time, may look only to Holdco for payment of his, her or
its claim for Merger Consideration to which such holder may be entitled.

 

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund if and as directed by Holdco; _provided_ that such
investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of
a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000, or in
mutual funds investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Holdco.

 



8 (f) _No Liability_. None of Westar, GPE, Holdco, Merger Sub, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect
of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Holdco, GPE, Westar and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash and consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates,
Book-Entry Shares, Westar Restricted Share Units, Westar Performance Units,
Westar Other Equity-Based Rights, GPE Deferred Share Units, GPE Performance
Share Awards or GPE Other Equity-Based Rights such amounts for Taxes as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so deducted and withheld (or the
cash equivalent thereof) shall be promptly paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority, and shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Westar
Restricted Share Units, Westar Performance Units, Westar Other Equity-Based
Rights, GPE Deferred Share Units, GPE Performance Share Awards or GPE Other
Equity-Based Rights, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. Holdco or the Exchange Agent, as relevant, shall
provide advance notice of any requirement to withhold and deduct Taxes, and
shall obtain from holders of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Westar
Restricted Share Units, Westar Performance Units, Westar Other Equity-
Based Rights, GPE Deferred Share Units, GPE Performance Share Awards or GPE
Other Equity-Based Rights such certificates or other documents required to
avoid or reduce any such Taxes.

 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate formerly
representing shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Holdco, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Holdco may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver and pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

(i) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Holdco Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of GPE
Common Stock or Westar Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.01_, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights of a holder of Holdco Common Stock. For purposes of this _Section
2.02(i)_, all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be
entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three
decimal places. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of whole shares of
Holdco Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Holdco pursuant to
_Section 2.02(a)_ representing the Merger Consideration over (ii) the
aggregate number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock to be distributed to
former holders of GPE Common Stock and Westar Common Stock pursuant to 
_Section 2.02(b)_ (such excess being herein called the

 



9  " _Excess Shares_ "). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall, on behalf of former shareholders of GPE and Westar, sell the Excess
Shares at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE, all in the manner provided in
this _Section 2.02(i)_. The Parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration received from the sale of the Excess Shares in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock was not separately bargained for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Holdco that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock. The sale
of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE
through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round
lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use reasonable
efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the
Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agents sole judgment, is practicable
consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of
prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales
have been distributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
formerly representing GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for holders of GPE Common Stock and
Westar Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Holdco Surviving
Corporation shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the
Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares.
The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to
which each former holder of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock is
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds
composing the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the fractional share interest to which such former holder of GPE
Common Stock or Westar Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (after taking
into account all shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock, as
applicable, held at the Effective Time by such holder) and the denominator of
which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which
all former holders of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock would otherwise
be entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
formerly representing GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock with respect to
any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock, without interest,
subject to and in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.02(b)_.

(j) _Dividends with Respect to Holdco Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by
Holdco to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares there shall be paid to
the holder thereof, without interest and subject to any required Tax
withholding, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore

 



10  paid with respect to such shares of Holdco Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Holdco
Common Stock.

 

SECTION 2.03 _Equity Awards_.

Westar Performance Units to be the greater of the target award or the number

Westar Other Equity-Based Right shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time
and converted into a vested right to receive (i) the Westar Merger
Consideration _plus_ (ii) cash in an amount equal to any dividend equivalents
associated with such Westar Other Equity-Based Right as of the Effective Time,
subject to any withholding Taxes required by Law to be withheld in accordance
with _Section 2.02(g)_, such that as of the Effective Time, no Westar Other
Equity-Based Rights shall be outstanding. In each case, payment with respect
to any Westar Other Equity-Based Rights shall be made within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date; provided, however, that in the case of
any Westar Other Equity-Based Rights that constitute deferred compensation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, payment shall occur on
the date that it would otherwise occur under the applicable Westar Benefit
Plan or election form absent the application of this _Section 2.03(a)(iii)_
to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any penalty or other taxes
under Section 409A of the Code.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, GPE shall take such actions as are
necessary (including obtaining any resolutions of the GPE Board or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the GPE Stock Plan and
providing any required notices and obtaining any required consents) to effect
the following and to ensure that the conversions pursuant to _Section
2.01(b)_ of the GPE Common Stock held by any director or officer of GPE and

GPE Deferred Share Unit, including vesting.

 

(ii) _GPE Performance Share Awards_. At the Effective Time, each GPE
Performance Share Award that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be, as of the Effective Time, converted into an award
of a number of performance share awards of Holdco Common Stock equal to the
number of GPE Performance Share Awards of GPE Common Stock multiplied by the
GPE Exchange Ratio, under the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
such GPE Performance Share Awards, including vesting, and the performance
measurement period for such performance shares shall remain open (such that

17 SECTION 3.06 _Westar Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Westar has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated
therein) required to be furnished or filed by Westar with the SEC since
January 1, 2015 (such documents, together with all exhibits, financial
statements, including the Westar Financial Statements, and schedules
thereto and all information incorporated therein by reference, but excluding
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, being collectively referred to as the "
_Westar Reports_ "). Each Westar Report (i) at the time furnished or filed,
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Westar Report and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then
at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of Westar included in the Westar Reports
(the " _Westar Financial Statements_ ") complied at the time it was filed as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods and as of the dates involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presents in all material respects,
in accordance with GAAP, the consolidated financial position of Westar and
the Westars consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments).

(b) Neither Westar nor any Westar Subsidiary has any liability of any nature
that is required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of
Westar and the Westar Subsidiaries, except liabilities (i) reflected or
reserved against in the most recent balance sheet (including the
notes thereto) of Westar and the Westar Subsidiaries included in the Westar
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course
of business after March 31, 2017, (iii) incurred in connection with the
Mergers or any other transaction or agreement contemplated by this Agreement
or the Original Merger Agreement or (iv) that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Westar
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Westar maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act).
Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP in all material respects. Westar maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under

 



18  the Exchange Act that are effective in all material respects to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Westar in the reports it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation
of Westars filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. Westar
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to Westars outside auditors and the audit committee of the Westar
Board (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Westars ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (2) any fraud, known to Westar, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Westars
internal controls over financial reporting.

Agreement or the Original Merger Agreement.

 

(b) From December 31, 2016 to the date of this Agreement, there has not

Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes since the date of
the latest balance sheet included in the Westar Financial Statements except in
the ordinary course of business;

 

(e) neither Westar nor any Westar Subsidiary has any liability for material

the application of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous
provision of state, local or foreign Law, as a transferee or successor or by
contract;

 

(f) neither Westar nor any Westar Subsidiary is a party to or is otherwise

statute of limitations has not expired;

 

(i) there are no Liens on any of the assets of Westar or any or its
Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure)
to pay any material Tax (excluding Taxes that are being contested in good
faith for which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP);

 

(j) neither Westar nor any Westar Subsidiary has any Tax rulings, requests for
rulings, closing agreements or other similar agreements in effect or filed
with any Governmental Entity; and

(k) after reasonable diligence, neither Westar nor any Westar Subsidiary is
aware of the existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to take any action,
that would prevent the Westar Merger or GPE Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (or, in the
case of the Westar Merger, as an exchange described in Section 351 of the
Code).

 



20 (l) Except to the extent _Section 3.09_ relates to Taxes,
the representations and warranties contained in this _Section 3.08_ are the
sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Westar relating to Taxes,
and no other representation or warranty of Westar contained herein shall be
construed to relate to Taxes.

SECTION 3.09 _Employee Benefits_.

complete and accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each
material Westar Benefit Plan and each material Westar Benefit Agreement.

(b) With respect to each material Westar Benefit Plan and material Westar

payments and other payments required to be made by Westar or any Westar
Commonly Controlled Entity to any Westar Benefit Plan have been made on or

Material Adverse Effect, neither Westar nor any Westar Commonly Controlled
Entity has engaged in, and to the Knowledge of Westar, there has not been, any
non-exempt transaction prohibited by ERISA or by Section 4975 of the Code with
respect to any Westar Benefit Plan or Westar Benefit Agreement or their

Controlled Entity has contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
such plan within the six years preceding this Agreement. Except for matters
that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Westar Material Adverse Effect, neither Westar nor any

IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412, 430
and 4971 of the Code or (iv) as a result of the failure to comply with the

401(a) of the Code is so qualified and such plan has received a currently
effective favorable determination letter or, if applicable, current opinion or

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Westar
Material Adverse Effect, neither Westar nor any Westar Subsidiary has any
liability for providing health, medical or other welfare benefits after

by either party of its covenants and agreements hereunder or the consummation
of the Mergers (alone or in conjunction with any other event, including any
termination of employment before, on or following the Effective Time) will (i)
entitle any Westar Personnel to any material compensation or benefit, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding,
of any material compensation or benefit or trigger any other material
obligation under any Westar Benefit Plan or Westar Benefit Agreement or (iii)
will result in any payment that could, individually or in combination with
any other such payment, not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Westar relating to
Westar Benefit Plans or Westar Benefit Agreements (including their compliance
with any applicable Law) or ERISA, and no other representation or warranty of
Westar contained herein shall be construed to relate to Westar Benefit Plans
or Westar Benefit Agreements (including their compliance with any applicable

other documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated
therein) required to be furnished or filed by GPE or GPE Utility Sub with the
SEC since January 1, 2015 (such documents, together with all exhibits,
financial statements, including the GPE Financial Statements, and schedules
thereto and all information incorporated therein by reference, but excluding
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, being collectively referred to as the " _GPE
Reports_ "). Each GPE Report (i) at the time furnished or filed, complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder), as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such GPE
Report and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded
by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time
of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial
statements of GPE included in the GPE Reports (the " _GPE Financial
Statements_ ") complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with

permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods and as of the dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly presents in all

 



32  material respects, in accordance with GAAP, the consolidated financial
position of GPE and GPEs consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods shown (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

 

(b) None of GPE, any GPE Subsidiary, Holdco and Merger Sub has any liability
of any nature that is required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated
balance sheet of GPE, the GPE Subsidiaries, Holdco and Merger Sub, except

Sub included in the GPE Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (ii) incurred
in the ordinary course of business after March 31, 2017, (iii) incurred in

Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP in all material respects. GPE maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by GPE in
the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of GPEs filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents. GPE has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date of this Agreement, to GPEs outside auditors and the audit
committee of the GPE Board (1) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect GPEs ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, known to GPE,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in GPEs internal controls over financial reporting.

to any GPE Benefit Plan or GPE Benefit Agreement and (iii) all contributions,
reimbursements, premium payments and other payments required to be made by GPE
or any GPE Commonly Controlled Entity to any GPE Benefit Plan have been made
on or before their applicable due dates. Except as, individually or in the

Material Adverse Effect, neither GPE nor any GPE Commonly Controlled Entity
has engaged in, and to the Knowledge of GPE, there has not been, any non-

of ERISA, and neither GPE nor any GPE Commonly Controlled Entity has
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any such plan within the six
years preceding this Agreement. Except for

 



34  matters that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a GPE Material Adverse Effect, neither GPE
nor any GPE Commonly Controlled Entity has incurred any Controlled Group

401(a) of the Code is so qualified and such plan has received a currently
effective favorable determination letter or, if applicable, current opinion or
advisory letter to that effect from the IRS and, to the Knowledge of GPE,
there is no reason why any such determination letter should be revoked.

result in any payment that could, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

51 SECTION 5.04 _No Solicitation by Westar; Westar Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Westar shall not, and shall not authorize any of its Affiliates or any of
its and their respective officers, directors, principals, partners, managers,
members, attorneys, accountants, agents, employees, consultants, financial
advisors or other authorized representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Westar Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Westar
Takeover Proposal, in each case, except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) directly or indirectly participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (except for Westars
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives or GPE and GPEs
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives) regarding, or
furnish to any such Person, any nonpublic information with respect to, or
cooperate in any way with any such Person with respect to, any Westar Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Westar Takeover Proposal. Westar shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
(except for Westars Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives
or GPE and GPEs Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Westar Takeover Proposal,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
data room access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Westar Shareholder Approval, in response to the receipt of a
bona fide written Westar Takeover Proposal made after the date of this
Agreement that does not result from a breach (other than an immaterial
breach) of this _Section 5.04(a)_ by Westar and that the Westar Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Westar Proposal, Westar and its Representatives may (1) furnish
information with respect to Westar and the Westar Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Westar Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) ( _provided_
that all such information has previously been provided to GPE or is provided
to GPE prior to or concurrently with the provision of such information to such
Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement and (2) participate
in discussions regarding the terms of such Westar Takeover Proposal,
including terms of a Westar Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto, and
the negotiation of such terms with the Person making such Westar Takeover
Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing,
it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
5.04(a)_ by any Representative of Westar or any of its Affiliates, in each
case, at Westars direction, shall constitute a breach of this _Section
5.04(a)_ by Westar. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Westar
may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow a confidential Westar
Takeover Proposal to be made to Westar or the Westar Board so long as the
Westar Board promptly (and in any event, within one Business Day) notifies GPE
thereof after granting any such waiver, amendment or release.

 



52 (b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.04(a)_,  _Section 5.04(c)_ and
_Section 5.04(e)_, and except for the public disclosure of a Westar
Recommendation Change Notice, neither the Westar Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in any manner
adverse to GPE, or propose publicly to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or
modify in any manner adverse to GPE, the Westar Board Recommendation, (ii)
adopt, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve
or recommend, any Westar Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to include in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus the Westar Board Recommendation or (iv) take any
formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection
with a tender offer or exchange offer (except for a recommendation against
such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (any action in the
foregoing clauses (i)(iv) being referred to as a " _Westar Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Except as set forth in _Section 5.04(a)_, _Section
5.04(c)_ and _Section 5.04(e)_, neither the Westar Board nor any committee
thereof shall authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or allow Westar or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, agreement or commitment constituting,
or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Westar Takeover Proposal,
or requiring, or that would reasonably be expected to cause, Westar to abandon
or terminate this Agreement (a " _Westar Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Westar Shareholder Approval, the Westar Board may make a Westar
Adverse Recommendation Change (and, solely with respect to a Superior Westar
Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(i)_) if (i)
a Westar Intervening Event has occurred or (ii) Westar has received a Superior
Westar Proposal that does not result from a breach (other than an immaterial
breach) of _Section 5.04_ by Westar and, in each case, if the Westar Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor) that the failure to effect a Westar Adverse Recommendation
Change as a result of the occurrence of such Westar Intervening Event or in
response to the receipt of such Superior Westar Proposal, as the case may be,
would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Westar Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Westar Board
may not make such Westar Adverse Recommendation Change unless (1) the Westar
Board has provided prior written notice to GPE (a " _Westar Recommendation
Change Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect a Westar Adverse
Recommendation Change at least three (3) Business Days prior to taking such
action, which notice shall specify the basis for such Westar Adverse
Recommendation Change and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, attaching the
most current draft of any Westar Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Westar Proposal or, if no draft exists, a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Westar Proposal (it being understood
that such Westar Recommendation Change Notice shall not in itself be deemed a
Westar Adverse Recommendation Change and that if GPE has committed in writing
to any changes to the terms of this Agreement

 



53  and there has been any subsequent material revision or amendment to the
terms of a Superior Westar Proposal, a new notice to which the provisions of
clauses (2), (3) and (4) of this  _Section 5.04(c)_ shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ except that, in the case of such a new notice, all references to
three (3) Business Days in this _Section 5.04(c)_ shall be deemed to be two
(2) Business Days), (2) during the three (3) Business Day period after
delivery of the Westar Recommendation Change Notice, Westar and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith with GPE and its Representatives
regarding any revisions to this Agreement that GPE proposes to make and (3)
at the end of such three (3) Business Day period and taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by GPE, the
Westar Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor) that the failure to make such a Westar
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and that, in the case of a Westar Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to a Westar Takeover Proposal, such Westar
Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior Westar Proposal.

 

(d) Westar shall promptly (and in any event no later than the later of (i)
twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) 5 p.m. New York City time on the next Business
Day) advise GPE orally and in writing of any Westar Takeover Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Westar Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the Person making any such Westar Takeover Proposal. Westar shall
keep GPE reasonably informed in all material respects on a reasonably current
basis (and in any event no later than the later of (i) twenty-four (24) hours
or (ii) 5 p.m. New York City time on the next Business Day) of the material
terms and status (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Westar
Takeover Proposal.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.04_ shall prohibit Westar from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of Westar if, in the good-
faith judgment of the Westar Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable Law.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Westar Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not
in writing), with respect to any (1) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Westar, (2) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint
venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Westar
Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of Westar or the Westar
Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income
or assets of Westar and the Westar Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (3)
issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or
the shareholders of any Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such
securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power 

 



54  of Westar, (4) transaction (including any tender offer or exchange offer) in
which any Person (or the shareholders of any Person) would acquire (in the
case of a tender offer or exchange offer, if consummated), directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right
to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of any class of capital stock
of Westar or (5) any combination of the foregoing.

(ii) " _Superior Westar Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Westar
Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this definition, the
applicable percentage in the definition of Westar Takeover Proposal shall be
"50.1%" rather than "20% or more"), which the Westar Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor,
and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other
aspects of such Westar Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person making
the proposal and any financing required for such proposal, the ability of the
Person making such proposal to obtain such required financing and the level of
certainty with respect to such required financing, and such other factors
that are deemed relevant by the Westar Board, is more favorable to the holders
of Westar Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after taking into account any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that
are committed to in writing by GPE (including pursuant to _Section
5.04(c)_).

(iii) " _Westar Intervening Event_ " means any fact, circumstance, effect,
change, event or development relating to Westar or the Westar Subsidiaries
that (1) is unknown to or by the Westar Board as of the date hereof (or if
known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or
understood by the Westar Board as of the date of this Agreement), (2) becomes
known to or by the Westar Board prior to obtaining the Westar Shareholder
Approval and (3) has or would reasonably be expected to have a material
beneficial effect on Westar and the Westar Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

SECTION 5.05 _No Solicitation by GPE; GPE Board Recommendation_.

(a) GPE shall not, and shall not authorize any of its Affiliates or any of
its and their respective Representatives to, (i) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any GPE
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected
to lead to a GPE Takeover Proposal, or (ii) directly or indirectly
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (except for
GPEs Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives or Westar and
Westars Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives) regarding,
or furnish to any such Person, any nonpublic information with respect to, or
cooperate in any way with any such Person with respect to, any GPE Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead
to a GPE Takeover Proposal. GPE shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (except
for GPEs Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives or Westar

55  Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any GPE Takeover Proposal, request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished
and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access
previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to obtaining the
GPE Shareholder Approval, in response to the receipt of a bona fide written
GPE Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that does not
result from a breach (other than an immaterial breach) of this _Section
5.05(a)_ by GPE and that the GPE Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor) constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior GPE Proposal, GPE and
its Representatives may (1) furnish information with respect to GPE and GPE
Subsidiaries to the Person making such GPE Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to Westar or is provided to Westar prior to or concurrently with the
provision of such information to such Person) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement and (2) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such GPE Takeover Proposal, including terms of a GPE
Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto, and the negotiation of such terms
with the Person making such GPE Takeover Proposal (and such Persons
Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.05(a)_ by any
Representative of GPE or any of its Affiliates, in each case, at GPEs
direction, shall constitute a breach of this _Section 5.05(a)_ by GPE.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, GPE may grant a waiver,
amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement to the
extent necessary to allow a confidential GPE Takeover Proposal to be made to
GPE or the GPE Board so long as the GPE Board promptly (and in any event,
within one Business Day) notifies Westar thereof after granting any such
waiver, amendment or release.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.05(a)_, _Section 5.05(c)_ and
_Section 5.05(e)_, and except for the public disclosure of a GPE
Recommendation Change Notice, neither the GPE Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in any manner adverse
to Westar, or propose publicly to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or
modify in any manner adverse to Westar, the GPE Board Recommendation, (ii)
adopt, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or
recommend, any GPE Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to include in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus the GPE Board Recommendation or (iv) take any formal
action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer (except for a recommendation against such offer
or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (any action in the foregoing clauses
(i)(iv) being referred to as a " _GPE Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Except as set forth in _Section 5.05(a)_, _Section 5.05(c)_ and _Section
5.05(e)_, neither the GPE Board nor any committee thereof shall authorize,
permit, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to authorize, permit,
approve or recommend, or allow GPE or any of its Affiliates to execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, agreement or commitment constituting, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any GPE Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or that would
reasonably be expected to cause, GPE to abandon or terminate this Agreement
(a " _GPE Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



56 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior
to obtaining the GPE Shareholder Approval, the GPE Board may make a GPE
Adverse Recommendation Change (and solely with respect to a Superior GPE
Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(iii)_) if (i)
a GPE Intervening Event has occurred or (ii) GPE has received a Superior GPE
Proposal that does not result from a breach (other than an immaterial breach)
of _Section 5.05_ by GPE and, in each case, if the GPE Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor) that the failure to effect a GPE Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of the occurrence of such GPE Intervening Event or in response to the
receipt of such Superior GPE Proposal, as the case may be, would reasonably
likely be inconsistent with the GPE Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the GPE Board may not make such GPE Adverse
Recommendation Change unless (1) the GPE Board has provided prior written
notice to Westar (a " _GPE Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is
prepared to effect a GPE Adverse Recommendation Change at least three (3)
Business Days prior to taking such action, which notice shall specify the
basis for such GPE Adverse Recommendation Change and, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, attaching the most current draft of any GPE Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior GPE Proposal or, if no draft exists,
a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior GPE Proposal
(it being understood that such GPE Recommendation Change Notice shall not in
itself be deemed a GPE Adverse Recommendation Change and that if Westar
has committed in writing to any changes to the terms of this Agreement and
there has been any subsequent material revision or amendment to the terms of a
Superior GPE Proposal, a new notice to which the provisions of clauses (2),
(3) and (4) of this _Section 5.05(c)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ except
that, in the case of such a new notice, all references to three (3) Business
Days in this _Section 5.05(c)_ shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days),
(2) during the three (3) Business Day period after delivery of the GPE
Recommendation Change Notice, GPE and its Representatives negotiate in good
faith with Westar and its Representatives regarding any revisions to this
Agreement that Westar proposes to make and (3) at the end of such three (3)
Business Day period and taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement committed to in writing by Westar, the GPE Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor) that the failure to make such a GPE Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
that, in the case of a GPE Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a
GPE Takeover Proposal, such GPE Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior
GPE Proposal.

 

(d) GPE shall promptly (and in any event no later than the later of (i)
twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) 5 p.m. New York City time on the next Business
Day) advise Westar orally and in writing of any GPE Takeover Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such GPE Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the Person making any such GPE Takeover Proposal. GPE shall keep
Westar reasonably informed in all material respects on a reasonably current
basis (and in any event no later than the later of (i) twenty-four (24) hours
or (ii) 5 p.m. New York City time on the next Business Day) of the material
terms and status (including any change to the terms thereof) of any GPE
Takeover Proposal.

 



57 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.05_ shall prohibit GPE from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of GPE if, in the good-faith
judgment of the GPE Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable Law.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _GPE Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to any (1) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving GPE, (2) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint
venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a GPE
Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of GPE or the GPE
Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income
or assets of GPE and the GPE Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (3) issuance,
sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or
the shareholders of any Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such
securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of GPE, (4)
transaction (including any tender offer or exchange offer) in which any
Person (or the shareholders of any Person) would acquire (in the case of a
tender offer or exchange offer, if consummated), directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or
formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of any class of capital stock of GPE or
(5) any combination of the foregoing.

 

(ii) " _Superior GPE Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written GPE Takeover
Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this definition, the applicable
percentage in the definition of GPE Takeover Proposal shall be "50.1%" rather
than "20% or more"), which the GPE Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, and taking
into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of
such GPE Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person making the proposal and
any financing required for such proposal, the ability of the Person making
such proposal to obtain such required financing and the level of certainty
with respect to such required financing, and such other factors that are
deemed relevant by the GPE Board, is more favorable to the holders of GPE
Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
taking into account any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that are
committed to in writing by Westar (including pursuant to _Section 5.05(c)_).

 

(iii) " _GPE Intervening Event_ " means any fact, circumstance, effect,
change, event or development relating to GPE or the GPE Subsidiaries that (1)
is unknown to or by the GPE Board as of the date hereof (or if known, the
magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or understood by

 



58  the GPE Board as of the date of this Agreement), (2) becomes known to or by
the GPE Board prior to obtaining the GPE Shareholder Approval and (3) has or
would reasonably be expected to have a material beneficial effect on GPE and
the GPE Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

SECTION 5.06 _Dividends_. Each of GPE and Westar shall coordinate with the
other regarding the declaration and payment of dividends in respect of GPE
Common Stock and Westar Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates
relating thereto, it being the intention of GPE and Westar that no holder of
GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock shall receive two dividends, or fail
to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter (or portion thereof)
with respect to its shares of GPE Common Stock or Westar Common Stock, as
the case may be, and/or any shares of Holdco Common Stock any such holder
receives pursuant to the Mergers. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the
Parties intent that (a) the first quarterly dividend paid to the holders of
Holdco Common Stock (including former holders of Westar Common Stock)
following the Effective Time shall be paid in accordance with GPEs dividend
policy, to be adopted by Holdco immediately after the Effective Time, and in
no event later than the first record date for the payment of dividends after
the Closing Date, and (b) the Parties accordingly shall coordinate their
declaration and payment of dividends prior to the Effective Time and GPE shall
coordinate the declaration and payment of its dividends after the Effective
Time.

SECTION 5.07 _Tax Status_. None of Holdco, GPE or Westar shall, or shall
permit any of its respective Subsidiaries to, take any actions that would be
reasonably likely to adversely affect the status of (i) the GPE Merger as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) the Westar Merger as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and (iii) the Mergers, taken
together, as a contribution under Section 351 of the Code.

receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to, or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall

jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state
securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in

Statement/Prospectus, GPE shall promptly notify Westar of such event, and
Holdco, GPE and Westar shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of
any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so
that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and, as required by
Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or

the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the shareholders of GPE, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the GPE Shareholders Meeting and,

GPE, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
required consent of such third party to disclose such document or information)

62  to any attorneyclient privilege ( _provided_ that Westar and GPE, as
applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the disclosure of
such document or information (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that
does not result in a loss of attorneyclient privilege) or is commercially
sensitive (as determined in Westars and GPEs, as applicable, reasonable
discretion); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that neither Westar nor GPE or their
respective Representatives shall have the right to collect any air, soil,
surface water or ground water samples or perform any invasive or destructive

Agreement.

 



63 (b) In connection with and without limiting the generality of  _Section

meeting or conversation and, in

 



64  the event one Party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting or

this Agreement or the Mergers; _provided_ that the Parties shall be permitted
to redact any correspondence, Filing or communication to the extent such
correspondence, Filing or communication contains commercially sensitive
information.

 

(c) Neither GPE nor Westar shall, and each shall cause its Affiliates not to,
take any action, including acquiring any asset, property, business or Person
(by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, investment, other business
combination, asset, stock or equity purchase, or otherwise), that could
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining or
making any Consent or Filing contemplated by this _Section 6.03_ or the
timely receipt thereof. In furtherance of and without limiting any of GPEs or
Westars covenants and agreements under this _Section 6.03_, each of GPE and
Westar shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment that may be asserted by a Governmental Entity pursuant to any

any Required Statutory Approval so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible, which such reasonable best efforts shall include the

without the prior written consent of the other Party, to undertake any efforts

separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition

notify the other Party of any shareholder litigation arising from this

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

SECTION 6.05 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Westar and GPE shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Westar Common Stock and GPE Common Stock (including derivative

between or among the Parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (d) a press release or other public statement that is
consistent in all material respects with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by a Party in accordance with this
Agreement, including in investor conference calls, SEC Filings, QandAs or other
publicly disclosed documents, in each case under this clause (d), to the
extent such disclosure is still accurate, GPE and Westar shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other written public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Mergers, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such written public statement prior to such consultation, except as such
Party reasonably concludes (based upon advice of its outside legal counsel)
may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system. Westar and GPE agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to this Agreement or Mergers shall be in a
form agreed to by the Parties. Nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall limit the
ability of any Party to make internal announcements to its respective
employees that are consistent in all material respects with the prior public
disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.08 _Fees, Costs and Expenses_. Except as provided otherwise in this
Agreement, including _Section 8.02(b)_, all fees, costs and expenses

hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees, costs or expenses,
whether or not the Closing occurs.

 



68 SECTION 6.09 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Holdco agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of Westar, the Westar Subsidiaries, GPE and
the GPE Subsidiaries as provided in their respective Organization Documents
and any indemnification or other similar Contracts of Westar, any Westar
Subsidiary, GPE or any GPE Subsidiary, in each case, as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms (it being agreed that after the Closing such rights shall be
mandatory rather than permissive, if applicable), and Holdco shall cause the
Westar Surviving Corporation and the Westar Subsidiaries to perform their
respective obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and
after the Effective Time, Holdco agrees that it will indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of
Westar, any Westar Subsidiary, GPE or any GPE Subsidiary or who is as of the
date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective
Time, serving at the request of Westar, any Westar Subsidiary, GPE or any GPE
Subsidiary as a director, officer or employee of another Person (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
Claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was a director, officer or employee of Westar, any Westar Subsidiary,
GPE, any GPE Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of Westar, any
Westar Subsidiary, GPE or any GPE Subsidiary as a director, officer or
employee of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In
the event of any Claim covered under this _Section 6.09_, (i) each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such Claim from Holdco; _provided_ that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by applicable Law or Holdcos Organizational Documents, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person
is not entitled to indemnification and (ii) Holdco shall cooperate in good
faith in the defense of any such matter.

(b) In the event that Holdco or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, Holdco shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco assume the covenants
and agreements set forth in this  _Section 6.09_.

 



69 (c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
Holdco shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Westar, the Westar Subsidiaries, GPE or the GPE Subsidiaries or
provide substitute policies for Westar, GPE and their respective current and
former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
Westar and GPE, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and
having other terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons than
the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by Westar and GPE with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time (with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance), except that in no event shall Holdco be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more
than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by Westar or GPE
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if Holdco
is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 6.09(c)_ it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six
(6) year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect
of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to
the Closing Date Westar may, at its option, purchase a "tail" directors and
officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy
for Westar, GPE and their respective current and former directors, officers
and employees who are currently covered by the directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Westar and GPE,
such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage
and to have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons
than the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by Westar and GPE with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time for a period of not less than six (6) years; _provided_ that in no event
shall the cost of any such tail policy in respect of any one policy year
exceed the Maximum Amount. Holdco shall maintain such policies in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (iii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 

SECTION 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the two
(2) year anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Holdco shall, and shall cause the Westar Surviving Corporation to, provide
each individual who is employed by Westar or a Westar Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed thereafter by the Westar
Surviving Corporation, Holdco or any of

 



70  their Subsidiaries (each, a " _Westar Employee_ ") who is not a Westar
Represented Employee (as defined in _Section 6.10(b)_) with (i) a base salary
or wage rate that is no less favorable than that provided to the Westar
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) aggregate incentive
compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to those provided to the Westar Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable,
in the aggregate, to those provided to the Westar Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time. During the Continuation Period, Holdco shall, and
shall cause the Westar Surviving Corporation to, provide each Westar Employee
who experiences a termination of employment with the Westar Surviving
Corporation, Holdco or any of their Subsidiaries severance benefits that are
no less favorable than those set forth in _Section 6.10(a)(1)_ of the AandR
Westar Disclosure Letter. During the two (2) year period following the Closing
Date, subject to _Section 6.10(e)(ii)_, Holdco shall, or shall cause the
Westar Surviving Corporation to, treat retirees of Westar and its Subsidiaries
with respect to the provision of post-retirement welfare benefits no less
favorably than similarly situated retirees of Holdco and its Subsidiaries.
Except as provided on _Section 6.10(a)(2)_ of the AandR Westar Disclosure
Letter, as soon as practicable following the end of the fiscal year in which
the Effective Time occurs, Holdco shall, or shall cause the Westar Surviving
Corporation to, pay each Westar Employee who remains employed with the Westar
Surviving Corporation, Holdco or any of their Subsidiaries through the
applicable payment date an annual cash bonus for such fiscal year in an amount
determined based on the level of attainment of the applicable performance
criteria under the bonus plan in which such Westar Employee participated as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) With respect to each Westar Employee who is covered by a Westar Union
Contract (each, a " _Westar Represented Employee_ "), Holdco shall, and shall
cause the Westar Surviving Corporation to, continue to honor the Westar Union
Contracts, in each case as in effect at the Effective Time, in accordance with
their terms (it being understood that this sentence shall not be construed to
limit the ability of Holdco or the Westar Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate any such Westar Union Contract, to the extent permitted by the terms
of the applicable Westar Union Contract and applicable Law). The provisions
of this _Section 6.10_ shall be subject to any applicable provisions of the
Westar Union Contracts and applicable Law in respect of such Westar
Represented Employee, to the extent the provisions of this  _Section 6.10_
are inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the provisions of any such
Westar Union Contract or applicable Law. Prior to the Closing Date, Westar
shall provide, to the extent required by applicable Law, sufficient advance
notice of the transactions contemplated hereby to any unions that are party to
a Westar Union Contract, and, in response to a request from any such union to
engage in bargaining over the effect of the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall engage in meaningful, good-faith bargaining, to the extent required by
applicable Law.

(c) At the Effective Time, Holdco shall, or shall cause the Westar Surviving
Corporation to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of
Westars and all of the Westar Subsidiaries employment, severance, retention,
termination and change-in-control plans, policies, programs, agreements and
arrangements (including any change-in-control severance agreement or other
arrangement between Westar and any Westar Employee) maintained by Westar or
any Westar Subsidiary, in each case, as in effect at 

 



71  the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or
rights arising as a result of the Mergers (either alone or in combination with
any other event), it being understood that this sentence shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Holdco or the Westar Surviving Corporation
to amend or terminate any such plans, policies, programs, agreements, or
arrangements, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable plan,
policy, program, agreement or arrangement and applicable Law. For purposes of
any Westar Benefit Plan or Westar Benefit Agreement containing a definition of
"change in control," "change of control" or similar term that relates to a
transaction at the level of Westar, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute
a "change in control," "change of control" or such similar term.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, Holdco shall, or shall cause a GPE Subsidiary to,
assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of GPEs and all of the
GPE Subsidiaries employment, severance, retention, termination and change-in-
control plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any
change-in-control severance agreement or other arrangement between GPE and
any individual who is employed by GPE or a GPE Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Effective Time and who remains employed thereafter by Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries) maintained by GPE or any GPE Subsidiary, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Mergers (either alone or in combination
with any other event), it being understood that this sentence shall not
be construed to limit the ability of Holdco or any GPE Subsidiary to amend or
terminate any such plans, policies, programs, agreements, or arrangements, to
the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement and applicable Law. For purposes of any GPE Benefit
Plan or GPE Benefit Agreement containing a definition of "change in control,"
"change of control" or similar term that relates to a transaction at the level
of GPE, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control,"
"change of control" or such similar term.

 

(e) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Holdco, the Westar Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid
time-off and severance plans), each Westar Employees service with Westar or
any Westar Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor employer of
Westar or any such Westar Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer was recognized by Westar or such Westar Subsidiary and is
accurately reflected within a Westar Employees records) shall be treated as
service with Holdco, the Westar Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, except (i) to
the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Westar Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) for purposes
of any defined benefit retirement plan, any retiree welfare benefit plan, any
grandfathered or frozen plan or any plan under which similarly situated
employees of Holdco and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior
service or (iii) to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. 

 



72 (f) Holdco shall, and shall cause the Westar Surviving Corporation to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Holdco, the
Westar Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in which Westar
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the corresponding Westar
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Holdco shall, or shall
cause the Westar Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Westar Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no provision of this _Section 6.10_ is intended to, or shall, constitute
the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan
for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no Westar Personnel or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof including in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment). Nothing contained herein shall alter the at-will
employment relationship of any Westar Employee.

SECTION 6.11  _Holdco; Merger Sub_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, neither Holdco nor Merger Sub shall engage in
any activity of any nature except for activities related to or in furtherance
of the Mergers.

(b) GPE hereby (i) guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment
performance and discharge by Holdco and Merger Sub of, and compliance by
Holdco and Merger Sub with, all of the covenants and agreements of Holdco and
Merger Sub under this Agreement and (ii) agrees to take all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and
discharge by Holdco and Merger Sub hereunder.

 

SECTION 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute or similar statute
or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Mergers, Westar and
the Westar Board and GPE and the GPE Board shall use reasonable best efforts
to grant such approvals and take such actions to ensure that the Mergers may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement.

SECTION 6.13 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Holdco shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued in the
Mergers to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing. Each of Westar and GPE shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Holdco in connection with the
foregoing, including by providing information reasonably requested by Holdco
in connection therewith.

 



73 SECTION 6.14 _Redemption of GPE Preference Stock_. Prior to the Closing, GPE
shall redeem all of the issued and outstanding shares of GPE Preference Stock
pursuant to Section 13 of the Certificate of Designations for the GPE
Preference Stock.

 

SECTION 6.15 _Further Assurances_. It may be preferable to effectuate a
business combination between GPE and Westar by means of an alternative
structure in light of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01(b)_, _Section
7.02(e)_ and _Section 7.03(e)_. Accordingly, if the only conditions to the
parties obligations to consummate the Mergers that are not satisfied or
waived are receipt of any one or more of the Westar Required Consents, GPE
Required Consents, and the Required Statutory Approvals, and the adoption of
an alternative structure (that otherwise substantially preserves for GPE and
Westar the economic benefits of the Mergers without adversely affecting either
GPE or Westar in any material respect) would result in such conditions being
satisfied or waived, then the Parties shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to effect a business combination among
themselves by means of a mutually agreed upon structure other than the Mergers
that so preserves such benefits without adversely affecting either GPE or
Westar in any material respect;  _provided_ that prior to closing any such
restructured transaction, all third party and Governmental Authority
declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or
approvals necessary for the effectuation of such alternative business
combination shall have been obtained and all other conditions to the Parties
obligations to consummate the Mergers, as applied to such alternative business
combination, shall have been satisfied or waived.

shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to Westar, the holders of the Westar Common
Stock, Holdco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or

costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, suffered or
incurred by Westar, the Westar Subsidiaries or any other Person in connection

or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity); _provided_ that,

the GPE Fiduciary Out Termination Fee or the GPE No Vote Termination Fee,

83  waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity); _provided_  that, regardless of whether Westar
pays or is obligated to pay the Westar Termination Fee, nothing in this
_Section 8.02(d)_ shall release Westar from liability for a Willful Breach of
this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) in no event shall
Westar or GPE, as applicable, be required to pay the Westar Termination Fee,
the GPE Termination Fee, the GPE Fiduciary Out Termination Fee or the GPE No
Vote Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion, (ii) the GPE
Fiduciary Out Termination Fee may become due and payable pursuant to _Section

pay an amount equal to the GPE Fiduciary Out Termination Fee less the amount
of the GPE No Vote Fee previously paid and (iii) if a termination event occurs
requiring GPE to pay a termination fee hereunder and at such time more
than one right to terminate this Agreement is exercisable by the Parties, GPE
shall be obligated to pay the largest termination fee that would be applicable
without regard to which termination right was actually exercised (e.g., if
termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iv)_ and _Section 8.01(c)(iv)_ is
permitted, GPE shall be obligated to pay the GPE Fiduciary Out Termination Fee
even if GPE terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iv)_).

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " means a breach that
is a consequence of a deliberate act or deliberate failure to act undertaken
by the breaching Party with the Knowledge that the taking of, or failure to
take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute
a material breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ that, without limiting the meaning of Willful Breach, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that any failure by any Party to consummate the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby after the applicable
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the
time of such failure to consummate the Mergers) shall constitute a Willful
Breach of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Westar Shareholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Westar Shareholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of Westar without the further approval of such shareholders, (b)
no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time and (c)

limitation."

SECTION 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement

under this _Section 9.05_ with respect thereto. Upon any determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 9.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or email in .pdf format), all

herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein.

 



88 SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of
action of the Parties (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or
whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may
be based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, performance or subject matter hereof, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas, without regard
to principles of conflict of laws, except to the extent any mandatory
provisions of the General Business and Corporation Law of the State of
Missouri govern.

SECTION 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without

Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 9.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any
time prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ ,
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of
terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to
cause each other Party to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in any court referred to in _Section 9.11_,
without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. If any Party brings any Claim to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the End Date
shall automatically be extended by the period of time between the
commencement of such Claim and the date on which such Claim is fully and
finally resolved.

 

SECTION 9.11 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. All Claims arising from, under or in
connection with this Agreement shall be raised to and exclusively determined

court disclaims jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the District of
Kansas, to whose jurisdiction and venue the Parties unconditionally
consent and submit. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any objection to the laying of venue of Claim arising out of this Agreement in
such court and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agree
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Claim brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agree
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered
mail to the respective addresses set forth in _Section 9.02_ hereof shall be
effective service of process for any Claim brought against such Party in any
such court.

 



89 SECTION 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGERS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

SECTION 9.13  _Construction_. Each of the Parties has participated in the
drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.14 _Withdrawal of Original Merger Sub_. By executing this Agreement,
Original Merger Sub hereby withdraws from the Original Merger Agreement as a
party thereto, and from and after the date hereof, Original Merger Sub shall
have no further rights to or interests in, or liabilities or obligations
relating to or arising out of, the Original Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby. The Parties acknowledge that Original
Merger Sub is executing this Agreement solely for the purpose of withdrawing
from the Original Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
as described above.

Company entitled to vote.

ARTICLE TWELVE

 

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
he or she is or was a Director or officer of the Company or is or was serving
at the request of the Company as a Director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent authorized
by the Missouri General and Business Corporation Law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts
paid to or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in
paragraph (b) hereof, the Company shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Company. The right to indemnification conferred in
this ARTICLE TWELVE shall be a contract right and shall include the right to
be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition: provided, however, that, if the Missouri
General and Business Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses
incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or
officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by
such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a
proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking,
by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced
if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified under this ARTICLE TWELVE or otherwise. The Company
may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees
and agents of the Company with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers. Such indemnification shall continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.

 



D-7 (b) _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under paragraph (a) of this
ARTICLE TWELVE is not paid in full by the Company within thirty days after a
written claim has been received by the Company, the claimant may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a
defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim
for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been
tendered to the Company) that the claimant has not met the standards of
conduct which make it permissible under the Missouri General and Business
Corporation Law for the Company to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Company.
Neither the failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the Missouri General and Business
Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its
Board of Directors, independent, legal counsel, or its shareholders) that the
claimant has not met such applicable standard or conduct, shall be a defense
to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.

 

(c) _Rights Not Exclusive_. The indemnification and other rights provided by
this ARTICLE TWELVE shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which a person may be entitled under any applicable law, By-laws of the
Company, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors or
otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to
action in any other capacity while holding the office of Director or officer,
and the Company is hereby expressly authorized by the shareholders of the
Company to enter into agreements with its Directors and officers which provide
greater indemnification rights than that generally provided by the Missouri
General and Business Corporation Law; _provided_ , however, that no such
further indemnity shall indemnify any person from or on account of such
Directors or officers conduct which was finally adjudged to have been
knowingly fraudulent, deliberately dishonest or willful misconduct. Any such
agreement providing for further indemnity entered into pursuant to this
ARTICLE TWELVE after the date of approval of this ARTICLE TWELVE by the
Companys shareholders need not be further approved by the shareholders of the
Company in order to be fully effective and enforceable.

 

(d) _Insurance_. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
any person who was or is a Director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company, or was or is serving at the request of the Company as a Director,
officer, employee or agent of another Company, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against or incurred
by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as
such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person
against such liability under the provisions of this ARTICLE TWELVE.

 



D-8 (e) _Amendment_. This ARTICLE TWELVE may be hereafter amended or
repealed; however, no amendment or repeal shall reduce, terminate or
otherwise adversely affect the right of a person entitled to obtain
indemnification or an advance of expenses with respect to an action, suit or
proceeding that pertains to or arises out of actions or omissions that occur
prior to the later of (i) the effective date of such amendment or repeal; (ii)
the expiration date of such persons then current term of office with, or
service for, the Company (provided such person has a stated term of office or
service and completes such term); or (iii) the effective date such person
resigns his or her office or terminates his or her service (provided such
person has a stated term of office or service but resigns prior to the
expiration of such term).

ARTICLE THIRTEEN

 

The liability of the Companys directors to the Company or any of its
shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duties as a
director shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permitted under the
Missouri General and Business Corporation Law, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended. Neither any repeal or modification of this ARTICLE
THIRTEEN by the shareholders of the Company nor the amendment or adoption of
any other provision of the Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with this
ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall adversely affect any right or protection of a director
of the Company existing hereunder at the time of such repeal, modification or
amendment with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal,
modification or amendment.

Section 6\. At least ten (10) days before each meeting of the shareholders, a

shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual
business hours. Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and
place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any

these By-laws. The Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting or the
holders of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote at any meeting of the shareholders shall have the right

such question.

Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President of the Company, shall
convene all meetings of the shareholders and the Chairman of the Board shall
act as chairman thereof. The Board of Directors may appoint any shareholder
to act as chairman of any meeting of the shareholders in the absence of the
Chairman of the Board, and in the case of the failure of the Board so to
appoint a chairman, the shareholders present at the meeting shall elect a
chairman who shall be either a shareholder or a proxy of a shareholder.

The Secretary of the Company shall act as secretary of all meetings of
shareholders. In the absence of the Secretary at any meeting of shareholders,
the President or acting chairman may appoint any person to act as secretary of
the meeting.

 

Section 11\. At any meeting of shareholders where a vote by ballot is taken
for the election of directors or on any proposition, the person presiding at
such meeting shall appoint not less than two persons, who are not directors,
as inspectors to receive and canvass the votes given at such meeting and
certify the result to him. Subject to any statutory requirements which may
be applicable, all questions touching upon the qualification of voters, the
validity of proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided
by the inspectors. In case of a tie vote by the inspectors on any question,
the presiding officer shall decide the issue.

Section 12\. Unless otherwise provided by statute or by the Articles of
Incorporation, any action required to be taken by shareholders may be taken

shall be signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to
the subject matter thereof.

notice of such record date is first Publicly Disclosed (in the case of the
update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and as
promptly as practicable (in the case of any update or supplement required to
be made after the record date).

(5) This Section 13(a) is expressly intended to apply to any business
proposed to be brought before an annual meeting, regardless of whether or not
such proposal is made by means of an independently financed proxy
solicitation. In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 13(a),
each Proposing Person shall also comply with all applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 13(a).
This Section 13 shall not be deemed to affect (i) the rights of shareholders
to request inclusion of proposals in the Companys proxy statement pursuant
to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and, if required by such rule to be
included in the Companys proxy statement, to include a description of such
proposal in the notice of meeting and to be submitted for a shareholder vote
at the applicable meeting, or (ii) the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock if and to the extent provided under law, the Articles of
Incorporation or these By-laws.

 



E-7 (6) Notwithstanding satisfaction of the provisions of this Section 13(a), the
proposed business described in the notice may be deemed not to be properly
brought before the meeting if, pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation, the
By-laws, state law or any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, it was offered as a shareholder proposal and was omitted, or had
it been so offered, it could have been omitted, from the notice of, and proxy
material for, the meeting (or any supplement thereto) authorized by the Board
of Directors.

 

(7) In the event Timely Notice is given pursuant to Section 13(a)(2) and the
business described therein is not disqualified pursuant to this Section
13(a), such business may be presented by, and only by, the shareholder who
shall have given the notice required by this Section 13(a), or a
representative of such shareholder who is qualified under the law of the State

meeting.

(8) Notwithstanding anything in these By-laws to the contrary: (i) no

the procedures set forth in this Section 13(a) or, subject to Section 13(a)(1)
or Section 13(a)(5), as permitted under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act
(other than the nomination of a person for election as a director, which is
governed by Section 13(b)), and (ii) unless otherwise required by law, if a
Proposing Person intending to propose business at an annual meeting pursuant
to Section 13(a)(1)(iii) does not provide the information required under
Section 13(a)(2)-(4) within the periods specified therein, or the shareholder
who shall have given the notice required by Section 13(a) (or a qualified

the proposed business, such business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding
that proxies in respect of such business may have been received by the
Company. The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13(a) and
any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be
transacted. The requirements of this Section 13(a) are included to provide the
Company notice of a shareholders intention to bring business before an annual
meeting and shall in no event be construed as imposing upon any shareholder
the requirement to seek approval from the Company as a condition precedent to
bringing any such business before an annual meeting.

(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors at an annual
meeting or special meeting (but only if the Board of Directors has first

the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which such nominees or increased size was first Publicly

Disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and
stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Company.

 

(8) In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 13(b), each

(9) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 13(b) shall be eligible to serve as directors. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws, the
chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a
nomination was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 13(b) and, if any proposed nomination is not in compliance with this
Section 13(b), to declare that such defective nomination shall be

shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 13
is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the
meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedure set

shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the
Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of
directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election
to such position(s) as specified in the Companys notice of meeting, if the

delegate such shareholders right of inspection to a certified or
public accountant on the condition, to be enforced at the option of the
Company, that the shareholder and accountant agree with the Company to furnish
to the Company promptly a true and correct copy of each report with respect to
such inspection made by such accountant. No shareholder shall use, permit to
be used or acquiesce in the use by others of any information so obtained to
the detriment competitively of the Company, nor shall he or she furnish or
permit to be furnished any information so obtained to any competitor or
prospective competitor of the Company. The Company as a condition precedent to
any shareholders inspection of the records of the Company may require the
shareholder to indemnify the Company, in such manner and for such amount as
may be determined by the Board of Directors, against any loss or damage which
may be suffered by it arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized
disclosure made or permitted to be made by such shareholder of information
obtained in the course of such inspection.

connection with any inspection of its books.

by a majority vote of the shareholders present and entitled to vote at such
meeting, provided a quorum is present.

 



E-22 EXHIBIT F

 

REGULATORY COMMITMENTS

GPE and Westar agree that the initial applications submitted to the Kansas
Corporation Commission ("KCC") and the Missouri Public Service Commission
("MPSC") with respect to the Merger will include specific commitments and
agreements consistent with the items set forth below.

1\. _Customer Rates_



     | a. | _Goodwill_  GPE and Westar agree not to seek rate recovery
of any goodwill recorded in connection with the Merger. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | _Transaction Costs_  GPE and Westar will agree not to seek
rate recovery of any transaction costs (including advisory fees and change of
control severance costs) incurred in connection with the Merger.  
---|---|--- 



     | c. | _Transition Costs_  GPE and Westar will agree that their
utility operations shall be required to attest in all future rate proceedings
before the KCC and MPSC that no transition costs in excess of
their corresponding benefits are included in cost of service and rates. This
commitment shall be required until all transition costs are fully amortized.
Transition costs are those costs incurred to integrate GPE and Westar under
common ownership and include integration planning and execution and costs to
achieve merger savings. Transition costs can be ongoing costs or one-time
costs. Utility operations transition costs, which shall include but not be
limited to severance payments made to employees other than those required to
be made under change of control agreements, can be deferred and considered for
recovery in future rate cases. If subsequent rate recovery is sought, each of
GPE and Westar agree that the utility will have the burden of proof to
demonstrate that recovery of such transition costs is just and reasonable as
their incurrence facilitated the ability to provide benefits to its customers. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | d. | _Rate Case Filing Plans_  GPE and Westar plan, consistent
with their current respective business plans, to file general rate proceedings
in 2018 for each of their electric operations. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | e. | _Allocation of Costs Among Affiliates_  GPE and Westar
agree that each of their utility operations will provide an updated cost
allocation manual to the KCC and MPSC within six (6) months of the closing of
the Merger explaining the basis of allocation factors used to assign costs to
each utility, and will further agree that the KCC and MPSC may examine
accounting records of its affiliates to determine the reasonableness of such
allocation factors and cost assignments. 
---|---|--- 
 



F-1 2\. _Financial integrity_

 



     | a. | _Protection from Adverse Capital Cost Impacts_  GPE and
Westar will agree that capital costs used to set rates shall not increase as a
result of the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | _Transaction Financing_  No new debt will be issued to
close the Merger. Regardless, GPE and Westar will agree that their electric
utility operations customers shall not bear any financing costs associated
with the Merger. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | _Capital Structures_  Post-Merger, the new holding company
and its utility subsidiaries will maintain separate capital structures to
finance the activities and operations of each entity unless
otherwise approved by the KCC or MPSC, as applicable. The new holding company
and its utility subsidiaries will maintain separate debt, which is separately
rated by national credit rating agencies, so that none will be responsible for
the debts of affiliated companies and separate preferred stock, if any,
unless otherwise authorized by the KCC or MPSC, as applicable. The new holding
company and its utility subsidiaries will maintain investment grade credit
ratings. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | d. | _Other Financing-Related Matters_  GPE and Westar will
agree that, except for guarantees between Westar and its subsidiaries, the new
holding company and its utility subsidiaries shall not guarantee notes
(or enter into make-well agreements, etc.) of one another, or the new holding
company or any of the new holding companys other affiliates, absent prior
approval of the KCC or MPSC, as applicable; that no utility stock or assets
shall be pledged as collateral for obligations of any entity other than the
utility absent prior approval of the KCC or MPSC, as applicable; and that each
utility subsidiary shall be held harmless from any business and financial risk
exposures associated with another utility subsidiary, the new holding company
or its other affiliates. 
---|---|--- 

3\. _Cost Savings_  GPE and Westar expect to realize approximately $40
million of net cost savings in 2018, growing to approximately $160 million in
2022 and beyond. These cost savings are comprised of non-fuel operations and
maintenance, fuel, and inventory carrying costs.

 

4\. _Employees_  GPE and Westar will agree that no involuntary severance of
employees shall occur as a result of the Merger. GPE and Westar will also
agree that no involuntary severance of employees shall occur as a result of
closing the following generating facilities: Sibley (units 1, 2 and 3),
Montrose (units 1, 2 and 3), Lake Road (unit 4/6), Tecumseh, Gordon Evans and
Murray Gill.

5\. _Capital Requirements_  GPE and Westar acknowledge that their utility
operations need significant amounts of capital to invest in energy supply and
delivery infrastructure (including, but not limited to, renewable energy
resources and other environmental sustainability initiatives such as energy
efficiency and demand response programs) and acknowledge that meeting these
capital requirements will be considered a high priority

 



F-2  by the new holding companys board of directors and executive management and
that the new holding companys access to capital post-Merger will permit it
and its utility subsidiaries to satisfy all of such capital requirements.

6\. _Service Quality and Reliability_  GPE and Westar will agree to
reasonable conditions, including compliance with KCC standards issued in
Docket No. 02-GIME-365-GIE, regarding customer service quality and reliability
reporting.

 

7\. _Books, Records and Information_  GPE and Westar agree that the new
holding company and its utility subsidiaries and other affiliates will
maintain separate books and records and will agree to reasonable conditions
regarding access by regulators to information, books and records.

 

8\. _Collective Bargaining_  GPE and Westar will honor all existing
collective bargaining agreements.

 

9\. _Low-Income Assistance_  GPE and Westar will agree that each of their
utility operations will maintain and promote low-income assistance programs
consistent with those in place prior to the Merger.

10\. _Charitable and Community Involvement_  GPE and Westar will maintain
aggregate Kansas and Missouri charitable contributions and community support
at 2015 levels for at least five years after closing of the Merger.
