-iv-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated January 26, 2012 (as may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its
terms, this " _Agreement_ "), by and among Solutia Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Eastman Chemical Company, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Eagle Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and indirect Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

RECITALS 

A. The Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with the Company
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "
_Merger_ "), with the Company being the surviving corporation in the Merger.

B. The parties desire to make or enter into certain representations,
warranties and covenants in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

 

C. In connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain financial institutions have executed and delivered one or
more commitment letters with respect to certain debt facilities, the proceeds
of which, among other uses, will be used by Parent to fund the payment of
a portion of the Merger Consideration (such commitment letters, the " _Debt
Commitment Letters_ ").

D. In connection with the Transactions, the Company and the American Transfer
and Trust Company, LLC (the " _Rights Agent_ ") will amend the Rights Agreement
to make its provisions inapplicable to the Merger, the payments of the
Merger Consideration, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Transactions_ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

 

The Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the
surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and will succeed to
and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with
the DGCL.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger
will take place at the offices of Jones Day, 1420 Peachtree Street, N.E.,
Suite 800, Atlanta, Georgia 30309 at 10:00 a.m. local time on the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law,
waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (other than those
conditions that by  their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of those conditions at
Closing) (the date of such satisfaction or waiver, the " _Condition
Satisfaction Date_ "), but in the event that the Condition Satisfaction Date
occurs prior to May 31, 2012, Parent may elect (by delivery of written notice
to the Company by such date) to delay the Closing to a later date (but in no
case later than 20 Business Days following the Condition Satisfaction Date) if
Parent permanently and unconditionally waives any further reliance on any of
the conditions to Closing set forth in either  _Section 7.1_ or _Section
7.2_. In lieu of the foregoing, the Closing may occur at such other place,
time and date as may be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (collectively,
the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and will make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such
other time as Parent and the Company will agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in Section
259 of the DGCL.

Section 1.5 _Conversion of Securities_. (a) _Conversion of Company Common
Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of the Company
Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Share_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares and any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_) will be
converted automatically into the right to receive, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, (i) $22.00 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "),
without interest, and (ii) 0.120 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of validly
issued, fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable in the manner set forth in _Section 2.1_.
Except as set forth in _Section 1.5(b)_, as a result of the Merger, each
holder of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (" _Certificates_ ") and each
holder of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
not represented by Certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") will thereafter
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except (x) the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_, in each case to be issued or paid,
without interest, in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ (or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, _Section 2.1(j))_ or (y) as provided
by Law.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each Share held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled without any conversion
thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect thereto.

 



2 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub will be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.6 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. (a) At the Effective Time,
the Companys certificate of incorporation will, by virtue of the Merger, be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation will remain "Solutia
Inc.", and as so amended and restated will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Companys bylaws will, by virtue of the Merger,
be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of
the Surviving Corporation will remain "Solutia Inc.", and as so amended and
restated will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.7 _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time will become the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

 

Section 1.8 _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time will become the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,
as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE II DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

Section 2.1 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will designate a commercial bank or trust company
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company to act as agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration and enter into an agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to
be performed by the Exchange Agent. Parent will deposit or will cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent (by instruction to Parents transfer agent)
at or prior to the Effective Time, (i) certificates representing the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_ (or make
appropriate alternative arrangements if uncertificated shares of Parent Common
Stock represented by a book entry will be issued), (ii) cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)_ and (iii) cash in an amount sufficient to make all requisite payments
of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_ (such
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so made available to the
Exchange Agent are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
cash portion of the Exchange Fund will be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by Parent. Any interest or other income from such

 



3  investments will be paid to and become income of Parent. In the event of
loss from such investments or in the event that the Exchange Fund will be
insufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration, Parent will promptly
deposit, or caused to be deposited, such additional Merger Consideration with
the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such delivery. Except as contemplated by _Section 2.1(g)_,
the Exchange Fund will not be used for any purpose other than as specified in
this _Section 2.1(a)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. (i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person
who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_: (A) a letter
of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holders
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal.
Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares will be effected in accordance with the
Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to securities represented
by book entry.

 

 (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (A) the holder of such Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1) cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_ and this _ARTICLE II_ , (2) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by a book entry) representing the Stock Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_ and this _ARTICLE II_ after applying the Exchange Ratio, (3) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and (4) any dividends or other distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section 2.1(c);_ and (B) the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by _Section 1.5(a)_ and this _Section 2.1_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender, in each case, without interest, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. 

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with a record date after
the Effective Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock (and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1(e)_) will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share until the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share will surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with

 



4   _Section 2.1(b)_. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with  _Section 2.1(b)_, there will be paid to the record
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, at the appropriate payment date (or, if previously paid, promptly),
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_.

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration
issued or paid upon surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE II_ (including any cash
paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ or _Section 2.1(e)_) will be deemed to
have been issued or paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same will be issued
upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights (including the right to receive dividends or other
distributions of Parent) of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of a
fractional share interest (rounded to three decimal places after applying the
Exchange Ratio, and after taking into account all fractional share interests
held by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash
(without interest, rounded down to the nearest whole cent and subject to the
amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated in _Section 2.1(i)_) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to
which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests
then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Average
Parent Stock Price. The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

(f) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio will be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a
Subsidiary of Parent or the Company or of securities convertible into Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends
(excluding regular quarterly dividends at the currently announced level),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to
the holders of Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_ will thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to
_Section 1.5(a)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to
which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_.

 



5 (h) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock) or other cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date that
is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent, Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, any provision
of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_.

Section 2.2 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company will be closed and there will be no further registration
of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason will be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to which the holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_.

Section 2.3 _Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company RSUs,
Company Performance Shares and Company Warrants_.

 



6 (a) _Company Stock Options_. Each Company Stock Option which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or
exercisable) will at the Effective Time be cancelled and terminated at the
Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a cash amount equal to the
Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to
the Company Stock Option. The Option Consideration will be paid by the
Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, (i)
" _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common
Stock issuable under a particular Company Stock Option, an amount, if any, by
which (A) the Cash Out Amount exceeds (B) the exercise price payable in
respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the " _Cash Out Amount_ " is the sum of (A) the Cash
Consideration and (B) the Average Parent Stock Price multiplied by the number
of full and fractional shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Stock
Consideration.

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
restricted stock award granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan ("
_Company Restricted Stock_ ") the restrictions on which have not lapsed
immediately prior to the Effective Time will become fully vested and
the holder thereof will be entitled to receive, without any interest thereon,
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _ARTICLES I_ and _II_ hereof, less
applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to
such payment.

(c) _Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock
unit with respect to shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company RSUs_ ")
will be converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Cash Out Amount, to be paid in accordance with the applicable terms and
conditions of such Company RSU.

(d) _Company Performance Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
performance share or performance share unit award granted under the Company
Equity Incentive Plan (a " _Company Performance Share_ ") the restrictions of
which have not lapsed immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest
according to the award provisions and therefore vest based on no greater than
the performance results for the applicable performance period, and the holder
thereof will be entitled to receive (i) in the case of Company Performance
Shares in the form of restricted stock, the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, in accordance with ARTICLES I and II hereof, less applicable
withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such
payment and (ii) in the case of Company Performance Shares in the form of
restricted stock units, cash in an amount equal to the Cash Out Amount, to be
paid in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of such Company
Performance Share _._

(e) _Company Warrants_. As of the Effective Time, each warrant issued pursuant
to the Warrant Agreement (the " _Warrant Agreement_ "), dated February 28,
2008, between the Company and the Rights Agent, as warrant agent, (a "
_Company Warrant_ ") outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable or vested, will be adjusted as necessary (including by way of
amending the Warrant Agreement) to provide in accordance with Section 5.4(e)
of the Warrant Agreement that, at the Effective Time, the obligations with
respect to each Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be assumed by Parent without any action on the part of the
holder thereof and will be converted into a warrant of Parent to acquire upon
exercise, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable

 



7  under such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time other
than changes that are immaterial to the holder of any such Company Warrant and
are permitted by the Warrant Agreement, the per share Merger Consideration.
Parent will notify the Company at least five Business Days prior to the date
the Effective Time is expected to occur and deliver the notice contemplated in
Section 5.4(g) of the Warrant Agreement. Following the Effective Time, Parent
will reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued upon exercise of the Company Warrants.

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and are held by a stockholder (each, a " _Dissenting
Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to exercise, and properly exercises,
dissenters rights with respect to such shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into or
exchangeable for or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(except as provided in this _Section 2.4_) and will entitle such Dissenting
Stockholder only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as may
be determined to be due to the holder of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder
withdraws (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal. If any
Dissenting Stockholder will have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with
Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
the right to appraisal, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting
Stockholder will be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to
receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration in accordance
with _ARTICLES I_ and _II_ hereof, less applicable withholding taxes, if any,
required to be withheld. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares
will not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record prior to the Effective Time). The Company
will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
(or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or
settle or make a binding offer to settle with (unless it results in the
withdrawal of an appraisal demand), any Dissenting Stockholder regarding its
exercise of dissenters rights prior to the Effective Time. The Company will
give Parent notice of any such demands prior to the Effective Time,
and Parent will have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any exercise by any stockholder of dissenters
rights.

Section 2.5 _Tax Treatment_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree and
acknowledge that the Merger will be treated as a taxable purchase of the
Shares for the Merger Consideration (and not as a "reorganization" described
in Section 368(a) of the Code) for United States federal income tax purposes.

as applicable, since January 1, 2010 (collectively, and in each case including
all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein, as such statements and reports may have been amended since the date
of their filing, the " _Company Reports"_ ). As of their respective effective
dates (in the case of Company Reports that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities
Act_ ")) and as of their respective filing or furnished dates, as applicable
(in the case of all other Company Reports), or in the case of amendments
thereto, as of the most recent such amendment, the Company Reports complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and SOX, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder, applicable to such Company Reports, and none of the Company
Reports as of such respective dates (or, if amended, the date of the filing or
furnishing, as applicable, of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures
that are amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

(b) No Company Reports filed pursuant to the Securities Act or filed or
furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange
Act_ "), and the respective rules and regulations thereunder, since December
31, 2010, as of the date of such Company Report (or, if amended prior to the
date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last amendment and filing
thereof), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. All Company Reports filed under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act since December 31, 2010, as of their
respective dates, complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

 

(c) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal

15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, "
_SOX_ ") with respect to the Company Reports and the statements contained in
such

 



12  certifications are complete and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,

meanings ascribed to such terms in SOX. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has since December 31, 2010 arranged
any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to or for directors or executive
officers of the Company in violation of Section 402 of SOX.

(d) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the

conformity with GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that receipts and
expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorizations of management
and directors and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.

(e) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by the Company are reasonably
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information required to be
disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
enable the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

(f) Since December 31, 2010, the Company has not received any written
notification of any (i) "significant deficiency" or (ii) "material weakness"

of the Company, there is no outstanding "significant deficiency" or "material
weakness" that has not been appropriately and adequately remedied by the
Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30,
2011 (the " _Company Financial Statements_ "), and all other balance sheets
and statements of income and cash flows of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries filed with the SEC thereafter on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, fairly

13  and the Company Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
date therein set forth, except the Company Financial Statements are subject to
normal year-end audit adjustments in amounts that are immaterial in amount
and are consistent with past experience. Each of the Company Financial
Statements (including the related notes, where applicable), as of their
respective dates, complied in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and each of such statements
(including the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto.

(b) Except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on
the September 30, 2011 consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries included in the Company Financial Statements and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2011 or as otherwise contemplated by this

Parent Reports, and none of the Parent Reports as of such respective dates
(or, if amended, the date of the filing or furnishing, as applicable, of such
amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact

the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to

to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information required to be disclosed is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent to make
the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
enforceability. Parent has fully paid, or is paying, substantially
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any and
all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Commitment
Letters that are payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement. The net
proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters will, together with cash
and cash equivalents available to Parent and committed credit facilities in
the aggregate, be sufficient to consummate the Transactions upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith, including payment of all amounts under _ARTICLE I_ of
this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy any term or condition of closing to
be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date
of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letters or that would,
individually or in the aggregate, permit the financial institutions party
thereto to terminate, or to not make the initial funding of the facilities to
be established

 



33  thereunder upon satisfaction of all conditions thereto; _provided_ that
Parent is not making any representations in this _Section 4.18_ regarding the
effect of the inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties in
_ARTICLE II_. Except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, there are no
(i) conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the lenders
specified in the Debt Commitment Letters to fund the full amount of the
Financing; or (ii) contractual contingencies under any agreements, side
letters or arrangements relating to the Financing to which either Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party that would permit
the lenders specified in the Debt Commitment Letters to reduce the total
amount of the Financing (other than retranching or reallocating the Financing
in a manner that does not reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing), or
that would materially and adversely affect the availability of the Financing.

Section 4.19 _Opinions_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Parent
Board has received an opinion from each of Barclays Capital Inc. and Citigroup
Global Markets, Inc. to the effect that as of the date thereof and based upon
and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is
fair to the Company from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been
amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

Section 4.20 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4,
or the information relating to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries that is or
will be provided by Parent or its Representatives for inclusion in any other
document filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection with the
Transactions, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Form S-4 (except for such portions thereof that relate only to
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Form S-4 will comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder in all material respects.

Section 4.21 _Application of Takeover Protections; Rights Agreement_. Parent
and the Parent Board have taken all necessary action, if any, in order to
render inapplicable to the Transactions any restriction on business
combinations contained in any applicable control share acquisition,
interested stockholder, business combination, or similar statute which is or
would reasonably be expected to become applicable to the Company as a result
of the Transactions, including, without limitation, the Merger. Neither the
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any stockholder rights
agreement, rights plan or other similar agreement or plan.

Section 4.22  _Share Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has been, at
any time during the three years preceding the date hereof, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. As of the
date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any shares
of capital stock of the Company and none of Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates holds any rights to acquire any shares of capital stock
of the Company except pursuant to this Agreement.

 



34 Section 4.23 _Broker s Fees_. None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any
of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker or finder
or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees
in connection with the Merger, other than Barclays Capital Inc. and Citigroup
Global Markets, Inc.

Section 4.24 _Vote Required_. No vote of the holders of any class or series of
Parent capital stock or indebtedness is necessary to approve the Transactions
(including the Merger).

Section 4.25 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly made by Parent and Merger Sub in this
_ARTICLE IV_ , neither Parent nor any other Person makes any representation or
warranty with respect to the Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or their
respective business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any documentation,
forecasts or other information with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing.

Consents_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Transaction to be consummated as soon as reasonably
practicable.

 

(b) Parent and the Company will cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, prepare
and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent will as promptly as
practicable prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4 of which the Proxy
Statement will form a part. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts, and
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent, in
the preparation and filing of the Form S-4 (including cooperating with the
preparation of any financial statement or other financial information relating
to such party and required to be included therein) and to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to,
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon and without the consent of the other party, which
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any filings with the SEC
deemed to supplement the Form S-4 or any document which forms a part thereof
through its incorporation by reference therein or with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Change of Recommendation or any
matters relating thereto. Parent or the Company, as applicable, will advise
the other party promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time
when the Form S-4 has or will become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written

omission relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the
Company which should be set forth in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so
that any of such documents do not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information or omission will
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

 

(c) The parties will cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions (including the Merger)
and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. The Company
and Parent will have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing right, each
of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions and each party
will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the Transactions.

the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,

any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions.

(e) Each of Parent and the Company will promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity consent or approval
of which is required for consummation of the Transactions.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will promptly take, in order to
consummate the Transactions, all actions necessary (i) to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any antitrust or
competition Law required by any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign
antitrust or competition Governmental Entity (the " _Antitrust Clearance_ "),
in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to close
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event no later than three Business Days prior to the
Termination Date) and (ii) to prevent the entry of, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment, Injunction or other
order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
Transaction,

 



41  in each case including (A) executing settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity, (B)
selling, divesting, licensing, holding separate or otherwise conveying
particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of Parent, its
Affiliates and the Company, (C) terminating, relinquishing, modifying, or
waiving existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or

(D) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective Subsidiaries.
Parent will respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as practicable any
objections that are raised and refrain from taking any action that would
reasonably be expected to impede or delay Antitrust Clearance (and in any
event no later than three Business Days prior to the Termination Date). No
actions taken pursuant to this _Section 6.1(f)_ will be considered for
purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
Parent has occurred.

 

Section 6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice, the Company
will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, lenders, financial advisors and
other Representatives of Parent reasonable access during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time to all the Companys and its
Subsidiaries owned or leased properties (but not for purposes of any
environmental sampling and analysis of the nature), books, Contracts,
commitments, personnel (including contractors and distributors), records and
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that Parent and its Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ further that the Company and its Subsidiaries will
not be required to provide any access or disclose any information if such
access or disclosure would contravene any applicable Law or where such access
or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Only for purposes related to the Transactions and upon reasonable
notice, Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the Company
and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, lenders, financial
advisors and other Representatives of the Company, reasonable access during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all
Parents and its respective Subsidiaries books, Contracts, commitments,
personnel (including contractors and distributors), records and all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the Company
may reasonably request; _provided_ that the Company and its Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of Parent; _provided_ further
that Parent will not be required to provide any access or disclose any
information if such access or disclosure would contravene any applicable Law
or where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or
contravene any fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement.

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement will be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between the Company and Parent as of December 9, 2011 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 



42 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives will affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.3 _Stockholder Approval_. The Company will call a meeting of its
stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC staff for mailing to consider and vote on the
adoption of this Agreement and any other matters required to be voted upon by
the Companys stockholders in connection with the Transactions (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will be permitted to delay or
postpone convening the Company Stockholders Meeting if the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof), after consultation with outside legal
counsel, reasonably believes that failure to delay or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
obligations or duties under applicable Law. Subject to and until the Company
Board effects a Change of Recommendation pursuant to  _Section 6.10(d)_, the
Company Board will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section 6.10(d)_,
the Company Board will recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). Subject
to the Companys right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 8.4(a)_,
the Company and Parent agree that the Companys obligations pursuant to the
first two sentences of this _Section 6.3_ will not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or by the withdrawal or modification by the
Company Board, of the Company Board Recommendation.

Section 6.4 _NYSE Listing_. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued, or reserved for issuance, in
connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Affiliates to continue the employment effective immediately after the Closing
Date of all employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Company
Employees_ "), including each such employee on medical, disability, family or
other leave of absence as of the Closing Date. Until at least the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, the continued employment immediately
following the Closing Date of each such Company Employee will in each case
provide at least the same base wages, annual base salary and annual rate of
bonus potential (determined as a percentage of annual base salary) (but
excluding any equity plan program or arrangement or Parent sponsored severance
plan) provided to each such Company Employee on the Closing Date. Nothing in
this  _Section 6.5(a)_ will obligate Parent, Surviving Corporation or the
Company to continue the employment of any such Company Employee for any
specific period.

(b) _Employee Benefits_. As of the Closing Date and for a period not to end
before December 31, 2012, Parent will provide, and will cause its Affiliates
to provide, each Company Employee with employee benefits (excluding any
equity based compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to
the employee benefits provided by the Company to Company Employees as of the
date of this Agreement. As of the Closing Date and for a period not to end
before December 31, 2014, in the event that a Company Employee terminates

 



43  employment from Parent or its Affiliates after the Closing, Parent will
provide, or will cause its Affiliates to provide, each such Company Employee
with severance benefits, if eligible therefore, equal to those provided under
a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to
participate before the Effective Time, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and after applying the service crediting provisions set forth in
Section 6.5(c).

(c) _Employee Service Credit_. Parent (i) will give, and cause its Affiliates
to give, each Company Employee service credit granted by the Company prior to
Closing under any comparable Company Benefit Plan for all purposes (including
eligibility to participate, vesting in eligible benefits and levels of
benefits) other than for benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit
pension plan; _provided_ that Company Employees will not be entitled to the
benefit of any grandfathered benefit formula that would not be provided to any
employee first hired by Parent on or after the Effective Time, (ii) will
give, and cause its Affiliates to give, each Company Employee service credit
granted by the Company prior to Closing under any comparable personnel
policies that cover such Company Employee after the Closing Date, including
any severance, vacation and sick leave, for purposes of entitlement to
benefits thereunder, (iii) will allow, and cause its Affiliates to allow, such
Company Employees to participate in each Company Benefit Plan
providing welfare benefits (including medical, life insurance, long-term
disability insurance and long-term care insurance) in the plan year in which
the Closing occurs without regard to preexisting-condition limitations,
waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations,
and (iv) will credit, and cause its Affiliates to credit, the Company Employee
with any expenses that were covered by the Company Benefit Plans for purposes
of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under the
Company Benefit Plan in which they participate and any similar replacement
plans.

(d)  _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. Parent will continue, and cause
its Affiliates to continue, to credit to each Company Employee all vacation
and personal holiday pay that the Company Employee is entitled to use but has
not used as of the Closing Date (including any earned vacation or personal
holiday pay to be used in future years) subject to Parents vacation day
carryover policy.

(e) _Labor Agreements_. As of and after the Closing, subject to mutually
agreed upon modifications by the parties thereto, the Surviving Corporation or
its relevant Subsidiaries will continue (for so long as such contracts are in
effect) to be bound by the agreements set forth in _Section 3.10(m)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(f) _Certain Commitments_. From and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
honor, and shall cause its Affiliates to honor, all obligations under the
Company Benefit Plans and compensation and severance arrangements (subject to
Parents commitments in Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(b)) and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, and (ii) Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, treat the
Transactions as constituting a "change in control," "change of control" or
similar terms under the Company Benefit Plans and such compensation and
severance arrangements or agreements. 

(g) _Bonus Plans_. Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, operate the
Annual Incentive Plan and all other annual bonus arrangements (collectively,
" _Bonus Plans_ "), as applicable, for 2012 in accordance with the terms
established by the Company Board (or a duly

 



44  authorized committee thereof) within sixty days following the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that, to the extent applicable, performance goals under
such Bonus Plans established in the ordinary course of business will be
reasonably adjusted by Parent in good faith to reflect the consummation of the
Transactions.

(h) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement will create any
right or obligation which is enforceable by any employee, former employee,
Company Employee or any other Person with respect to any terms or conditions
of employment, including, but not limited to, the benefits and compensation
described in this _Section 6.5_. For the avoidance of doubt, any amendments
to the Companys, the Company Subsidiaries, Parents and the Surviving
Corporations benefit and compensation plans, programs or arrangements will
occur only in accordance with their respective terms and will be pursuant to
action taken by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation which are independent of the consummation of this
Agreement or any continuing obligations hereunder.

Section 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From
and after the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless (including by advancing expenses) each current and
former director, officer and employee of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
(each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission relating to their position with the
Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at
the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to the
Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law. Each of (x) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and the
respective organizational documents of each of the Companys Subsidiaries as
currently in effect, (y) any indemnification agreements with an Indemnified
Party listed on _Section 6.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, which
shall in each case survive the Transactions and continue in full force and
effect to the extent permitted by applicable Law and (z) the respective
organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries as currently in effect
shall not, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties except, in the case of clauses
(x) and (z), as required by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing,
at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to cause the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to include provisions for limitation of
liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Parties no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties than as set forth in the Company Charter and Company
Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties except as required by applicable Law. 

 



45 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from the
Companys current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (the " _D andO Insurance_") for the persons who, as of the
date of this Agreement, are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance.
Such "tail" insurance policies shall have terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing DandO
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum aggregate premium
for such insurance policies for any such year shall not be in excess of the
Maximum Premium. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such
"tail" insurance policies in full force and effect for their full term. If
the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect, at no expense to the Indemnified Parties, for a period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the Companys DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or, if such
insurance is unavailable, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase the best available DandO
Insurance for such six-year period from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to the Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions
and with levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay
an aggregate premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "); and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 



46 Section 6.7 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, in case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of the Company, the
then-current officers and directors of each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries will use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all such
actions as may be reasonably requested by Parent. 

Section 6.8 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and the Company will promptly
advise the other of any change or event, of which it has knowledge, (i)
having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, or (ii) that would or would be reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement if it would result in the
failure of closing conditions in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ or
_Section 7.2(a)_ or  _Section 7.2(b)_, respectively, by the Termination
Date, except that (A) no such notification will affect the representations,
warranties or covenants of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement and (B)
a failure to comply with this _Section 6.8_ will not constitute the failure
of any condition set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ to be satisfied unless the
underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently
result in the failure of a condition set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ to be
satisfied.

Section 6.9 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Parent and the
Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Company
Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective
Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion of Shares into
shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and for compensatory and
retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this _Section 6.9_. Assuming
that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information in a timely
fashion, the Parent Board, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange
Act), will adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by Company Insiders
of shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Shares pursuant to the
Transactions, to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information, is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b)
under the Exchange Act. 

Section 6.10 _Company Board Recommendation; Acquisition Proposals_. (a)
Subject to the provisions of this  _Section 6.10_, the Company will not, nor
will it authorize or permit any of the Company Subsidiaries to, and will cause
the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and
employees not to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives not to, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage the
submission of, or, other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in
this _Section 6.10_, participate or engage in any negotiations or
discussions with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) disclose or
furnish any nonpublic information or data concerning the Company to any Person
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or afford any Person other
than Parent or its Representatives access to the properties, books or records
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal, except as required by Law, pursuant to a request for
information of any Governmental Entity or in accordance with,

 



47  and pursuant to _Section 6.10(b)_ or (iii) enter into or execute, or
propose to enter into or execute, any Acquisition Agreement. The Company will,
and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers, directors and employees, and will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause other Representatives of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations
with any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives) that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding
any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, and request from each Person that has executed a
confidentiality agreement with the Company within the last 12 months related
to any Acquisition Proposal the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to such Person or its
Representatives and terminate access by each such Person and its
Representatives (to the extent such request has not yet been made as of the
date hereof) to any online or other data rooms containing any information in
respect of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries related to any such
proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to receiving the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and
its Representatives may, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not
otherwise result from a breach of  _Section 6.10(a)_, participate in
discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, making any
counterproposal) with, or (only after any such Person(s) enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) furnish any nonpublic information or
data to, or afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company
to, the Person or Persons, making such Acquisition Proposal and their
respective Representatives and potential sources of financing, if the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
will not grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill agreement
unless the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
grant any such waiver, amendment or release would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors obligations or duties under applicable Law.
All non-public written information provided to a third party under this
_Section 6.10(b)_ will be provided or made available on a prior or
substantially concurrent basis to Parent if such information has not
previously been provided to Parent.

 

(c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within 24 hours after receipt, notify Parent orally and in writing within one
Business Day of the receipt by the Company (to its knowledge) of any
Acquisition Proposal. The written notice will include the identity of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms of the
Acquisition Proposal (including any material written amendments or
modifications thereto). The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a
prompt basis of any material changes with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(d) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 6.10_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof will, (i) (A) withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Board Recommendation, (B) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) in the event of a
tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding shares of

 



48  Company Capital Stock, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Companys stockholders within ten Business Days
of the commencement thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no
position or a neutral position by the Company Board in respect of the
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders as of the
end of the ten day Business Day period will constitute a failure to recommend
against any such offer); or (D) recommend that the Companys stockholders
reject adoption of this Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions (any action
described in clauses ( _A_ )-( _D_ ) above being referred to as a " _Change
of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) allow the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar agreement (I) providing for any Acquisition Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to  _Section 6.10(b)_)
(an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (II) requiring it to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Transactions.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) solely in response to a
Superior Proposal which did not otherwise result from a breach of _Section
6.10(a)_, the Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation and
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.4(a)_ in order to cause the
Company to concurrently approve, adopt, recommend, accept or enter into an
Acquisition Agreement related to a Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board
may effect a Change of Recommendation, only if and to the extent that (A) in
the case of each of clause ( _i_ ) and clause ( _ii_ ) above, the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that failing to
take any such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors obligations or duties under applicable Law and (B) solely with
respect to clause (i) above, at least four Business Days have elapsed since
the Companys delivery to Parent of written notice (it being understood that
such notice shall not in itself be deemed a Change of Recommendation) advising
Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action, specifying the
terms and conditions of the applicable Superior Proposal, including the
identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (I) with respect to any applicable Superior Proposal, any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal will
require a new written notice by the Company (it being understood that such
notice shall not in itself be deemed a Change of Recommendation) but in the
case of any such new written notice, all references in this clause (B) to a
four Business Day period shall be deemed to refer to a two (2) Business Day
period, and no such termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)
_by the Company or withdrawal or modification of the Company Board
Recommendation may be made during any such four Business Day period, (II) the
Company will, and will cause its financial and legal advisors to, during such
four Business Day period described above, to the extent requested by Parent,
negotiate with Parent in good faith, to make such changes in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal or that the cause for such withdrawal or
modification of the Company Board Recommendation ceases to exist, as
applicable, if such changes were accepted by the Company, (III) at the end of
such period, the Company Board will take into account any written, binding
and irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the Company to amend the
financial and other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to
any such written notice by the Company or

  



49  otherwise and (IV) the requirements for terminating this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.4(a)_ or effecting a Change of Recommendation are still
satisfied at the time this Agreement is terminated or at the time of such
withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation, as applicable.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 of
the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the Company Boards determination in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with the directors obligations or duties under applicable Law.
It is further understood and agreed that a "stop, look and listen" disclosure
in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, a statement to any
person informing them of the existence of the provisions contained in this
_Section 6.10_ or a factually accurate public statement of the Company that
describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto will not constitute a Change of
Recommendation.

Section 6.11 _Control of the Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement will give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or will
give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 6.12 _Subsidiary Compliance_. Parent will cause Merger Sub to comply
with and perform all of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Merger Sub will not engage in any business which is not
in connection with the Merger. Parent will vote all of the shares of Merger
Sub in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.13 _Financing_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, and will not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, or (ii) impose
new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any
conditions, to the receipt of the Financing, in the case of either clause (
_i_ ) or ( _ii_ ) above, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A)
materially delay or prevent the Closing Date, (B) make the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing)
materially less likely to occur or (C) materially adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto, the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions or the likelihood of consummation of the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may (i) amend the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar 

 



50  entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of
this Agreement or (ii) otherwise amend or replace the Debt Commitment Letters
so long as (x) such amendment do not impose terms or conditions that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing, (y) the
terms are not, taken as a whole, materially less beneficial to Parent or
Merger Sub, with respect to conditionality, than those in the Debt Commitment
Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (z) with respect to
replacements, the replacement debt commitments otherwise satisfy the terms and
conditions of an Alternative Financing set forth below. In the event of such
amendment or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letters as permitted by the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the financing under such
amended or replaced Debt Commitment Letters will be deemed to be "
_Financing_ " as such term is used in this Agreement. Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to (I) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters
(including any definitive agreements entered into in connection
therewith), (II) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the Financing
Agreements applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing as
promptly as reasonably practicable, (III) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letters on terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters or consistent in all
material respects with the Debt Commitment Letters as promptly as reasonably
practicable (such definitive agreements, together with the Debt Commitment
Letters, the " _Financing Agreements_ ") and promptly upon execution thereof
provide complete executed copies of such definitive agreements to the Company,
(IV) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing and (V) fully
enforce the counterparties obligations and its rights under the Financing
Agreements, including by suit or other appropriate proceeding to cause the
lenders under the Financing to fund in accordance with their
respective commitments if all conditions to funding the Financing in the
applicable Financing Agreements have been satisfied or waived. Parent will
keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the status of
Parents and Merger Subs efforts to arrange the Financing and to satisfy the
conditions thereof, including, upon Companys reasonable request, (A) advising
and updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to
status, proposed Closing Date and material terms of the material definitive
documentation for the Financing and (B) providing copies of the current drafts
of all such definitive documentation. If any portion of that amount of the
Financing necessary to consummate the Transactions becomes reasonably likely
to be unavailable on the material terms and conditions contemplated by the
applicable Financing Agreements, (i) Parent will promptly notify the Company
and (ii) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions not materially less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company than the
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Financing Agreements ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event. In such event, (1) the term " _Financing_ " as used in this
Agreement will be deemed to include any such alternative debt financing, (2)
the term " _Financing_ " will be deemed to include the Alternative Financing,
(3) the term " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " will be deemed to include any
commitment letters with respect to any such alternative debt financing and (4)
the term " _Financing Agreements_ " will be deemed to include any definitive
agreement with respect to the Alternative Financing.

(b) The Company will provide to Parent, and will cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, at Parents cost and expense as provided in _Section 6.13(d)_, and
will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent

 



51  that is customary and necessary in connection with arranging, obtaining and
syndicating the Financing and causing the conditions in the Financing
Agreements to be satisfied, including using reasonable best efforts in (i)
assisting with the preparation of offering and syndication documents and
materials, including prospectuses, private placement memoranda, information
memoranda and packages, lender and investor presentations, rating agency
materials and presentations, and similar documents and materials, in
connection with the Financing, and providing reasonable and customary
authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and containing customary information (all
such documents and materials, collectively, the " _Offering Documents_ "),
(ii) preparing and furnishing to Parent and the Financing Sources as promptly
as practicable with all Required Information to the extent it is available to
the Company and all other information and disclosures relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including their businesses, operations, financial
projections and prospects) as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist
in preparation of the Offering Documents, (iii) having the Company designate a
member of senior management of the Company to participate in a reasonable
number of presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with ratings agencies in connection with the Financing,
including direct contact between such senior management of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Parents Financing Sources and potential lenders in the
Financing, (iv) assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family
ratings from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters,
(v) requesting the Companys independent auditors to cooperate with Parents
reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and consents
from the Companys independent auditors, (vi) assisting in the preparation of,
and executing and delivering, definitive financing documents, including
guarantee and collateral documents, hedging agreements and other certificates
and documents as may be requested by Parent, and (vii) subject to any
contractual agreement in effect facilitating the pledging of collateral for
the Financing, including taking commercially reasonable actions necessary to
permit the Financing Sources to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries
real property and current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements and establishing, as of the Effective Time, bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox arrangements in connection
with the Financing, (viii) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist
the Financing Sources in benefiting from the existing lending relationships of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (ix) obtaining from the Companys
existing lenders such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments
which may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing
and collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien
releases, instruments of termination or discharge, (x) preparing and
delivering to Parent any supplements to the above information as may be
required pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters and (xi) cooperating with
Parent to the extent within the control of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective
Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the
Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the
Surviving Corporation immediately upon the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) no obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
under any certificate, document, agreement or instrument will be effective
until the Effective Time, (B) none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
will be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time and (C)
none of the boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall

 



52  be required to enter into any resolutions or take similar action approving
the Financing. In connection with the foregoing, the Company will file with
the SEC all Company Reports for the annual and quarterly fiscal periods
ending on and after December 31, 2011 as soon as practicable but in any event
not later than the time period required by law. The Company hereby consents to
the use of the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing
in a form and manner mutually agreed with the Company; _provided_ , _however_
, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or
reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The
Company will, upon request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to
periodically update any Required Information (to the extent it is available)
to be included in any Offering Document to be used in connection with such
Financing so that Parent may ensure that any such Required Information does
not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading.

pill" unless the Company takes such action as is necessary to ensure that the

respect to the Merger and the conversion of the Company Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 1.5_. than the Rights Agreement as amended by the Rights

applicable percentage of beneficial ownership for purposes of determining

amended) or termination thereof.

parties hereto reasonably informed of, and cooperate with the other parties
hereto in connection with, any litigation or claim against any party hereto
and/or its directors, officers or employees relating to the Merger or the

an Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal or a Change of Recommendation or
any action taken pursuant thereto or (b) in connection with any dispute
between the parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_

hereto to make internal announcements to their respective employees and other

prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

warranties of Parent and the Company are made and given, and the covenants are
agreed to, subject to the disclosures and exceptions set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable. In no event

Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter in which they are directly or
indirectly referenced. The information contained in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter is in all events provided subject to
and on the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as though it were
Evaluation Material (as such term is defined therein) thereunder.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion
of an item therein as an exception to a representation or warranty will
not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or Parent, as the case may be.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and
will become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party
need not sign the same counterpart. 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement),
together with the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire
agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written

Agreement may be amended by the Company and Parent (on behalf of itself and
Merger Sub), by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with Merger by the stockholders of the Company, except that,
after any approval of the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company,
there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment
of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Shares, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

 

Section 9.7 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and (iii) waive

of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion
hereof that reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be
delivered to the holders of Shares under this Agreement, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
Contracts made and wholly performed within such state, without regard to any

Delaware) (collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), in any action or proceeding

recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to

any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, and (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the
Chosen Courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding will be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including but
not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letters or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts of the
State of New York (and appellate courts thereof). Each of the parties hereto

hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written

binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto

specifically, that irreparable damage would likewise occur if the Merger were
not consummated and the Companys stockholders did not receive the Merger
Consideration payable to them in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which they

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
without such rights, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party

Financing Source is such Financing Source has consented thereto or to the
extent that the consent of such Financing Source is not required to be
obtained under the applicable provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters
relating to waivers of this Agreement, only by a written instrument signed by
the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

Section 9.14 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable, such term, provision, covenant
