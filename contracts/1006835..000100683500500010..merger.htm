> Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:
>
>    
>
> 1. each share of the common stock (par value $0.001 per share) of the
> Company (the "Company Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the
> Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the "Applicable
> Fraction" (as defined in Section 1.5(b)) of a share of the common stock
> (par value $0.01 per share) of Parent ("Parent Common Stock");
>
>  
>
> 2. each share of the common stock (par value $0.001 per share) of
> Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

>  
>
> 3. all calculations under this Section 1.5(a) shall be rounded to the
> nearest one millionth (1/1,000,000th).
>
>   
>
> 2. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Applicable Fraction" shall be
> the fraction having: (A) a numerator equal to 3,706,564 and (B) a
> denominator equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
> Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
> (including any such shares that are subject to a repurchase option or risk
> of forfeiture under any restricted stock purchase agreement or other
> agreement), _plus_ (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
> Stock purchasable under or otherwise subject to all Company
> options, warrants or other rights to purchase Company Common Stock
> outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all shares
> of Company Common Stock that may ultimately be purchased under Company
> Options (as defined in Section 1.6 below), warrants or other rights to
> purchase Company Common Stock that are unvested or are otherwise not then
> exercisable). Subject only to Section 1.5(c), in no case shall the number
> of shares of Parent Common Stock issued under Section 1.5(a), when added to
> the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the holders of options,
> warrants and convertible debentures to purchase Company Common Stock under
> Section 1.6, exceed 3,706,564 shares.
>
>  
>
> 3. In the event Parent at any time or from time to time between the
> date of this Agreement and the Effective Time declares or pays any dividend
> on Parent Common Stock payable in Parent Common Stock or in any right to
> acquire Parent Common Stock, or effects a subdivision of the outstanding
> shares of Parent Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Parent
> Common Stock (by stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
> and the like), or in the event the outstanding shares of Parent Common
> Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise,
> into a lesser number of shares of Parent Common Stock, then the Applicable
> Fraction shall be appropriately adjusted.
>
>  
>
> 4. If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
> to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
> risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
> purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of
> Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common
> Stock will also be unvested and/or subject to the same repurchase
> option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates
> representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked
> with appropriate legends.
>
>  
>
> 5. A portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger
> shall be delivered into escrow and held as specified in Section 1.8 hereof.
>
>   
>
> 1.6 Employee Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each stock option that
> is then outstanding under the Company\'s 1998 Stock Plan, whether vested or
> unvested (a "Company Option"), shall be assumed by Parent in accordance
> with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the
> Company\'s 1998 Stock Plan and the stock option agreement by which such
> Company Option is evidenced and the Company\'s repurchase right with
> respect to any unvested shares acquired by the exercise of Company Options
> shall be assigned to Parent. All rights with respect to Company Common
> Stock under outstanding Company Options shall thereupon be converted into
> rights with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the
> Effective Time, (a) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised
> solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (b) the number of shares of
> Parent Common Stock subject to each such assumed Company Option shall be
> equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to
> such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
> the Applicable Fraction, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
> of Parent Common Stock, (c) the per share exercise price for the Parent
> Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such assumed Company
> Option shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
> Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect
> immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Applicable Fraction, and
> rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent, and (d)
> each assumed Company Option designated an "incentive stock option" as
> defined in Section 422 of the Code ("ISO") immediately prior to the
> Effective Time shall remain an ISO; and (e) all restrictions on the
> exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall continue in full force
> and effect, and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other
> provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged;
> provided, however, that each such assumed Company Option shall,
> in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as
> appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
> dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction effected by Parent
> after the Effective Time. The Company and Parent shall take all action that
> may be necessary (under the Company\'s 1998 Stock Plan and otherwise) to
> effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6. Each holder of a Company
> Option will receive credit for time served as an employee of the Company
> for the purposes of the vesting schedule of such Company Option assumed by
> the Parent. Following the Closing, Parent will send to each holder of an
> assumed Company Option a written notice setting forth (i) the number of
> shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Option, and
> (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock issuable
> upon exercise of such assumed Company Option. As soon as reasonably
> practicable, and in any event within 60 days after the Closing Date, unless
> such 60 day period is impracticable, Parent shall file with the SEC, a
> registration statement on Form S-8 registering the shares of Parent Common
> Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company Options assumed by Parent
> pursuant to this Section 1.6.
>
>   
>
> 1.7 Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books. At the Effective Time,
> holders of certificates representing shares of the Company\'s capital stock
> that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
> to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock transfer
> books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such
> capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
> further transfer of any such shares of the Company\'s capital stock shall
> be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after
> the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any of such
> shares of the Company\'s capital stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is
> presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
> Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section
> 1.8.
>
>   
>
> 1.8 Exchange of Certificates; Escrow Shares.
>
>    
>
> 1. (i) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a
> reputable bank or trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the
> "Exchange Agent"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
> with the Exchange Agent (1) certificates representing the shares of Parent
> Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1, and (2) cash sufficient
> to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
> 1.5(c). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited
> with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions
> received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are referred to
> collectively as the "Exchange Fund."
>
>  
>
> (ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
> Exchange Agent will mail to the Merger Stockholders (x) a letter of
> transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
> reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of
> Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
> Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company
> Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (y) instructions for use in
> effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange
> for certificates representing Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a
> Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with
> a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
> reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (1) the Merger
> Stockholder holding such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
> receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing 90% of the number
> of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such Merger Stockholder has the
> right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in
> lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (2) the Company
> Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. The Exchange Agent
> shall thereupon also deliver to the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement
> in the form of Exhibit H hereto (the "Escrow Agreement") a certificate
> representing 10% of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that
> such Merger Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions
> of Section 1.5. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each
> Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
> Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
> (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as
> contemplated by Section 1. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been
> lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
> precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common
> Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
> Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in
> such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim
> that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
> Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.
>
>  
>
> 2. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
> Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
> paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate
> with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and
> no cash payment in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to any such
> holder, until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in
> accordance with this Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be
> entitled to receive all such dividends and distributions and such cash
> payment).
>
>  
>
> 3. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
> connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such fractional
> shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any holder of
> capital stock of the Company who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
> fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
> fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall,
> upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid in
> cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent),
> without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the average of
> the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on
> the Nasdaq National Market for each of the five consecutive trading days
> ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing (the "Average
> Parent Common Stock Price").
>
>  
>
> 4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
> Agreement, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates
> therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Company Stock Certificate to
> any Person who may be an "affiliate" (as that term is used in Rule 145
> under the Securities Act) of the Company until such Person shall have
> delivered to Parent and the Company a duly executed Affiliate Agreement as
> contemplated by Section 5.9.
>
>  
>
> 5. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
> holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the
> date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent
> upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have
> not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance
> with this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction
> of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares
> of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to
> Parent Common Stock.
>
>  
>
> 6. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
> shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
> otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of capital stock of
> the Company pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the
> Surviving Corporation is required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the
> Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
> extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
> treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
> the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
>
>  
>
> 7. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
> holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company for any shares of
> Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto),
> or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any
> applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
>
>   
>
> 1.9 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
> in this Agreement, any shares ("Dissenting Shares") of Company Common Stock
> that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
> either (a) are or may become "dissenting shares" within the meaning of
> Section 1300(b) of the CGCL or (b) held by any Person who is entitled to
> demand and properly demands payment of the fair value of such
> Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
> Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into or be
> exchangeable for the right to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance
> with Section 1.5 (or cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
> Section 1.5), but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
> only to either (x) payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
> accordance with Section 262 or (y) such rights as may be granted to such
> holder or holders in Chapter 13 of the CGCL; _provided, however_ , that if
> any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
> lose the right to receive payment of the fair value of such holder\'s
> Dissenting Shares under Section 262 or Chapter 13 of the CGCL, as
> applicable, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
> holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
> deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
> become exchangeable solely for the right to receive Parent Common Stock in
> accordance with Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares in
> accordance with Section 1.8(c)). The Company shall give prompt notice to
> Parent and Merger Sub of any demands received by the Company for payment of
> fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock (including a copy of each
> demand), and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in
> and direct, at Parent\'s expense, all negotiations and proceedings with
> respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
> not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
> respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or agree to
> do any of the foregoing. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
> be responsible for all payments with respect to Dissenting Shares,
> including without limitation, all expense associated with negotiations and
> proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal required under DGCL or
> the CGCL.
>
>   
>
> 1.10 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
> intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368
> of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a
> "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
> 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.
>
>   
>
> 1.11 Accounting Treatment. For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended
> to be treated as a "pooling of interests."
>
>   
>
> 1.12 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
> action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out
> the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or
> Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
> property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
> Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
> Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

> connection with such inaccuracy or breach.
>
>  
>
> 4. Deductible. The Indemnitors shall not be required to make any
> indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a) until such time as the
> total amount of all Damages (including the Damages arising from
> any inaccuracies in or breaches of any representations or warranties) that
> have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of
> the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Indemnitees has or
> have otherwise become subject, exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate. (If the
> total amount of such Damages exceeds $500,000, then the Indemnitees shall
> be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed only
> for the portion of such Damages exceeding $500,000.)
>
>   
>
> 5. Maximum Liability.
>
>    
>
> 1. Subject to Section 9.2(e)(ii), Parent\'s recourse for all claims
> for Damages under clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 9.2(a) shall be limited to
> the Escrow Shares except with respect to any representation or warranty set
> forth in Section 2.3, 2.4, 2.9, 2.10, 2.14 or 2.19 (each a "Specified
> Representation").
>
>  
>
> 2. The maximum liability (including under Section 9.2(e)(i)) of each
> Indemnitor to the Indemnitees for Damages relating to all breaches by the
> Company of Specified Representations, covenants or other
> provisions contained in this Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal
> to the product of (x) such Indemnitor\'s Pro Rata Allocation, (y) 926,641
> and (z) the Average Parent Common Stock Price. Such amount shall include,
> and shall not be in addition to, the value of the Escrow Shares (based on
> the Average Parent Common Stock Price). Parent shall have recourse against
> the Indemnitors under this Section 9 to shares of Parent Common Stock other
> than the Escrow Shares for Damages relating to all breaches by the Company
> of Specified Representations, covenants or other provisions contained in
> this Agreement only in the event that the Escrow Shares have been
> exhausted; _provided, however_ , that, subject to the first sentence of
> this Section 9.2(e)(ii), if Escrow Shares have been returned to Parent in
> connection with Damages resulting from breaches of Specified
> Representations, covenants or other provisions contained in this Agreement
> and there are insufficient remaining Escrow Shares to satisfy in full any
> claims for Damages under clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 9.2(a),
> Parent shall have recourse against the Indemnitors in connection with any
> Damages under clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 9.2(a) for a number of shares
> of Parent Common Stock other than the Escrow Shares equal to the number of
> Escrow Shares that have been returned to Parent in connection with Damages
> resulting from breaches of Specified Representations, covenants or other
> provisions contained in this Agreement. (By way of example: if Escrow
> Shares are returned to Parent in satisfaction of claims in connection with
> breaches of Specified Representations and there are insufficient remaining
> Escrow Shares to cover subsequent claims for breaches of representations or
> warranties that are not Specified Representations, Parent shall have
> recourse directly from the Indemnitors to shares of Parent Common Stock in
> an amount equal to the number of Escrow Shares that had been returned to
> Parent in connection with breaches of Specified Representations, provided
> that the Indemnitors\' maximum liability shall be limited as set forth in
> the first sentence of this Section 9.2(e)(ii).)
>
>   
>
> 6. Exclusions from Limitations. The limitations that are set forth in
> Sections 9.2(d) and 9.2(e) shall not apply in the case of fraud or
> intentional misrepresentation; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall
> any Indemnitor\'s liability exceed the amount equal to the result of
> the multiplication of the Average Parent Common Stock Price by the number
> of shares of Parent Common Stock received by such Indemnitor in the Merger.
>
>   
>
> 9.3 No Contribution. Each Indemnitor waives, and acknowledges and agrees
> that he shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to
> exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
> right or remedy against Merger Sub or any of the Acquired Corporations in
> connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to
> which he may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or
> the Company Closing Certificate.
>
>   
>
> 9.4 Interest. Any Indemnitor who is required to hold harmless, indemnify,
> compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9 with
> respect to any Damages shall also be liable to such Indemnitee for interest
> on the amount of such Damages (for the period commencing as of the date on
> which such Indemnitor first received notice of a claim for recovery by such
> Indemnitee and ending on the date on which the liability of such Indemnitor
> to such Indemnitee is fully satisfied by such Indemnitor) at a floating
> rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Bank of America,
> N.T. and S.A. from time to time as its prime, base or reference rate. Such
> interest shall be deemed to be "Damages" for purposes of this Section 9.
>
>   
>
> 9.5 Mitigation of Loss. Indemnitees shall use their reasonable efforts to
> mitigate any Damages in connection with an indemnity claim made pursuant to
> Section 9.2(a) with the scope to be as required by applicable law. If the
> amount of Damages, at any time prior to or subsequent to the
> payment thereof by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee pursuant to this Section
> 9 is reduced pursuant to any insurance coverage, the amount of such
> reduction (net of (i) any out-of-pocket expenses, (ii) increases in
> premiums or (iii) any deductible incurred in obtaining such reduction)
> shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor.
> Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement including this
> Section 9.5, there shall be no affirmative obligation or duty on the part
> of either Parent or Merger Sub to obtain insurance with respect to any
> aspect of their respective business, operations or assets.
>
>   
>
> 9.6 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
> commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether
> against Merger Sub or any of the Acquired Corporations, against Parent or
> against any other Person) with respect to which any Indemnitor may become
> obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any
> Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9, Parent shall have the right, at its
> election, to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on
> its own with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Stockholders\' Agent.
> If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal
> Proceeding:
>
>    
>
> 1. all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim or
> Legal Proceeding shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnitors;
>
>  
>
> 2. each Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any documents and
> materials in his possession or control that may be necessary to the defense
> of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and
>
>  
>
> 3. Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such
> claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of the Stockholders\' Agent (as
> defined in Section 10.1); provided, however, that such consent shall not be
> unreasonably withheld.
>
>   
>
> Parent shall give the Stockholders\' Agent prompt notice of the
> commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or
> any of the Acquired Corporations and shall keep the Stockholders\' Agent
> informed at all stages thereof; provided, however, that any failure on the
> part of Parent to so notify or inform the Stockholders\' Agent shall not
> limit any of the obligations of the Indemnitors under this Section 9
> (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of
> such Legal Proceeding). If Parent does not elect to proceed with the
> defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Stockholders\' Agent may
> proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel
> reasonably satisfactory to Parent; _provided, however,_ that the
> Stockholders\' Agent may not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or
> Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
> may not be unreasonably withheld).
>
>   
>
> 9.7 Setoff. In addition to any rights of setoff or other similar rights
> that Parent or any of the other Indemnitees may have at common law or
> otherwise, Parent shall have the right to withhold and deduct any sum that
> may be owed to any Indemnitee under this Section 9 or pursuant to any other
> provision of this Agreement from any amount otherwise payable by any
> Indemnitee to the Stockholders\' Agent or any stockholder of the Company;
> _provided, however_ , that any such right of Parent shall be subject to the
> limitations set forth in Section 9.2(e) and _provided further_ that Parent
> shall not be entitled to set off against Parent Shares held by Parent under
> any affiliate agreement in excess of an Indemnitor\'s Pro Rata Allocation
> of any Damages pursuant to this Section 9.
>
>   
>
> 9.8 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to the rights of the Indemnitees set forth
> in Section 9.7, the Indemnitors shall not be liable or responsible in any
> manner whatsoever to Indemnitees, whether for indemnification or otherwise,
> except for indemnity as expressly provided in this Section 9 and this
> Section 9 provides the exclusive remedy and cause of action of
> Indemnitees against any Indemnitor with respect to any matter arising out
> of or in connection with this Agreement; provided, however, no claim
> against an Indemnitor for fraud or intentional misrepresentation by such
> Indemnitor shall be subject to the limitations of this paragraph or this
> Section 9, other than as set forth in the proviso set forth in Section
> 9.2(f).
>
>   
>
> 9.9 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent. No Indemnitee
> (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be
> permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy
> under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign
> thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification
> claim or the exercise of such other remedy.
>
>
