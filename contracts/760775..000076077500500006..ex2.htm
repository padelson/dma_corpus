 **ARTICLE I**

  

 _ **THE MERGER**_

  

  SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Virginia Law, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Acquiror Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Acquiror Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Pilgrims Pride Corporation of Virginia, Inc. 

  

  SECTION 1.02. _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable and in no event later than the twentieth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (or such other date as may be agreed in writing by each of the parties hereto), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the " _Corporation Commission_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, Virginia Law. The term " _Effective Time_ " means the date and time of the approval of the Articles of Merger by the Corporation Commission (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by each of the parties hereto and specified in the Articles of Merger). Immediately prior to the filing of the Articles of Merger, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") will be held at the offices of Baker and McKenzie in Dallas, Texas (or such other place and time as the parties may agree). 

  

  SECTION 1.03. _Effect of the Merger_. The effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Virginia Law. 

  

  SECTION 1.04. _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_. (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended as of the Effective Time by operation of this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger without any further action by the shareholders or directors of the Surviving Corporation to read the same in its entirety the Articles of Incorporation of Acquiror Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that Article 1 thereof shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows: "1\. The name of the corporation is Pilgrims Pride Corporation of Virginia, Inc."

  

  (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Acquiror Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws. 

  

  SECTION 1.05. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Acquiror Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until a successor is elected or appointed and has qualified or until the earliest of such directors death, resignation, removal or disqualification, and the officers of the Company (other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Acquiror Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or as otherwise provided in the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 **ARTICLE II**

  

 _ **CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**_  

  

  SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following shares of capital stock: 
 

  

  (a) Each share of Class A Common Stock, no par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "; shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount equal to $14.25 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.03, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share, less any required withholding taxes; 
 

  

  (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Acquiror Sub, Acquiror or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror or of the _Company_ immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and 
 

  

  (c) Each share of Common Stock of Acquiror Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 
 

  

  SECTION 2.02. _Employee Stock Options; Warrants_. (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under Companys 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan and 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, whether or not then exercisable, shall be canceled by the Company, and each holder of a canceled Company Option shall be entitled to receive no later than the later of (x) the Effective Time and (y) 10 days after the receipt of a release and waiver from such holder as described in the final sentence of this subsection (a), from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for the cancellation of such Company Option, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option, less any required withholding taxes. The Company shall obtain from each person named in Section 2.02 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and shall use its best efforts to obtain from each other holder of a Company Option, a release and waiver effective as of the Effective Time of each such persons rights under the terms of any Company Option. 

  

  (b) At the Effective Time, pursuant to the terms of each outstanding warrant granted to First Union National Bank and Harris Trust and Savings Bank (a " _Company Warrant_ "), each holder of a Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive promptly upon exercise thereof subsequent to the Closing from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares previously subject to such Company Warrant and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Warrant, less any required withholding taxes.

  

  SECTION 2.03. _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror Sub shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a). At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to have sufficient funds to deposit, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit in trust with the Paying Agent, cash in the aggregate amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub) and (ii) the Merger Consideration. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation, _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $100 million (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or otherwise); _provided, however_ , that no loss on any investment made pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall relieve Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation of its obligation to pay the Merger Consideration for each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding taxes, the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. If a mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Paying Agent or the holder of a Certificate submits an affidavit to the Paying Agent stating that the Certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, then such holder shall, if required by the Surviving Corporation, furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the reasonable judgment of the Surviving Corporation to protect Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent from any loss that any of them may suffer. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the distribution of the Merger Consideration.

  

  (c) At any time following the sixth month after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration properly delivered in respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

  

  (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and, thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. 
 

  

 **ARTICLE III**

  

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

  

  Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company and signed by the Company and Acquiror for identification prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), which shall be numbered in such a way as to correspond with the section references below and the disclosure made shall relate only to the representations and warranties made within the relevant section, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub that: 

  

  SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power; Subsidiaries_. The Company is a corporation, and each subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") is a corporation or partnership, in each case duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite corporate or partnership power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company and each Company Subsidiary are duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or partnership to do business, and are in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by them or the nature of their business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means with respect to any person, any change or effect that, individually or when taken together with all such other changes or effects, is materially adverse to the condition (financial or other), business, operations, properties, assets, liabilities or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. A true and correct list of all Company Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of organization of each Company Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of each Company Subsidiary owned by the Company and each other Company Subsidiary, is set forth in Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as disclosed in Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity. 

  

  SECTION 3.02. _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company has heretofore furnished to Acquiror a complete and correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of any provision of its Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents. 

  

  SECTION 3.03. _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 100,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, no par value (" _Company Class B Common Stock_ "), and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of September 26, 2000, (a) 16,203,403 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights, (b) 700,750 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable pursuant to outstanding Company Options and (c) 320,364 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable pursuant to outstanding Company Warrants. The number of Company Options and Company Warrants, and the exercise prices thereof, as of September 26, 2000, are set forth in Section 3.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. No shares of Company Class B Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 3.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (including, without limitation, stock appreciation rights) relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or pay any amounts of money as a result thereof. Between September 26, 2000 and the date of this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock have been issued by the Company, except shares issued pursuant to the Company Plans (as defined below) and shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the Company Options and Company Warrants, in each case in accordance with their respective terms as in effect on the date hereof, and no Company Options have been granted.

  SECTION 3.09. _Absence of Litigation_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.09(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (" _Claim_ ") pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, by, on behalf of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority which (a) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or (b) seeks to and is reasonably likely to significantly delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger.

No Plan is or has been covered by Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Plan is being audited or investigated by any government agency or subject to any pending or threatened Claim. Neither the Company nor any fiduciary of any Plan has engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

Each Material Contract is in full force and effect and is enforceable against the parties thereto (other than the Company) in accordance with its terms and no condition or state of facts exists that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute a material default by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any third party under such Material Contracts.

The Company is not indebted or otherwise obligated to any such person described above, except for amounts due under normal arrangements applicable to all employees generally as to salary or reimbursement of ordinary business expenses not unusual in amount or significance. As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments which would entitle any director, officer or employee (or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to indemnification by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation (or similar instrument) or bylaws (or similar instrument) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any insurance policy maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

The Company has previously provided to Acquiror a schedule of each of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries long-term pricing commitments for the Major Customers for the fiscal year ending July 1, 2000, and no material reduction in any such commitment has occurred subsequent to July 1, 2000.

The Company agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party.

  (c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.05 shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with respect to any tender or exchange offer; provided, however, that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof, shall, except as permitted by Section 6.05(b), withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its approval or recommendation with respect to this Agreement or the Merger (including, without limitation, any resolution providing for such approval), or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal. 

  

  SECTION 6.06. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

  (b) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), claims, damages, liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement of, with the approval of the Surviving Corporation (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), or otherwise in connection with, any threatened or actual Claim, based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that the Indemnified Party (or the Person controlled by the Indemnified Party) is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and pertaining to any matter existing or arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any Claim arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under Law, and shall pay any expenses, as incurred, in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under Law. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Claim is brought against any of the Indemnified Parties, (i) such Indemnified Parties may retain counsel (including local counsel) satisfactory to them and which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and Acquiror shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Parties; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any such Claim, provided that Acquiror shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent, which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Parties as a group shall retain only one law firm (plus appropriate local counsel) to represent them with respect to each such Claim unless there is, as determined by counsel to the Indemnified Parties, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict or a reasonable likelihood of a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties at the expense of Acquiror. 

  

  (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause to be maintained in effect the Companys current policy of Directors and Officers Liability Insurance (provided that Acquiror may substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous in any material respect) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred before the Effective Time to the extent available at an annual premium not in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof.

  SECTION 6.11. _Further Action_.

As soon as possible after receipt of any such notice from Acquiror identifying any Phase II Assessments to be obtained, but in no event later than ten business days after receipt of such notice, the Company shall deliver to Acquiror a Phase II environmental assessment audit conducted after September 1, 2000 by Nova Consulting Group, Inc. or Patton, Harris, Rust and Associates in accordance with all applicable American Society for Testing and Materials standards (including ASTM E1903-97 Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Process) (a " _Phase II Assessment_ "), to the extent recommended or otherwise suggested by any of the Phase I Assessments referred to above in this Section 6.17 and not waived by Acquiror. Acquiror shall notify the Company in writing of its determination, no later than five business days after receipt of all such Phase II Assessments, as to whether the closing condition in Section 7.02(f) is satisfied. All such Phase I and Phase II Assessments shall be performed for the mutual benefit of Acquiror and the Company.

 **ARTICLE FIVE 
  _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION_**

  

 Section One. Limitation or Elimination of Liability. To the full extent that the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, as it exists on the date hereof or may hereafter be amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors or officers, a director or officer of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for any monetary damages in excess of one dollar.

  

 Section Two. Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify a director or officer of the Corporation who is or was a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was such a director or officer or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against all liabilities and expenses incurred in the proceeding except such liabilities and expenses as are incurred because of his willful misconduct or knowing violation of the criminal law.

  

 Section 3. Determination to Indemnify. Subject to the provisions of Section 7 of this Article, a determination to indemnify a director or officer under Section 2 of this Article shall be made, in the first instance, by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors, such quorum consisting of disinterested directors. If a quorum of disinterested directors cannot be obtained, then the determination shall be made by a majority vote of a committee designated by the Board of Directors (in which designation interested directors may participate), the committee to consist solely of two or more disinterested directors. If such a committee cannot be designated, the determination shall be made by special legal counsel selected by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of disinterested directors, or, if the same cannot be obtained, by the committee described above. If neither a quorum consisting of disinterested directors or the committee described above can be obtained, the selection of special legal counsel shall be made by majority vote of the Board of Directors (in which selection interested directors may participate). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Article, in any instance, the determination to indemnify a director or officer may be made by vote of the shareholders, except that any shares owned, or voted under the control of, directors or officers who are parties to the proceeding may not be voted.

  

 Section 4. Advances and Reimbursements of Expenses. Once a determination to indemnify has been made pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of this Article, the Corporation shall make advances for expenses of, and reimbursements for expenses incurred by, any director or officer in any proceeding described in Section 2 of this Article, upon receipt of an undertaking from the director or officer to repay the same if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled to indemnification. Such undertaking shall be an unlimited, unsecured general obligation of the director or officer and shall be accepted without reference to his ability to make repayment. The director or officer also shall furnish the Corporation with a written statement of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct described in Va. Code 13.1-697, as amended.

  

 Section 5. Indemnification of Agents and Employees. The Board of Directors may cause the Corporation to indemnify and make advances and reimbursements to any person not specified in Section 2 of this Article who was or is a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom indemnification is granted in Section 2. The provisions of Section 2 through 4 of this Article shall be applicable to any indemnification, determination, advancements and reimbursements provided pursuant to this Section.

  

 Section 6. Indemnification Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify it against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it in accordance with this Article, and also may procure insurance in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against liability asserted against or incurred by any such person in any such capacity or arising from his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article.

  

 Section 7. Changes in the Board Composition. In the event there has been a change in the composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification is claimed, any determination as to indemnification, advancement or reimbursement of expenses with respect to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to Sections 2 or 5 of this Article shall be made by special legal counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee. If the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel, the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee each shall select a nominee, and the nominee shall select such special legal counsel.

  

 Section 8. Applicability of this Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to all actions, claims, suits or proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from any action taken or failure to act before or after such adoption. No amendment, modification or repeal of this Article shall diminish the rights provided hereby or diminish the right to indemnification with respect to any claim, issue or matter in any then pending or subsequent proceeding that is based in any material respect on any alleged action or failure to act prior to such amendment, modification or appeal. Reference herein to directors, officers, employees or agents shall include former directors, officers, employees and agents and their respective heirs, executors and administrators. 

  

 **ARTICLE SIX 
  _AMENDMENTS_ **

  

 Where a shareholder vote is required by Virginia law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall be amended by approval of the holders of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast provided such amendment has been recommended for approval to the shareholders of the Corporation by a majority of the Board of Directors. Where no shareholder vote is required by Virginia law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall be amended by a vote of the Corporations Board of Directors without shareholder action.
