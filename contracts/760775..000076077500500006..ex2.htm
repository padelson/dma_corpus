guaranteed by the United States of America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated

financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the &#147;<u>SEC</u>&#148;) or otherwise); <u>provided, however</u>,
that no loss on any investment made pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall relieve Acquiror
or the Surviving Corporation of its obligation to pay the Merger Consideration for each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promptly after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a)
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the &#147;<u>Certificates</u>&#148;)
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such
letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to any required withholding taxes, the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled.
No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment
shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. If a mutilated Certificate is
surrendered to the Paying Agent or the holder of a Certificate submits an affidavit to the
Paying Agent stating that the Certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken,
then such holder shall, if required by the Surviving Corporation, furnish an indemnity
bond sufficient in the reasonable judgment of the Surviving Corporation to protect
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent from any loss that any of them
may suffer. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those
of the Paying Agent, in connection with the distribution of the Merger Consideration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any time following the sixth month after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to
holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and other income received
by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) and, thereafter, such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect
to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates
held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration
properly delivered in respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and, thereafter, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable law.<br>

<p align="center"><strong><u>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY</u></strong> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company and signed by the
Company and Acquiror for identification prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the &#147;<u>Company Disclosure Schedule</u>&#148;), which shall be numbered in
such a way as to correspond with the section references below and the disclosure made
shall relate only to the representations and warranties made within the relevant section,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub that: </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.01.&nbsp; <u>Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power; Subsidiaries</u>.
The Company is a corporation, and each subsidiary of the Company (a &#147;<u>Company
Subsidiary</u>&#148;) is a corporation or partnership, in each case duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite corporate or partnership power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Company and each Company Subsidiary are duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation or partnership to do business, and are in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by them or
the nature of their business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this
Agreement, the term &#147;<u>Material Adverse Effect</u>&#148; means with respect to any
person, any change or effect that, individually or when taken together with all such other
changes or effects, is materially adverse to the condition (financial or other), business,
operations, properties, assets, liabilities or results of operations of such person and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
A true and correct list of all Company Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of
organization of each Company Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding capital
stock or other equity interests of each Company Subsidiary owned by the Company and each
other Company Subsidiary, is set forth in Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Except as disclosed in Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does
not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.02.&nbsp; <u>Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws</u>. The Company has
heretofore furnished to Acquiror a complete and correct copy of the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended to date,
of the Company and each Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is in violation of any provision of its Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.03.&nbsp; <u>Capitalization</u>. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 100,000,000 shares of Class B
Common Stock, no par value (&#147;<u>Company Class B Common Stock</u>&#148;), and
50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value (&#147;<u>Company Preferred Stock</u>&#148;).
As of September 26, 2000, (a) 16,203,403 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to preemptive rights, (b) 700,750 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable pursuant to
outstanding Company Options and (c) 320,364 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable
pursuant to outstanding Company Warrants. The number of Company Options and Company
Warrants, and the exercise prices thereof, as of September 26, 2000, are set forth in
Section 3.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. No shares of Company Class B Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 3.03
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (including, without limitation,
stock appreciation rights) relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary obligating the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or pay any amounts of money as a
result thereof. Between September 26, 2000 and the date of this Agreement, no shares of
Company Common Stock have been issued by the Company, except shares issued pursuant to the
Company Plans (as defined below) and shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the Company
Options and Company Warrants, in each case in accordance with their respective terms as in
effect on the date hereof, and no Company Options have been granted. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or any capital
stock of, or any equity interest in, any Company Subsidiary. No shareholder of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary will have any dissenter&#146;s rights, rights of appraisal or
similar rights under Virginia Law in connection with the Merger or the Transactions.
Except as described in Section 3.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each outstanding
share of capital stock of, or other equity interest in, each Company Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company&#146;s Poultry
Producer Stock Purchase Plan, Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and Plan to Issue Stock for Director Compensation
(collectively, the &#147;<u>Company Plans</u>&#148;) have been suspended, and no stock
will be issued under any such plan except as reflected in this Section 3.03. As of the
Effective Time, the sum of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
plus the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock then issuable (assuming
acceleration of any vesting provisions) upon the exercise of Company Options and Company
Warrants, shall not exceed 17,155,317, and no shares of Company Common Stock will be
issuable pursuant to any of the Company Plans. The maximum amount payable by the Company
pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 2.02 is $239,628,752. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.04.&nbsp; <u>Authority Relative to This Agreement</u>. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, with
respect to the Merger, upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by
the Company&#146;s shareholders in accordance with this Agreement and Virginia Law, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the holders of two thirds of the
then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and the filing and recordation of
appropriate Articles of Merger with the Corporation Commission as required by Virginia
Law). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.05.&nbsp; <u>No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents</u>. (a) The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this
Agreement by the Company will not, nor will the transfer of any assets by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, subject to (x) with respect to the Merger, obtaining the requisite
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company&#146;s shareholders
in accordance with this Agreement and Virginia Law, and (y) obtaining the consents,
approvals, authorizations and permits and making the filings described in Section 3.05(b)
and Section 3.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) conflict with or violate the
Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate any domestic (federal, state or
local) or foreign law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (collectively, &#147;<u>Laws</u>&#148;)
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii) except as specified
in Section 3.05(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a default) under, or give to others any right of termination, unilateral amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance
on any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or result in the
payment of any amounts as a result of such transactions, or require the consent of any
third party pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,
license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except
for such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, liens and consents which could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign, except (i) pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;<u>Exchange Act</u>&#148;), state
securities or &#147;blue sky&#148; laws (&#147;<u>Blue Sky Laws</u>&#148;), the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#147;<u>HSR Act</u>&#148;)
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and filing and recordation of
appropriate Articles of Merger with the Corporation Commission as required by Virginia
Law, (ii) as specified in Section 3.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii)
where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make
such filings or notifications, could not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger, or
otherwise prevent the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.06.&nbsp; <u>Permits; Compliance</u>. Except as disclosed in Section 3.06 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any United States
(federal, state or local) or foreign government, or governmental, regulatory or
administrative authority, agency or commission or court of competent jurisdiction (&#147;<u>Governmental
Authority</u>&#148;) necessary for the Company or any Company Subsidiary to own, lease and
operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
for those which the failure to possess could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company (the &#147;<u>Company Permits</u>&#148;), and no suspension
or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened. Except as disclosed in Section 3.06 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and each Company Subsidiary are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and Company Permits. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.07.&nbsp; <u>SEC Filings; Financial Statements</u>. (a) Except as set forth in
Section 3.07(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has timely filed all
forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since July 1, 1995
(collectively, the &#147;<u>Company SEC Reports</u>&#148;). The Company SEC Reports (i)
were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;<u>Securities Act</u>&#148;), and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did
not, at the time they were filed (or at the effective date thereof in the case of
registration statements), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. No Company Subsidiary is currently required to file any form, report or other
document with the SEC. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has delivered to Acquiror true and correct copies
of its audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2000 (the
&#147;<u>Most Recent Financial Statements</u>&#148;). Each of the Most Recent Financial
Statements and the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto)
contained in the Company SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis (&#147;<u>GAAP</u>&#148;)
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
except that financial statements included with interim reports do not contain all GAAP
notes to such financial statements) and each fairly presented in all material respects the
financial position, results of operations and changes in shareholders&#146; equity and
cash flows of the Company as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not and could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except (i) to the extent set forth on the balance sheet as of
July 1, 2000 included in the Most Recent Financial Statements (the &#147;<u>Most Recent
Balance Sheet</u>&#148;) of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries, or (ii)
as set forth in Section 3.07(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) which would be required to be reflected on a balance
sheet, or in the notes thereto, prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities
and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since July 1, 2000, which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material in
amount. As of September 25, 2000, the aggregate amount of indebtedness for borrowed money
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is $53,387,749. Other than for working capital
borrowed in the ordinary course of business in accordance with past practice, no
additional indebtedness for borrowed money has been incurred between September 25, 2000
and the date hereof. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has heretofore furnished to Acquiror complete and
correct copies of all amendments and modifications (if any) that have not been filed by
the Company with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other instruments that
previously had been filed by the Company as exhibits to the Company SEC Reports and are
currently in effect. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The receivables of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
either reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet or created subsequent to July 1, 2000
are, to the extent not previously collected in full, true and valid receivables, created
in the ordinary course of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Since
July 1, 2000, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has (i) permitted or agreed
to any extension in the time for payment of receivables other than in the ordinary course
of business and consistent with past practice or (ii) changed its collection practices
with respect to the receivables, including, without limitation, granted discounts in
return for the early collection thereof other than in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.08.&nbsp; <u>Absence of Certain Changes or Events</u>. Since July 1, 2000,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.08 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
conducted their business only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice and, since July 1, 2000, there has not been (a) any event or events (whether or
not covered by insurance) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, (b) any material change by the Company in its accounting methods,
principles or practices, (c) any entry by the Company or any Company Subsidiary into any
commitment or transaction material to the Company, except in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice, (d) any declaration, setting aside or payment
of any dividend or distribution in respect of any capital stock or equity interests of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition of
any of the Company&#146;s or the Company Subsidiaries&#146; securities, (e) any increase
in, amendment to or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option, stock purchase or other
employee benefit plan, (f) any general increase in compensation, bonus, severance or
termination pay or other benefits payable to the employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or, except for increases in the ordinary course of business in connection
with periodic reviews and in amounts consistent with past practice, any specific increase
in the compensation, bonus or other benefits payable to such employees, (g) any payment by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary of a bonus to any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (h) any operation of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice; (i) any
incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money or assumption or guarantee of indebtedness
for borrowed money by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than loans from the
Company to any wholly owned Company Subsidiary or from any wholly owned Company Subsidiary
to the Company or any other wholly owned Company Subsidiary), or the grant of any lien on
the assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to secure indebtedness for borrowed
money, (j) any sale or transfer of any assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, or (k)
any loan, advance or capital contribution to or investment in any person in an aggregate
amount in excess of $100,000 by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (excluding any loan,
advance or capital contribution to, or investment in, the Company or any wholly owned
Company Subsidiary). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.09.&nbsp; <u>Absence of Litigation</u>. Except as disclosed in Section 3.09(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (&#147;<u>Claim</u>&#148;) pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, by, on behalf of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority which (a) could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or (b) seeks to and is reasonably likely to
significantly delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger. Except as disclosed in
Section 3.09(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no Claim pending or, to the
best knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
by, on behalf of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority. The Most Recent
Balance Sheet included reasonable loss reserves with respect to each Claim disclosed in
Section 3.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Neither the Company or any Company
Subsidiary nor any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject
to or in violation of any order, executive order, writ, stay, decree, judgment,
determination, award or injunction (each an &#147;<u>Order</u>&#148;) that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SECTION 3.10.&nbsp; <u>Employee Benefit Plans; Agreements</u>. (a) Section 3.10 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists all plans, programs and arrangements providing benefits
and maintained for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, whether or not such plan, program or arrangement is
subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#147;<u>ERISA</u>&#148;)
(the &#147;<u>Plans</u>&#148;). The Company has given or made available to Acquiror a true
and complete copy of each Plan document, each material document prepared in connection
with each Plan, including any applicable trust agreement, insurance contract or other
funding medium, all amendments with respect to such Plan documents, the most recent
summary plan description, actuarial report, and determination letter issued by the
Internal Revenue Service (&#147;<u>IRS</u>&#148;), Form 5500 with all related schedules
filed for the prior three (3) years in respect of each such Plan subject to the annual
reporting requirements of ERISA, and each Company Employment Contract (as defined herein).
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary presently (nor have they at any time in the
past) maintains, contributes to or has any liability (including current or potential
withdrawal liability) with respect to any multi-employer plan within the meaning of ERISA.
None of the Plans, other than those as described in Section 3.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, promises or provides retiree medical or life insurance benefits to
any person other than continued medical coverage required under the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, the costs for which are borne by the former
employee or beneficiary. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a participating
employer in any Plan to which more than one employer makes contributions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Plan complies, in both form and operation, in all
material respects, with its written terms, and, as applicable with ERISA, the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<u>Code</u>&#148;), and other applicable Law,
and no condition exists or event has occurred with respect to any such Plan which would
result in any material liability, fine or penalty for the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Each Plan is legally valid and binding and in full force and effect. Each Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified and nothing has
occurred since the date of such letter to affect the qualified status of such Plan. The
Company has not incurred any direct or indirect material liability under, arising out of
or by operation of Title IV of ERISA in connection with the termination of, or withdrawal
from, any Plan or other retirement plan or arrangement and, as of the date hereof, no fact
exists or event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
liability. No Plan is or has been covered by Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.
No Plan is being audited or investigated by any government agency or subject to any
pending or threatened Claim. Neither the Company nor any fiduciary of any Plan has engaged
in a non-exempt prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code. No event has occurred with respect to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary could be liable for a tax imposed by any of Sections 4972, 4976, 4977,
4979, 4980 or 4980B of the Code, or for a civil penalty under Section 502(d) of ERISA. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all Laws pertaining to employment practices, including wage and
hour laws, the Americans with Disabilities Act, discrimination laws and the Worker
Adjustment Retraining Notification Act, and, except as disclosed in Section 3.10(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no fact or event exists that could give rise to liability
under such Laws, except for such occurrences, noncompliances and liabilities as could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the name of each officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with an
annual base compensation greater than $75,000, the annual base compensation applicable to
each such officer or employee and a complete and accurate list of each (the items
described in subsections (i) through (iv) below, collectively, the &#147;<u>Company
Employment Contracts</u>&#148;): </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; employment, severance, or collective bargaining agreement not
terminable without liability or obligation on 60 days' or less notice; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement with any director, affiliate, executive officer, or
other key employee (or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing), agent,
or contractor of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, the benefits of which are
contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered, on the occurrence of a
transaction involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary of the Company of the nature
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relating to an actual or
potential change in control of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or providing any
term of employment or other compensation guarantee or extending severance benefits or

controlled by the Indemnified Party) is or was a director or officer of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries and pertaining to any matter existing or arising out of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without

them and which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and Acquiror shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Parties; and (ii) the
Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any
such Claim, provided that Acquiror shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent, which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Indemnified Parties as a group shall retain only one law firm (plus appropriate local
counsel) to represent them with respect to each such Claim unless there is, as determined
by counsel to the Indemnified Parties, under applicable standards of professional conduct,
a conflict or a reasonable likelihood of a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties at the expense of Acquiror. </p>

<u>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</u></strong> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section One. Limitation or
Elimination of Liability. To the full extent that the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, as
it exists on the date hereof or may hereafter be amended, permits the limitation or
elimination of the liability of directors or officers, a director or officer of the
Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for any monetary
damages in excess of one dollar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section Two. Indemnification.
The Corporation shall indemnify a director or officer of the Corporation who is or was a
party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was such a director or officer
or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner,
trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise against all liabilities and expenses incurred in
the proceeding except such liabilities and expenses as are incurred because of his willful
misconduct or knowing violation of the criminal law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3. Determination to
Indemnify. Subject to the provisions of Section 7 of this Article, a determination to
indemnify a director or officer under Section 2 of this Article shall be made, in the
first instance, by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors, such quorum
consisting of disinterested directors. If a quorum of disinterested directors cannot be
obtained, then the determination shall be made by a majority vote of a committee
designated by the Board of Directors (in which designation interested directors may
participate), the committee to consist solely of two or more disinterested directors. If
such a committee cannot be designated, the determination shall be made by special legal
counsel selected by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of disinterested directors, or,
if the same cannot be obtained, by the committee described above. If neither a quorum
consisting of disinterested directors or the committee described above can be obtained,
the selection of special legal counsel shall be made by majority vote of the Board of
Directors (in which selection interested directors may participate). Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Article, in any instance, the determination to indemnify a director
or officer may be made by vote of the shareholders, except that any shares owned, or voted
under the control of, directors or officers who are parties to the proceeding may not be
voted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4. Advances and
Reimbursements of Expenses. Once a determination to indemnify has been made pursuant to
the provisions of Section 3 of this Article, the Corporation shall make advances for
expenses of, and reimbursements for expenses incurred by, any director or officer in any
proceeding described in Section 2 of this Article, upon receipt of an undertaking from the
director or officer to repay the same if it is ultimately determined that he is not
entitled to indemnification. Such undertaking shall be an unlimited, unsecured general
obligation of the director or officer and shall be accepted without reference to his
ability to make repayment. The director or officer also shall furnish the Corporation with
a written statement of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct
described in Va. Code 13.1-697, as amended.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 5. Indemnification of
Agents and Employees. The Board of Directors may cause the Corporation to indemnify and
make advances and reimbursements to any person not specified in Section 2 of this Article
who was or is a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was an
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom indemnification is
granted in Section 2. The provisions of Section 2 through 4 of this Article shall be
applicable to any indemnification, determination, advancements and reimbursements provided
pursuant to this Section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 6. Indemnification
Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify it against the
whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it in accordance with this Article, and
also may procure insurance in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against liability asserted
against or incurred by any such person in any such capacity or arising from his status as
such, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against such
liability under the provisions of this Article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7. Changes in the Board
Composition. In the event there has been a change in the composition of a majority of the
Board of Directors after the date of the alleged act or omission with respect to which
indemnification is claimed, any determination as to indemnification, advancement or
reimbursement of expenses with respect to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to
Sections 2 or 5 of this Article shall be made by special legal counsel agreed upon by the
Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee. If the Board of Directors and the proposed
indemnitee are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel, the Board of Directors and
the proposed indemnitee each shall select a nominee, and the nominee shall select such
special legal counsel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 8. Applicability
of this Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to all actions,
claims, suits or proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from any
action taken or failure to act before or after such adoption. No amendment, modification
or repeal of this Article shall diminish the rights provided hereby or diminish the right
to indemnification with respect to any claim, issue or matter in any then pending or
subsequent proceeding that is based in any material respect on any alleged action or
failure to act prior to such amendment, modification or appeal. Reference herein to
directors, officers, employees or agents shall include former directors, officers,
employees and agents and their respective heirs, executors and administrators. </p>
