---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Each Purchaser acknowledges, represents and warrants, and

solely as a result of its due diligence, investigations, enquiries, advice
and knowledge and relying on its own judgment after such investigation and
enquiries;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | irrespective of whether or not the due diligence was as
full or exhaustive as a Purchaser would have wished, it has nevertheless
independently and without the benefit of any inducement, representations or

circumstance which gives or may give rise to the Sellers Warranty Claim;

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | settled between the Seller and relevant Purchaser;

    | (iii)  |   | referred to a Court of competent jurisdiction by a

       | (a)  |   | the resultant loss to the Purchaser is more than
$500,000; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the total of all Sellers Warranty Claims able to be
made or that have been made is greater than $1,500,000 in which event the
Purchaser may claim the whole amount and not just the excess.  
   

  

     1.4  |   | Maximum Liability for Sellers Warranty Claims  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The Sellers total Liability for loss or damage of any kind

then:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | that Purchaser must as soon as reasonably
practicable give notice of the Claim to the Seller which must contain
reasonable details of the Claim, including an estimate of the amount of the
Loss, if any (or the reasons why an estimate is not appropriate in the
circumstances), arising out of or resulting from the Claim or the facts,
matters or circumstances that may give rise to the Claim;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | subject to the Seller indemnifying the relevant
Purchaser to its reasonable satisfaction from and against any and all Losses,
(including additional Tax) which may therefore be sustained or incurred that
Purchaser must either:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | take such reasonable action (including legal
proceedings or making Claims under any insurance policies) as the Seller may
require to avoid, dispute, resist, defend, appeal, compromise or mitigate the
Claim; or  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   ##### 

  

  

![\(BAKER and MCKENZIE LOGO\)](k27278k2727802.gif) 

   

       | (ii)  |   | offer the Seller the option to assume defence of
the Claim except any Claims under which relief other than monetary damages is
sought (such exception including Claims relating to criminal liability or
injunctive relief); and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | a Purchaser must not settle, make any adjustment
of liability or compromise any Claim, or any matter which gives or may give
rise to a Claim, without the prior consent of the Seller (at its absolute
discretion).  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

The Seller must as soon as reasonably practicable notify the relevant
Purchaser following receipt by the Seller of a notice under 1.6(a) indicating
whether the Seller will exercise the option in clause 1.6(b)(ii). 

  

If the Seller exercises the option in clause 1.6(b)(ii), then: 

   

       | (a)  |   | subject to the Seller indemnifying the relevant
Purchaser in the manner set out in clause 1.6(b), each Purchaser agrees to
co-operate with the Seller and do all things reasonably requested by the
Seller in respect of the Claim;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the Seller agrees, at its own expense, to defend the
Claim; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | subject to clause 1.6(d) the Seller may settle or
compromise the Claim with or without the consent of the relevant Purchaser;
and  
   

   

the Seller agrees to consult with the Purchaser in relation to the conduct of
the Claim and not take or persist in any course of action that might
reasonably be regarded as materially harmful to the goodwill or operation of
the Business.

SCHEDULE 6 

 

 Limitations on liability under Tax Indemnity 

   

     1.  |   | The Seller shall not be liable under the indemnity
contained in clause 12.1 of this Agreement for any Tax Liability or Claim
relating to Tax to the extent that:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | such liability is fully provided for in the
Completion Accounts; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | such liability was discharged (whether by payment or by
the use or set-off of any Relief) on or before Completion; or  
      
    | (c)  |   | such liability arises or is increased or that any
provision or reserve which has been made in the Accounts is insufficient by
reason only of:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | any increase in rates of Tax or variation in the
method of applying or calculating the rate of Tax; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | any change made or announced in law (including the
enactment after the Completion Date of any legislation relating to Tax and
the imposition after the Completion Date of any new Tax); or  
      
    | (iii)  |   | any change in the published practice or procedure of
the relevant Tax Authority,  
   

   

in all cases being an increase or change first announced after the Completion
Date, whether or not that change purports to be effective retrospectively in
whole or in part; or 

  

       | (d)  |   | such liability would not have arisen but for a
change of accounting policy or practice after the Completion Date (except
where such change is necessary so as to ensure compliance with generally
accepted accounting principles) or in the length of any accounting period of
any Purchaser Associate after the Completion Date; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | such liability arises or is increased as a result of
any failure by the Purchaser to comply with any of its obligations under this
Agreement including for the avoidance of doubt the Purchasers obligations to
procure that a Group Company carries out any act or does any thing; or  
      
    | (f)  |   | such liability arises as a result of the sale of an
asset or as a result of any other event (including the expiry of a time
period) that causes the crystallisation of a chargeable or other capital gain
by any Purchaser Associate, at any time after Completion; or  
      
    | (g)  |   | any Relief (other than a Purchasers Relief) is
available, or is for no consideration made available by any Seller Associate,
to a Group Company to set against, reduce or eliminate the Tax Liability (and
any Relief that is so available in relation to more than one Tax Liability to
which this Agreement applies shall be deemed, so far as possible, to be used
in such a way as to reduce to the maximum extent possible the Sellers total
liability hereunder); or  
      
    | (h)  |   | such liability has been satisfied at no expense to the
Purchasers; or  
      
    | (i)  |   | such liability would not have arisen or would have been
reduced or eliminated but for a failure or omission by a Group Company to
make any claim, election, surrender or disclaimer or give any notice or
consent or do any other thing after Completion the making giving or doing of
which was taken into account or assumed in computing the provision for Tax
(including the provision for deferred Tax) in the Accounts; or  
   

   ##### 

  

  

![\(BAKER and MCKENZIE LOGO\)](k27278k2727802.gif) 

   

       | (j)  |   | such liability would not have arisen but for a
cessation, or any change in the nature or conduct, of any trade or business
carried on by a Group Company at Completion, being a cessation or change
occurring on or after Completion or the payment of any unusual or abnormal
dividend by a Group Company after Completion; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (k)  |   | any income, profits or gains to which such liability is
attributable were earned or received by a Group Company or accrued to a Group
Company but were not reflected in the Completion Accounts or to the extent
that the liability arises because the assets of a Group Company are greater
than, or the liabilities are less than, those taken into account in computing
the provision or reserve for Tax in the Completion Accounts provided that
this paragraph (k) does not apply to an adjustment in income, profits or
gains arising from Tax losses or Tax deductions not being available for
any period up to and including Completion.  
   

  

     2.  |   | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Seller shall not be liable under the indemnity contained
in clause 12.1 of this Agreement for any Tax Liability or any Claim relating
to Tax unless a Purchaser has given written notice to the Seller setting out
specific details of the Tax Liability within 6 years after the Completion
Date.  
---|---|--- 
      
  3.  |   | The Sellers total liability for any Tax Liability or Claim
relating to Tax is limited in aggregate to $7,500,000.

the Seller prior to the Completion Date.  
      
  2.  |   | INSURANCE CLAIMS  
      
    |   | The Seller shall ensure, or shall procure, that any event or
circumstance which gives rise to an insurance claim under any policy of
insurance taken out by the Seller but which provides cover for Borders
Australia, Borders NZ or Borders Singapore or any of their assets and which
occurs at any time prior to and including the Completion Date (but which is
not provided for in the Completion Balance Sheet), is the subject of a claim
prior to the Completion Date (or as soon as practicable thereafter) and is
otherwise dealt with in a timely manner and the Seller, subject to Completion
occurring, shall account to Borders Australia, Borders NZ or Borders
Singapore (as appropriate) in full for the proceeds of any claim which should
properly be received by Borders Australia, Borders NZ or Borders Singapore
(as appropriate) as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt less
any reasonable costs of recovery of the same.

Completion Accounts Principles  

  

Part A  Completion Accounts Principles 

   

     1  |   | The Completion Accounts will be prepared in accordance
with, in order of precedence:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the specific principles and policies set out in
Part B;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | where an item is not covered by the specific principles
and policies set out in Part B, the specific accounting principles and
policies used by the Group to prepare the Management Accounts, and
incorporating the methodology outlined in sub paragraph 2 of Part A of this
Schedule 9; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | to the extent that an item is not covered by the
accounting principles and policies referred to in paragraphs 1(a) or 1(b)
above and where not inconsistent with paragraph 1(a) or 1(b) above, in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( _US
GAAP_ ).  
   

  

     2  |   | The Completion Balance Sheet will be presented in the
same format as that set out in Part C of this Schedule 9 and will be
calculated by:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | aggregating the balance sheets of Borders
Australia, Borders NZ and Borders Singapore (prepared on the same basis as
the balance sheets contained in the Management Accounts) on a line-by-line
basis at the Completion Date; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | adjusting such aggregated balance sheet for the
adjustments listed in Part B of this Schedule 9.  
   

  

Part B  Completion adjustments 

   

The following adjustments will be applied in the preparation of the Completion
Balance Sheet:  

  

     1  |   | with the exception of GST balances, all tax balances
included in the Completion Accounts will prepared as following:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | all accrued taxes that are not payable by Borders
Australia, Borders NZ or Borders Singapore as at Completion will be adjusted
in the Completion Accounts such that they have a zero balance. For the
avoidance of doubt, such balances include "Accrued Federal Income Tax " and
"Accrued Foreign Income Tax"; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | a provision for tax will be included in the Completion
Accounts for accrued Australian, New Zealand and Singapore company tax
payable by Borders Australia, Borders NZ and Borders Singapore in respect of
the period up to and including Completion, but only to the extent these are
not paid as at Completion. For the avoidance of doubt the provision for tax
will be included in the Completion Accounts as a negative liability to the
extent that the amount of tax paid as at Completion is greater than the tax
payable as at Completion.  
   

  

     2  |   | any amounts which become payable by any member of the
Group in respect of any Lease (including under an Intra-Group Guarantee) as a
result of the entry by the Seller into this Agreement and/or any Transaction
Document or the performance by the Seller of its obligations under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document will be excluded from the
