their authorized representatives reasonable access to the offices, books and

Statement as calculated by the Buyer, not more than forty-five (45) days
after the date the Share Sellers receive the Final Purchase Price Statement,
the Share Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a written notice, specifying in
reasonable details all points of disagreement with the Buyers Final Purchase
Price Statement and setting out a revised Closing Balance Sheet, a revised

deemed to have been agreed upon for all purposes hereof. If no Notice of
Dispute is delivered by the Share Sellers to the Buyer within such forty-five
(45) day period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the Final Purchase
Price Statement has been agreed upon for all purposes hereof. Upon the Buyers
receipt of any Notice of Dispute, the Share Sellers and the Buyer shall
promptly consult with each other with respect to the specified points of
disagreement set forth in the Notice of Dispute in an effort to resolve the
dispute. If any such dispute cannot be resolved by the Share Sellers and the
Buyer within thirty (30) days after the Buyer receives the Notice of Dispute,
the Share Sellers and the Buyer shall jointly refer the dispute to an
international accounting firm that has no material relationship with either
of the Parties appointed by mutual agreement between the Parties or if the
Parties are unable to agree on such international accounting firm by the

for Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce, upon the request of
either Party (the " _Expert_ "), to finally resolve, as soon as practicable,
and in any event within sixty (60) days after such reference, all unresolved
points of disagreement with respect to the Final Purchase Price Statement. For
purposes of such determination by the Expert, each of the Share Sellers and
the Buyer shall submit to the Expert a proposed calculation of each disputed
issue and a written statement of its position. The Expert shall apply the
terms of this Agreement governing the determination of the different
components included in the Final Purchase Price Statement and in particular
the Accounting Principles and shall otherwise make its determination in
accordance with such procedures as the Parties may agree. In no event shall
the Expert assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either Party. The Experts determination shall be based solely on
written submissions by the Share Sellers and the Buyer (i.e., not an
independent review) and on the definitions included herein. Each of the
Parties shall bear its own expenses in connection with any such dispute,
except that the fees and expenses of the Expert shall be allocated by the
Expert. All determinations by the Expert shall be final, conclusive and
binding with respect to the Final Purchase Price Statement, in the absence of
fraud or manifest error.

the Share Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the amount in cash equal to the
excess of the Estimated Purchase Price over the Final Purchase Price.

shall be by wire transfer of immediately available funds, not more than
fifteen (15) days after final determination thereof, to an account to be
designated by the payee at least five (5) days prior to the due date.

(a) All sales, use, value-added, gross receipts, registration, stamp or other
similar transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transfer and sale of
the Shares, as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, including all
recording or filing fees, notarial fees and other similar costs of Closing,
that may be imposed upon, or payable, collectible or incurred, shall be borne
equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Share Sellers, on the other
hand. The Buyer and the Share Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts in good faith to minimize the applicability and amount of any such
transfer Taxes that may be assessed in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 2.5(a)or to the extent reflected in the
Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness, any Taxes with respect

Period or portion of a Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing
Date shall be borne by the Buyer.

 

(c) The Parties shall apportion any liability for Straddle Period Taxes in the
manner set forth in this Section 2.5(c). In the case of any Taxes that are

of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending as of
the end of business on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes
other than Taxes based upon or related to income, gross receipts, sales, use
or payroll be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending as of the end of business on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period, and (ii) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income,
gross receipts, sales, use, payroll, or imposed in connection with any sale
or other transfer or assignment of property (whether real or personal or
tangible or intangible), be deemed to be equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of business on the
Closing Date pursuant to an interim closing of the books. Any credits relating
to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the relevant
taxable period of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries
ended as of the end of business on the Closing Date.

 



20 (d) The Buyer and the Share Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished
to each other, upon request, as promptly as practical, such information
(including reasonable access to books and records) and assistance as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, the conduct of any Tax
audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax matter. The Buyer and the Share Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax audit or other Tax
proceedings. Any Tax audit or other Tax Proceeding with respect to a Pre-
Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be subject to the procedures set forth
in Section 2.5(e) below.

Subsidiaries) of any notice of any pending or threatened audit, examination or
assessment, suit, proposed adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative or
judicial proceeding or similar claim relating to any Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period (a " _Tax Claim_ " and collectively the " _Tax Claims_ "),
provided, however, that failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the
Share Sellers obligations for Taxes hereunder except to the extent the Share
Sellers are prejudiced thereby.

 

(ii) Buyer shall control representation with respect to any Tax Claim and the
Buyer shall take any and all actions with respect to the defense of all such
Tax Claims; _provided, however_ , the Share Sellers shall be entitled, at
their election and at their own expense, to observe and comment on any Tax
Claims, including employing counsel at their own expense;  _provided,
further_ , that the Buyer, irrespective of whether or not the Share Sellers
have elected to so participate in the defense of any such Tax Claim, may not
settle or compromise any such Tax Claim that increases a Tax for a Pre-
Closing Period or any portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
without the Share Sellers consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, but otherwise the Buyer shall be entitled to
settle, compromise or accept any judgment or final ruling with respect to any
such Tax Claim without the Share Sellers consent. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Share Sellers shall not, in any event, be entitled to observe or
participate in any portion of an audit, examination or assessment, suit,
proposed adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative or judicial
proceeding or similar claim to the extent such matter relates to (i) Post-
Closing Periods, or (ii) Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries or Indirect Subsidiaries. The Buyer shall keep the
Share Sellers reasonably informed with respect to the status and nature of any
such Tax Claims.

 

(f)

(i) The Share Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or
cause to be filed, all Tax Returns relating to Pre-Closing Periods of the

Buyer for all Taxes paid by Buyer or the Transferred Subsidiaries or Indirect
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date as a consequence of any such Tax Returns,
unless and to the extent accrued in the Closing Net Working Capital or Closing
Indebtedness, within fifteen (15) Business Days of payment of any such Taxes.

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared in a manner consistent
with Past Practice (except (A) as otherwise required by a change in
applicable law, (B) with the Share Sellers prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld), or (C) to the extent Buyer obtains written advice from
an internationally recognized accounting firm that a position taken with
respect to a Past Practice is not, more likely than not, to be sustained), and
file or caused to be filed, all Pre-Closing Period and Straddle Period Tax
Returns of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries, if
such Tax Returns are required to be filed after the Closing Date. With respect
to any Income Tax Return of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any Indirect
Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Period or a Straddle Period or any other Tax
Return to the extent such Tax Return relates to the payment or refund of any
Taxes for which the Share Sellers and their Affiliates are responsible or for
which they are the beneficiaries, if such Tax Returns are required to be filed
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide the Share Sellers and their
authorized representatives with copies of such completed Tax Return at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return. The Share
Sellers and their authorized representatives shall have the right to review
and comment on such Tax Return prior to the filing thereof. The Buyer and the
Share Sellers shall agree on any such Tax Returns prior to filing, and agree
to consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of the
review of such Tax Return by the Share Sellers or their authorized
representatives prior to the filing of such Tax Return, provided, however,
that in the event they are unable to agree, then the matter shall be referred
to the Expert, whose fees shall be borne as provided in Section 2.4(b) and
whose determination shall be final, conclusive and binding with respect to the
matters referred thereto, in the absence of fraud or manifest error. In the
event that the Expert has not resolved any item prior to the due date for
filing the applicable Tax Return or the parties have otherwise been unable to
agree, such Tax Return shall be filed as determined by Buyer, provided,
however, that Buyer shall amend any such Tax Return to the extent necessary
to conform to the final determination of the Expert. The Share Sellers shall
reimburse the Buyer for all Taxes paid by Buyer or the Transferred
Subsidiaries or Indirect Subsidiaries after the Closing Date for any Pre-
Closing Period or the Share Sellers allocable portion of any Straddle Period,
except to the extent accrued in the Closing Net Working Capital or Closing
Indebtedness, within fifteen (15) Business Days of payment of any such Taxes.

(iii) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
and assist the Share Sellers (at the Share Sellers sole cost and expense) in
amending any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Period to the extent
necessary to claim any refund or credit described in Section 2.5(g). If such
amendment would result in any increased Tax liability in the Post-Closing
Period or the portion of any Straddle Period after the Closing Date, the Share
Sellers shall indemnify Buyer for any Taxes paid by Buyer as a result of such
amendment.

 



22 (iv) The Buyer shall not cause or permit any Transferred Subsidiary,
Indirect Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Buyer to amend any Tax Return without
the prior written consent of the Share Sellers, not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, except as otherwise required by applicable
law.

 

(v) The Buyer shall, and shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary and Indirect
Subsidiary to, make any available elections to waive the right to carry back
any Tax Attribute from a taxable period or portion thereof ending after the
Threshold Date to a taxable period or portion thereof ending on or prior to
the Threshold Date, unless the Share Sellers give the Buyer prior written
consent, such consent to be exercised in the Share Sellers sole discretion,
to not make such elections.

(g) The Buyer shall promptly pay or shall cause prompt payment to be made to
the Share Sellers of all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by, or
credited against Tax liability of the Buyer, any Affiliate of the Buyer, or
any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary attributable to any Pre-
Closing Period or a portion of a Straddle Period ending as of the end of
business on the Closing Date, net of any Taxes (or Taxes resulting from a
distribution of such refunded amount by any Transferred Subsidiary or
Indirect Subsidiary) or out of pocket expenses incurred by the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates with respect to such refund or credit. To the extent such
refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to
the applicable Governmental Authority, the Share Sellers agree promptly to
repay the amount of such refund or credit, together with any interest,
penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Governmental Authority,
to the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall this Section
2.5(g) require that the Buyer, or Affiliates (including the Transferred
Subsidiaries and Indirect Subsidiaries) make any payment with respect to any
Tax refund (and such refund shall be for the benefit of Buyer or Affiliates,
as applicable) that is with respect to (i) any refund that is the result of
the carrying back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any net operating loss or
other Tax attribute or Tax credit relating to a Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) any refund resulting from the
payment of Taxes made on or after the Closing Date to the extent (X) the Buyer
was not indemnified or otherwise reimbursed for such Taxes or (Y) such Taxes
were not taken into account in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital
or Closing Indebtedness, or (iii) any refund that gives rise to a payment
obligation by Buyer or Affiliates to any person under applicable Laws
or pursuant to a provision of a contract or other agreement entered (or
assumed) by any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary on or prior to
the Closing Date.

 

(h) All Tax sharing or similar agreements to which any Transferred Subsidiary
or Indirect Subsidiary is a party (other than (1) the Tax Matters Agreement
between Covidien plc and Mallinckrodt plc dated June 28, 2013 (the " _Covidien
Tax Matters Agreement_ ") and (2) those Tax sharing or similar agreements to
which any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary is a party with
another Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary which the Buyer requests
in writing to the Share Sellers not be terminated as of the end of business on
the Closing Date) shall be terminated as of the end of business on the
Closing Date and, after such date, no Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect
Subsidiary shall be bound thereby or have any rights or obligations
thereunder.

 



23 (i) For the avoidance of doubt, Share Sellers shall not be liable for any Tax
that could result if Buyer effects a Section 338 election with respect to any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or files IRS Form 8832 to
elect to treat any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary as a
partnership or disregarded entity pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-3.

2.6 _Allocation of Estimated Purchase Price and Final Purchase Price_.

 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Parties
shall set forth on _Schedule 2.6(a)_ the allocation of the Estimated Purchase
Price among each of the Transferred Subsidiaries and among each of the
Indirect Subsidiaries. Subject to Section 2.6(b) below, the Share Sellers and
the Buyer shall report the acquisition of the Shares for all Tax purposes in
a manner consistent with such allocation (taking into account any Closing
Adjustment Amount or portion thereof as an adjustment to the Estimated
Purchase Price allocated to the appropriate entity), and shall take no
position inconsistent therewith or contrary thereto. Subject to Section
2.6(b) below, the allocation may not be amended or changed without the mutual
written consent of the Parties.

 

(b) Within sixty (60) days after final determination (by agreement or
otherwise) of the Final Purchase Price, the Share Sellers shall prepare and
deliver to the Buyer, for its review, a schedule allocating the Final Purchase
Price and assumed liabilities (to the extent included in "amount realized" for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the purchased assets and
the covenants set forth in Section 6.8 in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate
(the " _Allocation_ "). The Buyer shall have the right, for forty five (45)
days after such delivery, to provide reasonable, written comments to such
draft Allocation. If the Buyer does not object to such draft Allocation within
such 45-day period, such Allocation shall be final and binding on the Parties
and the Parties will report such Allocation and take no Tax position contrary
thereto. The Buyer and the Share Sellers shall negotiate in good faith for
thirty (30) days after any comments are delivered in an attempt to resolve any
disagreements between them with respect to such draft Allocation. If the
Buyer and the Share Sellers are unable to agree on the Allocation, then the
Expert shall resolve the dispute in a manner consistent with the provisions of
Section 2.4(b), and the Allocation, as resolved by the Expert, shall be
binding on the Parties.

2.7 _Completion of Transfers and Assurance of Beneficial Interest_.

(a) The entire beneficial interest in and to, and the risk of loss with
respect to, the Business Assets (and any liabilities related thereto), shall
pass to the Buyer at Closing as of the Effective Time. All operations of the
Business shall be for the account of the Share Sellers up to and including the
Effective Time and shall be for the account of the Buyer thereafter. In the
event that, notwithstanding the sale of the Shares hereunder at Closing, legal
title to any of the Business Assets is not fully transferred or transferable
at Closing, the seller of the Shares of the Transferred Subsidiary
(and, indirectly, any Indirect Subsidiary owned by such Transferred
Subsidiary) holding such Business Assets shall hold such Business Assets as
nominee for the Buyer until completion of such transfers in accordance with
the provisions of Sections 2.7(b) and 2.7(c) set forth below, unless and to
the extent of any specific arrangements agreed upon by the Parties that are
contemplated by the provisions of Section 2.8 below.

 



24 (b) In the event that the legal interest in any of the Business Assets to be
transferred or conveyed pursuant to this Agreement, or any claim, right or
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom cannot be transferred or
conveyed hereunder as of the Closing Date because any waiting or notice period
has not expired or any consents or approvals required for such transfer have
not been obtained or waived, then the legal interest in such Business Assets
shall not be deemed to be transferred or conveyed unless and until such
waiting or notice period shall have expired or until approval, consent or
waiver thereof is obtained. Except as set forth in Section 6.7 with respect to
Competition Filings, the Share Sellers and their applicable Affiliates shall,
and the Buyer shall and shall cause its designated Affiliates, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in obtaining such consents,
approvals or waivers as may be necessary to complete such transfers as soon as
practicable. Any out-of pocket cost or expenses in connection with obtaining
such consents, approvals or waivers shall be borne by the Share Sellers or
their Affiliates, except as and to the extent specifically set forth in any
Transition Services Agreement or as may otherwise specifically be agreed to
herein. Except as set forth in Section 7.2, Section 7.3, Section 7.4 and
Section 8.2, the failure of the Share Sellers to obtain any required consents,
approvals or waivers prior to Closing shall not affect the Buyers obligations
to close under this Agreement or to pay, or cause to be paid, the Estimated
Purchase Price. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to
assign to the Buyer any legal interest in any of the Business Assets which, as
a matter of law or by the terms of any legally binding contract, engagement
or commitment to which any of the Share Sellers, the Transferred Subsidiaries
or the Indirect Subsidiaries is subject, is not assignable without the consent
of any other party, unless such consent shall have been given or the
requirement of such consent shall have been waived in writing by such other
party.

(c) Pending the conveyances and transfers referred to in Section 2.7(b), the
Share Sellers shall hold any such Business Assets that cannot be conveyed or
transferred for the benefit and at the risk of the Buyer and shall cooperate
with the Buyer in any lawful and reasonable arrangements designed to provide
the benefits of ownership thereof to the Buyer, including, without limitation,
those arrangements that will be set forth in and governed by the terms of any
Transition Services Agreement.

 

2.8 _Transition Services Agreement_.

 

(a) The Business Assets include some assets and obligations, in particular
(but without limitation) Marketing Authorizations and certain Contracts, that
will require the consent of one or more Governmental Authorities or third
parties for their final transfer, conveyance or assignment to the Buyer or one
of its Affiliates. In that regard, the Share Sellers (and such of
their Affiliates as may be required in any particular circumstances) will
provide to the Buyer and its Affiliates certain services after the Closing
Date, including commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Marketing
Authorizations and material Contracts that are part of the Business Assets
purchased hereunder by the Buyer are transferred, conveyed and assigned to the
Buyer or its Affiliates as soon as reasonably possible. With respect to the
Marketing Authorizations in particular, until such time as the Marketing
Authorization for any product(s) of the Business relative to any particular
jurisdiction can be transferred, conveyed and assigned to the Buyer or one of
its Affiliates with full legal effect, then, with respect to such product(s)
and such jurisdiction, the Share Sellers and/or their Affiliates will engage
in such activities as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that the
marketing, sale and distribution of

 



25  such product(s) in such jurisdiction is accomplished in substantially the
manner in which such activities were carried on prior to the Effective Time
and that the Buyer and its Affiliates receives any economic benefit or
detriment that is associated with such activities. The details of such
activities for each product and jurisdiction shall be reflected in appropriate
exhibits and attachments to the Transition Services Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not be deemed to affect the Buyers
right not to close the transactions contemplated herein as a consequence of
the failure to meet the condition to Closing set forth in Section 7.3.

 

(b) The Transition Services Agreement will also provide for the provision to
the Buyer and its Affiliates by the Share Sellers and their Affiliates
certain corporate and support services in support of the Business generally or
with respect to multiple jurisdictions, for a limited period of time and for
reasonable consideration, any of which will be set forth in greater detail
in exhibits and attachments to the Transition Services Agreement.

(c) The Transition Services Agreement, subject to the preparation of
its exhibits and attachments by the Parties during the period between the
execution hereof and the Closing, will be substantially in the form of the
agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

 

2.9 _Excluded Assets_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, (i) the Share Sellers shall cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries to transfer to other Affiliates of
the Share Sellers, without consideration allocable pursuant to Section 2.6,
any assets owned by them which are Excluded Assets, and (ii) the Share Sellers
shall take reasonable best efforts to ensure that no Excluded Assets are
conveyed or transferred to the Buyer in connection herewith. Any and all costs
and expenses incurred in transferring ownership of the Excluded Assets from
the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries to other Affiliates
of the Share Sellers, including, but not limited to, applicable Taxes,
recording and filing fees and preparation of transfer documents, whether
incurred before or after Closing, shall be borne by the Share Sellers.

 

(b) To the extent permitted by law and regardless of whether or not in any
given circumstance the Share Sellers have complied fully with
the requirements of Section 2.9(a) above, the entire beneficial interest in
and to, and the risk of loss with respect to, the Excluded Assets (whether or
not owned by any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Indirect
Subsidiaries), shall, regardless of when legal title is transferred, pass to
the Share Sellers or their designated Affiliates at Closing as of the
Effective Time. All benefits of ownership and liabilities with respect to all
Excluded Assets shall be for the account of the Share Sellers and their
Affiliates at all times.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 7.2, Section 7.5 and Section 8.2, in the
event that the legal interest in any of the Excluded Assets owned by the
Transferred Subsidiaries or the Indirect Subsidiaries to be transferred or
conveyed as contemplated by this Section 2.9, or any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom cannot be transferred or conveyed
to another Affiliate of the Share Sellers that is not a Transferred Subsidiary
or Indirect Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date because any waiting or
notice period has not expired or any consents or approvals required for such
transfer or conveyance have not yet been obtained or waived, then the legal
interest in such Excluded Assets shall not be

 



26  transferred or conveyed unless and until such waiting period has expired or
until such an approval, consent or waiver thereof is obtained. Except as set
forth in Section 6.7 with respect to Competition Filings, the Share Sellers
shall, and the Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates, all at the expense
of the Share Sellers and their Affiliates, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consents, waivers or approvals as may be necessary to
complete such assignments, transfers or waivers and to obtain satisfaction of
conditions to transfer as soon as practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed as an attempt to assign to any Affiliate of the Share Sellers
that is not a Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary any Excluded
Assets which, as a matter of law or by the terms of any contract, engagement
or commitment to which any Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary is
subject, is not assignable without the consent of any other party, unless
such consents shall have been given or the requirement for such consent shall
have been waived in writing by such other party.

 

(d) Pending the conveyances and transfers referred to above in Section 2.9(c),
the Buyer or its Affiliates shall cause the relevant Transferred Subsidiary
or Indirect Subsidiary to hold any such non-assignable Excluded Assets for the
benefit and at the risk of the Share Sellers and their Affiliates and to
cooperate with the Share Sellers in any lawful and reasonable
arrangements designed to provide the benefits of ownership thereof to the
Share Sellers and their Affiliates, at the expense and for the account of the
Share Sellers.

 

2.10 _Certain Costs and Expenses_. The Share Sellers shall bear all costs and
expenses (if any) associated with the assignment, transfer and conveyance to
the Buyer and its Affiliates, and the recordation by them, of any Business
Assets that are Intellectual Property or real property (i.e., the Raleigh
Plant, the Montreal Plant, the Dublin Plant, the Cincinnati Plant and any
Real Property Leases) or any other Business Assets for which any such cost,
expense and/or recordation may be required for effective transfer.

of their Affiliates has been asserted.

(g) Commercially reasonable actions have been taken to maintain and protect
the confidentiality of any material Business Know-How or other material

Affiliates have good and marketable title to all such items of such Business
Intellectual Property and, except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule
3.19(d)_ and _Disclosure Schedule 3.19(h),_ there is no ownership interest
agreement, covenant, option or other right, title, or interest outstanding in

3.21 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) _Disclosure Schedule 3.21(a)_ lists all written material employee benefit
plans and programs of the Share Sellers and their ERISA Affiliates (including
any plans and programs maintained by, contributed to, or covering any
Employees of the Share Sellers or any ERISA Affiliates, or to which the Share
Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate may have any obligation), in each case
in respect of the Business, or otherwise applicable to Employees as of the
date hereof, including all such employee benefit plans within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA and all other plans and
programs providing for pension, retirement (qualified and non-qualified),
profit sharing, savings, bonus, deferred or incentive compensation, change in
control payment, hospitalization, medical, life or disability insurance, paid
time off and paid holiday, termination or severance pay, stock purchase,
restricted stock, stock option, performance shares or stock appreciation
rights benefit plans (" _Benefit Plans_ "). Benefit Plans maintained in the
United States or otherwise subject to ERISA are hereinafter referred to as "
_U.S. Benefit Plans_ " and other Benefit Plans are referred to as " _Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans_." U.S. Benefit Plans include both arrangements which are
subject to ERISA (" _ERISA Plans_ ") and arrangements which are not subject
to ERISA (" _Non-ERISA Plans_ "). Benefit Plans that are either (i) maintained
by a Transferred Subsidiary or an Indirect Subsidiary, or (ii) Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans that shall be assigned to the Buyer are hereinafter
collectively referred to as " _Transferred Benefit Plans_ ", and those plans
are identified on _Disclosure Schedule 3.21(a)_. For the purposes of this
Section 3.21, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any entity that would have ever
been considered a single employer with any Share Seller under Section 4001(b)
of ERISA or part of the same "controlled group" as the Share Sellers for
purposes of Section 302(d)(3) of ERISA.

 



43 (b) _U.S. Benefit Plans_. __

 

(i) With respect to each U.S. Benefit Plan, including both ERISA Plans and
Non-ERISA Plans, the Share Sellers have made available to the Buyer a copy of
the plan documents and any applicable summaries thereof and, if applicable,
the most recent copies of the following: summary plan description or other
written summary, actuarial estimates of Benefit Plan liabilities, Form 5500
with all attachments for the last year, financial statements for the Benefit
Plans for the last year, trust agreements, and determination or qualification
letter from the IRS.

 

(ii) Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule 3.21(b)(ii)_ , the U.S.
Benefit Plans, including both ERISA Plans and Non-ERISA Plans, have been
maintained and administered in compliance in all material respects with the
terms of such plans and with applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.

 

(iii) There are no suits, actions, disputes, claims (other than routine claims
for benefits), arbitrations, administrative or other Proceedings pending or,
to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened with respect to or in any manner
relating to the maintenance or administration of any U.S. Benefit Plan,
including both ERISA Plans and Non-ERISA Plans, and to the Sellers
Knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for any such Proceeding or claim. All
payments and/or contributions required to have been made with respect to all
U.S. Benefit Plans either have been made or have been accrued in accordance
with the terms of the applicable U.S. Benefit Plan and applicable law.

ERISA Plans and Non-ERISA Plans) that is not a Transferred Benefit Plan for

ERISA, except as set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.21(b)(iv)_.
The execution and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
by the Share Sellers and their Affiliates will not (i) result in, or cause the
accelerated vesting payment, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or
value of, any payment or benefit to any Employee; (ii) result in any
"parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code; or (iii)
result in a requirement to pay any tax "gross-up" or similar "make-
whole" payments to any Employee.

(v) _Disclosure Schedule 3.21(a)(v)_ identifies each of the U.S. Benefit Plans
that is an ERISA Plan and is intended to meet the requirements of Section
401(a) of the Code (the " _Qualified Plans_ "). With respect to the Qualified
Plans, all IRS qualification determination letters remain in effect and have
not been revoked. Each Qualified Plan has received a favorable determination
or approval letter from the IRS with respect to such qualification, or may
rely on an opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to a prototype plan
adopted in accordance with the requirements for such reliance, or has time
remaining for application to the IRS for a determination of the qualified
status of such Qualified Plan for any period for which such Qualified Plan
would not otherwise be covered by an IRS determination and, to the Sellers
Knowledge, no event or omission has occurred that would cause any Qualified
Plan to lose such qualification.

 

(vi) Each Qualified Plan has been administered materially according to its
terms, except (i) for those terms that are inconsistent with the changes

 



44  required by statutes, regulations, and rulings for which changes are not yet
required to be made, in which case each Qualified Plan has been administered
in all material respects in accordance with the provision of applicable
statutes, regulations and rulings.

(vii) No Qualified Plan has suffered any material "accumulated funding
deficiency," within the meaning of ERISA Section 302 and Section 412 of the
Code, whether or not waived. The Share Sellers and their ERISA Affiliates have
made full and timely payment of, or have accrued pending full and timely
payment of, all material amounts which are required, under the terms of each
Qualified Plan and in accordance with applicable Laws, to be paid as a
contribution to each Qualified Plan.

 

(viii) None of the U.S. Benefit Plans is and since December 31, 2012, the
Share Sellers and their ERISA Affiliates have never contributed to, nor have
any liability with respect to, any "multi employer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 

(ix) None of the Share Sellers nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has any
liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any
Benefit Plan other than current premiums payable to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation in the Ordinary Course. Except as set forth on
_Disclosure Schedule 3.21(b)(ix)_ , there has been no "reportable event," as
defined in Section 4043(b) or (c) of ERISA, with any respect to any Benefit
Plan, for which notice has not been waived.

 

(x) None of the Share Sellers nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has made nor
are they obligated to make any material contributions to any Qualified Plan
that are nondeductible for Tax purposes.

(xi) Except as listed in _Disclosure Schedule 3.21(b)(xi)_ , no U.S. Benefit
Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA. With respect to any U.S. Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, none of the
following has occurred or existed, nor will any of the following occur or
exist as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement an event
or condition which presents a material risk of a plan termination or any
other event that may cause the Share Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate to incur
liability or have a lien imposed on its assets under Title IV of ERISA. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 3.21(b)(xi)_ , the actuarial present value of the
accumulated plan benefits (whether or not vested) under each U.S. Benefit Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code as of the last day of
its most recent plan year did not exceed the market value of the
assets allocable thereto, and, since such date, there has been no material
adverse change in the financial condition of each such U.S. Benefit Plan.

 

(xii) None of the Share Sellers or any of their ERISA Affiliates has engaged
in any "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or
ERISA Section 406 with respect to the U.S. Benefit Plans, and, to the Sellers
Knowledge, all "fiduciaries," as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA, with
respect to the U.S. Benefit Plans, have materially complied with the
requirements of Section 404 of ERISA.

 



45 (xiii) Other than routine claims for benefits, with respect to both ERISA
Plans and Non-ERISA Plans, there are no material actions, audits,
investigations, suits, or claims pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge,
threatened against any of the U.S. Benefit Plans or any fiduciary thereof or
against the assets of any of the U.S. Benefit Plans.

(xiv) With respect to each Welfare Plan: (i) each such plan which is intended
to meet the requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of
Chapter 1 of the Code meets such requirements, (ii) there is no disqualified
benefit (as such term is defined in Code Section 4976(b)) which would subject
the Buyer to a tax under Code Section 4976(a), (iii) each such plan which is a
group health plan (as such term is defined in Code Section 5001(b)) complies
and in each case has been operated in material compliance with the applicable
requirements of Code Section 4980B, Title I, Part 6 of ERISA, HIPAA and any
applicable state and local laws, and (iv) to the extent applicable, each such
plan is in material compliance with Section 1862(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Social
Security Act and the Share Sellers and their Affiliates do not have any
liability for any excise tax imposed by Code Section 5000\.

 

(xv) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.21(b)(xv)_ , none of the U.S. Benefit
Plans provides health care or any other non-pension benefits to any
Transferred Employees after their employment is terminated (other than as
required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or similar state law) and
the Share Sellers have never promised to provide to the Transferred Employees
such post-termination benefits.

(xvi) Each U.S. Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code has been operated and maintained in all material respects in
operational and documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and
applicable guidance thereunder. No payment to be made under any U.S. Benefit
Plan is, or to the knowledge of the Share Sellers, will be, subject to the
penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

 

(c) _Non-U.S. Benefit Plans_.

 

(i) With respect to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, the Share Sellers have made
available to the Buyer a copy of the plan documents or any applicable
summaries thereof, and where applicable, the most recent copies of the
following: summary plan description, financial statements for the Benefit
Plans and all trust agreements, if and as they exist and, in respect to
the Transferred Employees employed by an Irish Share Seller or Affiliate,
there is not in operation, and none of the Irish Share Sellers or any of their
Affiliates have at any previous time contributed to, and no proposal has been
announced to enter into or establish, and there is no present, future or
contingent obligation in respect of any agreement, arrangement, undertaking,
custom or practice for the payment of, or payment of a contribution towards,
any pensions, allowances, gratuitous payments, lump sums or other similar
benefits on retirement, death,

 



46  termination of employment (whether voluntary or not) or during periods of
sickness or disablement (whether during service or after retirement) for the
benefit of any Transferred Employees employed by an Irish Share Seller or
Affiliate except as set forth in a Non-US Benefit Plan as identified on
_Disclosure Schedule 3.21(a)_.

 

(ii) Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule 3.21(c)(ii)_ , the Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans have been established, maintained, funded, qualified and
administered in material compliance with applicable Laws and governing
documentation. Each of the Irish Retirement Schemes is a defined contribution
scheme, was established as such, was not established in succession to, and
has not previously been converted from a defined benefit scheme, and none of
the Transferred Employees employed by an Irish Share Seller or Affiliate have
been promised or are entitled to receive defined benefit pensions as a result
of employment with the Share Sellers or any of their Affiliates or due to the
transfer of their employment from another entity into the Share Sellers or any
of their Affiliates. Each of the Transferred Employees employed by an Irish
Share Seller or Affiliate who has completed six months employment with an
Irish Share Seller or Affiliate is eligible to participate in an Irish
Retirement Scheme or, if not, each of Irish Share Seller or Affiliates has
complied with its obligations under Section 121 of the Irish Pensions Act.

(iii) To Sellers Knowledge, there are no suits, actions, disputes, claims
(other than routine claims for benefits), arbitrations, administrative or
other Proceedings pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened with
respect to or in any manner relating to the maintenance or administration of
any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan and to the Sellers Knowledge, there is no
reasonable basis for any such suit, action, dispute, claim arbitration or
Proceeding. All payments and/or contributions required to have been made with
respect to all Non-U.S. Benefit Plans either have been made in material
compliance with the terms of the applicable Non-U.S. Benefit Plan and
applicable Law.

Transferred Benefit Plans for which the Buyer or its Affiliates may be
liable, except as set forth on the Financial Statements or as set forth on
_Disclosure Schedule 3.21(c)(iv)_, and the execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by the Share Sellers and their
Affiliates will not cause any new liability to occur or enhance any existing
liability (e.g., increase in severance, the vesting, amount or timing of any
compensation or benefits, etc.). No assurance, promise or guarantee (whether
oral or written) has been made or given to any member of the Irish Retirement
Scheme or any Transferred Employees employed by an Irish Share Seller or
Affiliate of any particular level or amount of benefits (other than insured
lump sum death in service benefits) to be provided for or in respect of such
member other than under the Irish Retirement Schemes on retirement, death or
leaving service.

 

(v) Other than routine claims for benefits, there are no material actions,
audits, investigations, suits, or claims pending or, to the Sellers

fiduciary thereof or against the assets of any of the Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

the transactions contemplated hereby will not accelerate or increase any of
the rights or benefits to which Employees may be entitled under any Benefit
Plan.

2012, none of the Share Sellers or any of their Affiliates, agents,
distributors, employees or other person associated with or acting on their
behalf has, directly or indirectly, (i) taken any action which would cause the
Business to be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended, any applicable Law implementing the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public
Officials in International Business or any rules or regulations thereunder, or
any similar anti-corruption or anti-bribery law applicable to any of the
Share Sellers or any of their Affiliates, in each case in respect of the
Business, in any jurisdiction (collectively, " _Anti-Corruption Laws_ "), or

whether directly or indirectly. Since December 31, 2012, the Share Sellers and
their Affiliates, agents, employees, and other persons associated with or
acting on their behalf, in each case in respect of the Business, have
conducted their export transactions in accordance with (i) all applicable U.S.

consummation of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 _EMPLOYEES_

5.1  _The Buyer s Obligations_.

(a) After the Closing Date (i) where applicable law or rules provide for the
automatic transfer of employment of any portion of the Employees upon the
sale of the Business by operation of law or otherwise, (A) the Buyer and the
Share Sellers agree to take such actions as are reasonably practicable such
that the employment of the Employees will transfer to the Buyer or its
Affiliate as a matter of law as of the Effective Time, and (B) the Buyer or
one of its Affiliates shall employ each such Employee with salary, wages,
bonuses and/or incentive compensation (as applicable in any given case) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those payable by the Share
Sellers or their Affiliates to each such Employee on the Closing Date, shall
provide benefits to each such Employee that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the benefits provided by the Share Sellers or their
Affiliates to each such Employee on the Closing Date (excluding any grants of
stock options, restricted stock or any other equity that may be provided by
the Share Sellers or their Affiliates to any such Employee and benefits under
the Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan)), and (ii)
where applicable Law or rules do not provide for the automatic transfer of
employment of any portion of the Employees upon the sale of the Business, the
Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall make an offer of employment, to be
effective as of the day after the Closing Date, with salary, wages, bonuses
and/or incentive compensation (as applicable in any given case) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those payable by the Share
Sellers or their Affiliates to each such Employee on the Closing Date, with
benefits to each such Employee that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided by the Share Sellers or their Affiliates
to each such Employee on the Closing Date (excluding any grants of stock
options, restricted stock or any other equity that may be provided by the
Share Sellers or their Affiliates to any such Employee).

(b) The Buyer and the Share Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to take any and all required actions necessary to minimize to the greatest
extent practicable the possibility that severance benefits and/or government
required termination liabilities shall be payable to an Employee as a
consequence of the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
regardless of whether such Employee becomes employed by the Buyer or one of
its Affiliates automatically or by the acceptance of any offer of employment.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall abridge the Buyers right to terminate any
U.S. Transferred Employee, or alter any U.S. Transferred Employees terms and
conditions of employment post-Closing, including such U.S. Transferred
Employees levels of compensation and benefits, _provided that_ if the Buyer
terminates any U.S. Transferred Employee 

 



51  without Cause at any time within six months after the Closing Date, or if an
U.S. Transferred Employee terminates for Good Reason at any time within six
months after the Closing Date, then the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer
must pay severance pay to such terminated U.S. Transferred Employee that is no
less favorable than the greatest of (A) two (2) weeks pay per year of service,
and (B) a minimum of seven (7) weeks of pay and a maximum of fifty-two (52)
weeks of pay or (C) any amount required by applicable Law in any jurisdiction.
The Buyer hereby agrees to communicate the severance arrangement set forth in
the preceding sentence to U.S. Transferred Employees in writing within ten
(10) days following the Closing Date.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall abridge the Buyers right to terminate
any Non-U.S. Transferred Employee, or alter any Non-U.S. Transferred
Employees terms and conditions of employment post-Closing, including such
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees levels of compensation and benefits, 
_provided that_ if the Buyer terminates any Non-U.S. Transferred Employee
without Cause at any time within six months after the Closing Date, or if a
Non-U.S. Transferred Employee terminates for Good Reason at any time within
six months after the Closing Date, then the Buyer or an Affiliate of the
Buyer must pay severance to such terminated Non-U.S. Transferred Employee that
is no less favorable than the severance plan in place for the entity by which
such Non-U.S. Transferred Employee is employed. The Buyer hereby agrees to
communicate the severance arrangement set forth in the preceding sentence to
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees in writing within ten (10) days following the
Closing Date.

 

(e) The Buyer shall credit (or cause to be credited) service accrued by
Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date for all purposes under its
Benefit Plans (other than for purposes of determining any accrued benefit
under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result in a duplication of
benefits), and where required by Law, for all other employment-related
purposes.

 

(f) After the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in welfare benefit plans
(including any applicable Welfare Plans, as defined hereunder) of the Buyer or
one of its Affiliates made available to such Transferred Employees (to the
extent that coverage replaces coverage under a comparable welfare benefit plan
of any of the Share Sellers or any of their Affiliates, in which such
Transferred Employee participated as of the Closing Date). For purposes of
each welfare benefit plan of the Buyer or one of its Affiliates providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred
Employee, the Buyer shall cause all material pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such plans to be waived for such
Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents (other than
limitations or waiting periods that were already in effect with respect to
such Employees and dependents and that have not been satisfied as of the
Closing Date).

 

(g) With respect to Benefit Plans in which benefits are subject to co-
payments, deductibles or similar thresholds, after the Closing Date the Buyer
or its Affiliates will, with respect to its comparable benefit plans, take any
and all required actions necessary to give full credit for all co-payments and
deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective Time in the same plan year as if
there had been a single continuous employer and shall take into account any
amounts previously paid and thresholds previously met for the benefit of each
Transferred Employee towards any applicable annual and/or lifetime maximum
benefits.

 



52 (h) During the one (1)-year period commencing with the Closing Date, neither
the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall solicit or attempt to solicit the
employment, in connection with the Business, of any employee of the Share
Sellers or any of their Affiliates who is not an Employee without the prior
written consent of the Share Sellers. This Section 5.1(h) shall not be
construed to prohibit the Buyers and its Affiliates job postings,
solicitations and advertising designed for and distributed to the general
public rather than targeted at any employee of the Share Sellers or any of
their Affiliates who is not an Employee.

5.2 _U.S. Employment Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer of Employment_. Effective as of the day after the Closing Date
and in accordance with the principles set forth in Section 5.1 above
regarding salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive compensation, coverage under
benefit plans and severance, the Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall offer
employment to or continue the employment of each Employee employed by
the Business in the United States (" _U.S. Transferred Employees_ ").

(b) _Cessation of Coverage under Mallinckrodt Plans_. Except as may be agreed
to between the Buyer and the Share Sellers, effective as of the day after the
Closing Date, U.S. Transferred Employees shall cease to be active participants
in any remaining Benefit Plans of the Share Sellers or their Affiliates and
all such persons shall become eligible to participate in the Transferred
Benefit Plans or in such benefit plans to be established by the Buyer or one
of its Affiliates in connection with the Buyers obligations hereunder. 

(c)

(i)  _Transferred Benefit Plans_. On and as of the day after the Closing
Date, the Transferred Benefit Plans for U.S. Transferred Employees shall
continue to be sponsored and maintained by a Transferred Subsidiary, an
Indirect Subsidiary, the Buyer or another Affiliate of the Buyer, and the
Share Sellers and their Affiliates shall have no further liability or
obligation therefor.

 

(ii) _Individual Account Plans_. The Share Sellers shall, effective as of the
day after the Closing Date, cease all contributions in respect of each U.S.
Transferred Employee in Mallinckrodts tax-qualified and nonqualified defined
contribution plans, and any health savings account in which such individual is
then participating. As of the day after the Closing Date, the Buyer or one of
its Affiliates shall have in effect one or more qualified defined contribution
plans, that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (" _Buyer s 401(k) Plan_"). Each U.S.
Transferred Employee who was a participant in one or more of the Qualified
Plans that are individual account plans identified on _Disclosure Schedule
3.21(b)(v)_  (" _Mallinckrodt s Savings Programs_") immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, subject to published black-out periods, become a
participant in Buyers 401(k) Plan as of the day after the Closing Date.
Buyers 401(k) Plan shall accept rollover contributions from Mallinckrodts
Savings Programs on behalf of U.S. Transferred Employees, including a rollover
of any outstanding loan balance and related promissory notes in accordance
with reasonable procedures adopted by the Share Sellers and the Buyer,
including a limitation on the time period in which such loan rollovers may

 



53  be elected. A rollover from Mallinckrodts Savings Programs which includes a
loan balance and related promissory note must be initiated by a U.S.
Transferred Employee within a reasonable period following the Effective Time
that is determined by the Share Sellers to be acceptable and to which the
Buyer consents. Both the Share Sellers (or their appropriate Affiliates) and
the Buyer shall amend their respective plans to permit the loan rollovers
provided for in this Section 5.2(c)(ii).

(d) _Mallinckrodt Pension Plan_. The Share Sellers or their
Affiliates maintain one or more defined benefit pension plans that provide
benefits to Employees who will become U.S. Transferred Employees ("
_Mallinckrodt Pension Plan_ "). Such plans are not Transferred Benefit Plans,
and neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate of the Buyer shall become the sponsor
of any Mallinckrodt Pension Plan by operation of the events contemplated in
this Agreement. The Share Sellers and their Affiliates shall cause any
Mallinckrodt Pension Plan to make direct payment of any accrued benefits to
U.S. Transferred Employees (and their beneficiaries) at the time and amount
and in the manner required by the terms of the applicable Mallinckrodt Pension
Plan. To the extent any U.S. Transferred Employee participates in
a Mallinckrodt Pension Plan and is actively accruing additional benefits on
the Closing Date, he or she shall cease to be eligible for such accruals
effective on the day after the Closing Date.

 

(e) _Welfare Plans_. __

shall and their Affiliates be responsible for all medical, dental and other
claims for expenses incurred on or prior to the Closing Date by U.S.

Employees or spouses and dependents after the Closing Date under group life,
travel, disability accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance
policies of the Buyer or similar Welfare Plans in which U.S. Transferred
Employees and/or spouses and dependents become enrolled. The Share Sellers

policies of the Share Sellers and their Affiliates by U.S. Transferred
Employees on or before the Closing Date, regardless of whether or not claims
are filed on or before the Closing Date and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of any such Welfare Plans.

during the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs. Buyer shall have no
liability with respect to amounts earned under such plans as of the Closing
Date. Bonus and incentive compensation earned by U.S. Transferred Employees
after the Closing Date shall be pursuant to plans adopted by Buyer or one of
its Affiliates in accordance with the otherwise applicable provisions of this
Section 5.2.

Employees on terms and conditions substantially consistent with Section 5.1
hereof.

their Affiliates.

 

5.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No agreement between the parties hereto
nor any action by the Share Sellers, the Buyer or any of their Affiliates
shall be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any employees
of the Share Sellers, the Buyer, or of any Affiliate of either, and no person
other than the Parties to this Agreement shall have any rights to enforce any
provision hereof. Further, nothing in this Article 5 shall be deemed to amend
or modify any Benefit Plan.

5.7 _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. Notwithstanding the preceding
portions of this Article 5, no provision hereof shall be construed as varying
any of the rights or benefits of any Employee covered by any union contract,
collective bargaining agreement, works council or any similar agreement or

Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the later of (i) the expiration of any
applicable statutes of limitations and (ii) seven (7) years after the
Threshold Date, the Buyer shall retain records, documents, accounting data
and other information (including computer data) necessary for the preparation
and filing of all Tax Returns (" _Tax Records_ ") in respect of Taxes of any
of the Transferred Subsidiaries or Indirect Subsidiaries. At any time after
the Closing Date that the Buyer proposes to destroy any such Tax Records, it
shall first notify the Share Sellers in writing and the Share Sellers shall be
entitled to receive such materials or information proposed to be destroyed if
the Share Sellers so notify Buyer in writing, provided that the Share Sellers
notify Buyer in writing within thirty (30) days from the day the Share Sellers
receive the requisite notification from Buyer.

 



62 6.5 _Confidentiality; Announcements_.

 

(a) In addition to the terms, provisions and covenants of the Confidentiality
Agreement dated December 4, 2014, between the Buyer and Mallinckrodt LLC (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms, the Buyer acknowledges that, in the course of
its investigations of the Business, the Buyer and its representatives have
and will become aware of confidential information and documents related to the
Business and the other businesses of the Share Sellers and their Affiliates,
and that its use of such confidential information and documents,
or communication of such information to third parties, could be detrimental
to the Business or to the other businesses of the Share Sellers and their
Affiliates. The Buyer covenants that prior to Closing or in the event that
Closing does not occur, all information and documents reviewed by the Buyer
or its representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, following either Closing or termination of this
Agreement, all such information and documents to the extent related to any of
the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities and any confidential
information known to the Buyer (including through any Transferred Employee)
with respect to other businesses operated by the Share Sellers or any
of their Affiliates, shall, for a period of three (3) years following the
Closing Date, be maintained in confidence and shall not be disclosed or used
by the Buyer or its representatives without the Share Sellers prior written
consent, unless the Buyer can demonstrate that such information (i) is
otherwise publicly available, (ii) is required to be disclosed pursuant to
judicial order, regulation or Law, (iii) is required to be disclosed by the
rules of a securities exchange on which the Buyer may from time to time be
listed, or (iv) was already in the possession of the Buyer or its Affiliates
prior to or independently of disclosure hereunder without breach of any
obligation owed to a third party with respect to such information. With
respect to information and documents related to the Business, at the Share
Sellers request in the event that the Closing shall not occur, and, at the
Share Sellers request at any time with respect to information and documents
related to the Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities or other businesses
operated by the Share Sellers or any of their Affiliates, the Buyer shall, and
shall cause its representatives to, promptly destroy all information and
documents concerning (as applicable) the Business, the Excluded Assets, the
Excluded Liabilities or other businesses operated by the Share Sellers or any
of their Affiliates, as the case may be (including any copies thereof
or extracts therefrom). In the event that the Buyer or any of its
representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any information or
documents that are subject to any non-disclosure obligation set forth in this
Section 6.5(a), the Buyer shall provide the Share Sellers with prompt written
notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable the Share Sellers either
to seek a protective order, at their expense, or other appropriate remedy
preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance (in whole or
in part) with the provisions of this Section 6.5. In addition to and in
furtherance of the foregoing, the Buyer shall use reasonable efforts, and at
the request and expense of the Share Sellers, to cooperate with the Share
Sellers in seeking to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy
preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information. In the event of
any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement, the former shall prevail in all cases.

 



63 (b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, the Share
Sellers shall maintain, and shall cause their Affiliates to maintain, in
confidence any information they may have in relation to the Business, other
than with respect to the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities, and
such information shall not be disclosed or used by the Share Sellers or their
Affiliates without the Buyers prior written consent, unless they can
demonstrate such information (i) is otherwise publicly available, (ii) is
required to be disclosed pursuant to judicial order, regulation or Law, or
(iii) is required to be disclosed by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.

(c) Neither Party nor any of its Affiliates shall make any public
announcement at any time concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein without the prior written approval of the other Party
(which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld) and without giving the
other Party a meaningful opportunity (as practicable under the circumstances)
to review and comment on any such proposed public announcement.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event either Party
reasonably determines that any such public announcement is required by Law,
such Party shall give the other Party advance written notice of, and a
meaningful opportunity (as practicable under the circumstances) to review and
comment on, the proposed form and substance of any such announcement. The
Party whose proposed announcement is the subject of review shall consider
carefully and in good faith all comments timely received from the other Party,
but nothing shall interfere with the right of any Party making any public
announcement from making the final determination as to the form and nature of
any public disclosure it feels is legally required. The Parties do plan to
issue a press release (either independently or jointly) promptly after
the execution of this Agreement, and in that regard each Party has reviewed
and commented on the other Partys proposed press release in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this Section 6.5(c).

 

(d) Each Party acknowledges that any breach by it of the confidentiality
obligations set forth in this Section 6.5 may cause the other Party
irreparable harm for which compensation by monetary damages would be
inadequate and, therefore, the Party that has been harmed by any such breach
shall have the right to seek an injunction or decree for specific performance
and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach and
each of the Parties further agrees to waive any requirement for the security
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. Such remedy shall not
be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement but shall
be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to each of the
Parties.

 

6.6 _Cooperation_. On or after the Closing Date, the Parties shall, on
request, cooperate with one another by furnishing any additional information,
executing and delivering any additional documents and instruments, including
contract assignments, and doing any and all such other things as may be
reasonably required by the Parties or their counsel to consummate or
otherwise implement the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. In connection with the Excluded Liabilities and Excluded
Assets, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and employees to use
its reasonable best efforts to aid, cooperate with and assist Share Sellers
(at the Share Sellers cost and expense) in their defense of and access to
such liabilities and assets, and by providing the Share Sellers and their
Affiliates with reasonable access during normal business hours to pertinent
records at such times as such other party or parties may reasonably request.

 



64 6.7 _Competition Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing or pre-
filing where required as the case may be, in consultation with the other Party
and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all
documents necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, approvals and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority in order to consummate the transactions contemplated herein ("
_Competition Filings_ ") and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary to
obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, authorizations and approvals. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Party agrees to cause its ultimate parent entity make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated herein (" _HSR Filing_ ") as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
the date hereof (unless a later date is mutually agreed between the Parties),
and to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested in connection with
the HSR Filing and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act with
respect to the contemplated transaction as soon as reasonably practicable.
Also in furtherance of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make, as soon as
reasonably practicable, but no later than thirty (30) Business Days after the
date hereof (unless a later date is mutually agreed between the Parties or
unless an earlier date is required by applicable Laws) such other appropriate
Competition Filings with respect to jurisdictions outside the United States as
are reasonably necessary under any applicable Laws regarding competitive or
antitrust matters or relating to the control or approval of mergers or other
business combinations as may be in effect in any applicable jurisdiction
(together with the HSR Act, " _Competition Laws_ ") to obtain all waiting
period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
authorizations and approvals required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, and to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested in
connection with any such Competition Filing, and to take all other actions
necessary to cause any approval or clearance to be obtained in connection with
any such Competition Filing as soon as practicable.

 

(b) Each Party shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
6.7(a), (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other Party in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, including by allowing counsel for the other Parties to have a
reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings
and submissions, (ii) promptly inform counsel for the other Parties of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Authority, by
promptly providing copies to counsel for the other Parties of any such
written 

 



65  communications, and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that materials may be redacted as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns, (iii) permit counsel for the other Parties to review
in advance any communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the
DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority, or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other person ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that materials may be redacted as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns) and (iv) to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC
or any other applicable Governmental Authority or other person, give counsel
for the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-
person meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Authority or other person.
In furtherance of the covenants of the Parties contained in Section 6.7(a)
and this Section 6.7(b), each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein under any Competition Law including agreeing
to any terms, conditions or modifications (including the Buyer, the Share
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates having to cease operating,
licensing, selling or otherwise disposing of any assets or businesses
(including the requirement that any such assets or businesses be held
separate)) with respect to obtaining the expiration or termination of any
waiting period or any consents, clearances, waivers, approvals or
authorizations in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein; _provided_ , however, that the Share Sellers shall not be
required to take such actions under this Section 6.7(b) that would result in,
or would be reasonably likely to result in, either individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Share Sellers and their other
businesses. Nothing in this Section 6.7(b) shall require a Party or its
Affiliates to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business
or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing. The Buyer shall, on behalf of the Parties,
control and lead all communications and strategy relating to the Competition
Laws in consultation with the Share Sellers; _provided_ , that, the Share
Sellers are not constrained from complying with applicable Law, and provided,
further, that counsel for the Parties shall consult and cooperate with
one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another regarding
the form and content of any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any Party in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Competition
Law or Competition Filing prior to their submission.

(c) Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the expiration
or termination of all waiting periods and all consents, waivers,
authorizations and approvals of all Governmental Authorities, necessary,
proper or advisable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein; provided, that, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, the
Share Sellers and their Affiliates shall not incur any significant expense or
liability, enter into any significant new commitment or agreement or agree to
any significant modification to any contractual arrangement, in each case with
respect to the Business, to obtain such consents or approvals that would have
a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.7 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Buyer or any of its respective Affiliates
shall not be required to agree to the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to

 



66  conduct their respective businesses or the business of the Share Sellers
that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, either
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Buyer,
taken as a whole. Nothing in this Section 6.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall require Buyer or any other Party or any of their respective Affiliates
to litigate with any third party, including without limitation, any
Governmental Authority or private party.

(e) The Buyer shall not (and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to)
enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction
involving any merger or acquisition of shares or assets of any entity engaged
in a business which is directly competitive with the Business that might
reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time
required, to (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act, or in connection with any other Competition Filing,
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) avoid the
entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, waivers, and
approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.8 _Covenant Not to Compete_.

 

(a) For the period ending on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing
Date and anywhere in the world, none of the Share Sellers nor any of their
Affiliates shall engage in any activities that are directly competitive with
the Business (as conducted by the Share Sellers and their Affiliates on and as
of the date hereof) (" _Competitive Activities_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer hereby agrees that the covenant set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence shall not be deemed to prohibit any of the
following: (i) the Share Sellers or their Affiliates providing services to
the Buyer or its Affiliates under or participating in any other arrangement
contemplated by of the Transition Services Agreement, (ii) the ownership or
acquisition by the Share Sellers or any of their Affiliates of any firm,
person or entity which engages, directly or indirectly, in Competitive
Activities if such Competitive Activities account for less than twenty five
percent (25%) of such persons consolidated annual revenues in any given
calendar year, (iii) the Share Sellers or their Affiliates engaging in any
business (other than the Business) in which the Share Sellers or their
Affiliates are currently engaged, whether or not any one or more products or
services associated with such business activities might be deemed to be
competitive in some manner with the Competitive Activities, (iv) manufacturing
and supplying to third parties raw materials, active pharmaceutical
ingredients or intermediate compounds (but not finished products ready for
distribution and sale and intended for use in connection with the diagnosis of
human ailments) whether or not any of the foregoing are used by such third
party in connection with Competitive Activities and (v) the acquisition by
the Share Sellers or their Affiliates of rights to any product (whether by
purchase, license or otherwise) that may be used for Competitive Activities,
as long as either such product is not so employed or is a product that falls
within the exception set forth in clause (ii) of this sentence as if any such
product was an acquired entity or person for purposes of such clause (ii).

 

(b) Without limiting the remedies available, the Parties agree that damages at
law would be an insufficient remedy in the event of breach of this Section
6.8 by the Share Sellers or their Affiliates and that the Buyer shall be
entitled to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the event of
any such breach.

 



67 (c) If any of the provisions of this Section 6.8 are held to be unenforceable
in any jurisdiction, then, as to such jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of its unenforceability in such jurisdiction,
without affecting the remaining provisions of this Section 6.8 in such
jurisdiction, or affecting in any other jurisdiction the validity or
enforceability of such provision or of this Section 6.8.

6.9 _Use of the Seller Marks and Seller UPC Codes_.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.9, the Share Sellers
hereby grant a limited, non-exclusive, fully paid, non-royalty bearing right
and license to the Buyer for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the
Closing Date to use the Seller Marks only to the extent necessary to allow the
Buyer and/or its designated Affiliates to market, distribute, and sell
product Inventory included in the Business Assets and any products purchased
from the Share Sellers or their Affiliates from and after the Closing Date,
utilizing the labels and packaging, advertising, marketing, sales and
promotional materials, in each case, existing on the Closing Date and included
in the Business Assets or, with respect to products purchased from the Share
Sellers or their Affiliates, packaging in which such products are sold to the
Buyer.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.9, the Share Sellers
hereby grant a limited, non-exclusive, fully-paid, non-royalty bearing right
and license to the Buyer for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the
Closing Date to use the Seller UPC Codes only to the extent necessary to allow
the Buyer and/or its designated Affiliates to market, distribute, and sell
product Inventory included in the Business Assets and any products purchased
from the Share Sellers from and after the Closing Date, utilizing the labels
and packaging, advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials, in
each case, existing on the Closing Date and included in the Business Assets
or, with respect to products purchased from the Share Sellers or their
Affiliates, packaging in which such products are sold to the Buyer.

 

(c) Promptly upon the expiration of the period set forth in Section 6.9(a) and
6.9(b), the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, where practical
and compliant with applicable Laws, over-label any use of Seller Marks or
Seller UPC Codes on product labels and advertising, marketing, sales and
promotional materials in its possession or under its control and, where
the foregoing is not practical or is legally impossible, the Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, destroy and dispose of all labels and all
advertising, marketing, sales and promotional materials, in its possession or
subject to its control, bearing any of the Seller Marks or Seller UPC Codes;
_provided, however_ , the twenty-four (24) month-period specified in Sections
6.9(a) and 6.9(b) shall not, after the end of such period, restrict the Buyer
and its Affiliates from selling products acquired from the Share Sellers or
their Affiliates, using the packaging in which such Inventory or products were
acquired (even if such packaging bears one or more of the Seller Marks).
Notwithstanding the preceding portions of this Section 6.9(c), absolutely no
use of any of the Seller Marks or Seller UPC Codes by the Buyer or its
Affiliates will be permitted for any reason after the second (2nd) anniversary
from and after the Closing Date, except and to the extent explicitly required
under and pursuant to any applicable terms of the Transition Services
Agreement.

 



68 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 6.9, in no event shall the
Buyer or any of its designated Affiliates (i) use any Seller Marks or Seller
UPC Codes in any manner, for any purpose, or in connection with any products
different from the use of such Seller Marks or Seller UPC Codes by the Share
Sellers and their Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii)
manufacture or produce, or cause or permit any third party to manufacture or
produce, any new labels, packaging or advertising, marketing, sales and
promotional materials using or otherwise incorporating any Seller Marks,
other than packaging for products purchased from the Share Sellers or their
Affiliates, or (iii) manufacture or produce, or cause or permit any third
party to manufacture or produce, any new labels, packaging or advertising,
marketing, sales and promotional materials using or otherwise incorporating
any Seller UPC Codes. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will take
any action or omit to take any action that might reasonably cause any of the
Seller Marks to be disparaged or that might reasonably diminish the value of
the goodwill associated with the Share Seller Marks (which the Buyer
acknowledges will accrue solely to the benefit of the Share Sellers and their
Affiliates) or that might reasonably interfere in any manner with the use by
the Share Sellers or their Affiliates of the Seller Marks.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that this
Agreement does not, and shall not, convey, transfer or assign any right, title
or interest in any trademark, name, or logo of any third party.

 

(f) Within three (3) months after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall (i) remove
all Seller Marks from all websites or website content included in the
Business Assets and (ii) disable all links in any such website to websites
maintained by the Share Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

 

6.10 _The Share Sellers  Guarantees_. The Buyer shall use its best efforts as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date to obtain the
complete release and discharge of the Share Sellers and their Affiliates from
all the obligations (including any obligations upon any renewal or extension)
and related to the Business on which the Share Sellers or any of
their Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Indirect
Subsidiaries) are directly or contingently obligated as guarantors or
otherwise contingently liable (including any guarantees with respect to
workers compensation liabilities, staywell letters or letters of
indemnification and guarantees of financing), except for any such obligations
included in the Excluded Liabilities. In the event that the Buyer is unable to
obtain any such release, the Buyer agrees that (i) the term of any such
obligation shall not be extended and no such obligation shall otherwise be
modified in a manner which would expand the financial exposure of the Share
Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries or
the Indirect Subsidiaries), (ii) it shall use its best efforts to substitute
itself or an Affiliate as primary guarantor of such obligations, and (iii) it
shall obtain a letter of credit for the benefit of the Share Sellers in an
amount equal to the aggregate principal and interest payable under such
obligations, plus a reasonable estimate of enforcement expenses for which the
Share Sellers would be liable (" _Letter of Credit_ "). Such Letter of Credit
shall be issued by a bank rated at B or better by Thomson Bankwatch, and
shall continue for such period as such obligations remain outstanding.

 



69 6.11 _Insurance Policies_. Buyer acknowledges that none of the insurance
policies and other insurance coverage relative to the Business, the Business
Assets and the Employees carried by the Share Sellers and their Affiliates on
and as of the date hereof (and on and as of the Closing) will be transferred
to the Buyer or its Affiliates (including to the Transferred Subsidiaries or
Indirect Subsidiaries to be acquired hereunder) on and as of and as a
consequence of the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereunder but,
rather, except for any tail or extended coverages existing solely for the
benefit of the Share Sellers and their Affiliates covering acts or omissions
to act occurring prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled by the Share
Sellers and their Affiliates on and as of the Effective Time, and the cost
or benefit associated with any such cancellations shall be entirely for the
account of the Share Seller and their Affiliates. Thus, it shall be the
obligation and responsibility of the Buyer or its Affiliates, from and after
the Closing Date, to provide insurance coverage for the Business Assets, the
Transferred Subsidiaries, and the Indirect Subsidiaries and with respect to
all Employees and Transferred Employees as it shall deem necessary and
appropriate under the circumstances. Each Share Seller retain all rights to
control its and their respective Affiliates insurance policies and programs,
including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or
otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and
programs, notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs apply to any
liabilities of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 

6.12 _Covidien Trademark License_. Mallinckrodt US shall cause Mallinckrodt
LLC to assign to Buyer Mallinckrodt LLCs rights and obligations under that
certain License Agreement for "Covidien" Trademarks (Pharmaceuticals
Separation) dated June 28, 2013 (the " _Covidien Trademark License Agreement_
") to use the Licensed Covidien Marks solely in connection with the imaging
products business field (specifically, imaging products and related services)
(the " _Assigned Covidien License Rights_ "). Buyers exercise of the Assigned
Covidien License Rights shall be limited by and subject in all respects to
Buyers compliance with all terms and conditions of the Covidien Trademark
License Agreement applicable to Mallinckrodt LLC thereunder in respect of the
Assigned Covidien License Rights and Buyers performance of all obligations
ascribed to Mallinckrodt LLC under the Covidien Trademark License Agreement in
respect of the Assigned Covidien License Rights. For the avoidance of doubt,
Mallinckrodt LLC shall retain all of its rights under the Covidien Trademark
License Agreement not assigned to Buyer.

6.13 _Local Transfer Documents_

 

(a) On Closing, the Share Sellers and the Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall
execute such agreements, transfers, and other documents (subject to the
relevant local Law and otherwise as may be agreed between the Share Sellers
and the Buyer) to implement the transfer of the Shares (the " _Local Transfer
Documents_ ").

 

(b) To the extent that the provisions of a Local Transfer Document are
inconsistent with or (except to the extent they implement a transfer in
accordance with this Agreement) additional to the provisions of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail in the event of any
conflict or inconsistency.

 



70 (c) If there is an adjustment to the payment made on account of the Estimated
Purchase Price under Section 2.4 of this Agreement as a consequence of the
execution and delivery of a Local Transfer Document, then, if required to
implement the adjustment and so far as permissible under the Laws of the
relevant jurisdiction, the relevant Share Seller(s) and the Buyer shall enter
into a supplemental agreement reflecting such adjustment and the allocation of
such adjustment.

 

6.14 _Manufacturing and Know How Transfer Agreement_. No later than on the
Closing Date, the Parties shall sign a manufacturing and know-how transfer
agreement, which will provide for a technology transfer of the manufacturing
technology and know-how employed pursuant to the MP-104 Toll Manufacturing
Agreement, to be effective at the Closing between Mallinckrodt
Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited and the Buyer or its Affiliates under the
conditions set forth on _Schedule 6.14_.

6.15 _Kirkland Facility_. The Share Sellers hereby agree that they shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer in respect of any decommissioning costs
and expenses associated with the Kirkland Facility.

 

6.16 _Appointment of Directors_. Prior to or at the Closing, the Share Sellers
shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries and Indirect Subsidiaries to appoint
such persons as the Buyer has nominated as directors of the Transferred
Subsidiaries and Indirect Subsidiaries, effective immediately following the
Closing (whose names shall be communicated by the Buyer to the Share
Sellers at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date).

6.17 _Toll Manufacturing Agreement for Versetamide Product_. Prior to or
at the Closing, the Parties shall sign a Toll Manufacturing Agreement for
Versetamide Product to be effective at the Closing on the terms set forth on
_Schedule 6.17_.

 

6.18 _Back-Up Toll Manufacturing Agreement for Ioversol Product Amendment_.
Prior to or at the Closing, the Parties shall sign an amendment to the Back-
Up Toll Manufacturing Agreement for Ioversol Product to be effective at the
Closing on the terms set forth on _Schedule 6.18_.

the satisfaction, on or prior to the Closing Date, of each of the following
conditions precedent, any of which may be waived in whole or in part by the
Buyer by written notice to the Share Sellers:

 

7.1 _Accuracy of Representations and Warranties and Performance of
Obligations_. All representations and warranties made by the Share Sellers in
this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects on and as of the
Closing Date with the same effect as if such representations and warranties

such representation or warranty by its terms relates to an earlier date, and
(ii) except to the extent of any change permitted by the terms of this
Agreement or consented to by the Buyer, and (iii) except for breaches of such
representations and warranties that would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
_provided that_ paragraph (iii) above will not limit the right for the

 



71  Buyer or its Affiliates to be indemnified under Article 9 and will not apply
to Perpetual Representations. The Share Sellers shall have performed or
complied in all material respects with all covenants, agreements and
conditions contained in this Agreement on their part required to be performed

to the Buyer at the Closing a certificate of an authorized officer of each of
the Share Sellers certifying that the conditions stated in this Section 7.1
have been fulfilled.

7.2 _Consents and Approvals_. All Competition Filings required hereunder

(i) any amounts required to be paid by the Transferred Subsidiaries or

(p) any obligations or liabilities for which Mallinckrodt Deutschland GmbH is

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the Share Sellers indemnify or be liable in any way for any
Losses arising out of or resulting from any suits, actions, judgements
settlements, orders, writs, injunctions, decrees or any other Proceedings to
the extent related to the Business and/or the Transferred Subsidiaries and/or
any of the Indirect Subsidiaries that are filed or of which Buyer or its
Affiliates are notified, formally or in writing, after the Closing Date,
whether or not they arise out of acts or omissions to act by either Party or
their Affiliates before or after the Closing Date, other than for such Losses
indemnifiable under any of paragraph (a) to (p) of Section 9.1 above.

 

9.2 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Article 9 and specifically to the indemnification obligations of Section

77 (d) relative to the Business, any Taxes reflected in the Closing Net Working
Capital or Closing Indebtedness, Taxes attributable to Post-Closing Periods
and the Buyers or its Affiliates portion of any liability for Taxes for any
Straddle Period, all of the foregoing as determined in accordance with Section
2.5 hereof, and

 

(e) any claim made by any Employee due to that Employees actual or
constructive termination of employment by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Indirect Subsidiaries) for any
reason and with respect to any such termination occurring after the Closing
Date.

 

9.3 _Notice and Payment of Losses_. Upon obtaining knowledge of any Loss, the
Party that believes it is entitled to indemnification (the " _Injured Party_
") shall promptly notify the Party who may be liable for such indemnification
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of such Loss which the Injured Party
has determined have given or could give rise to a claim under Section 9.1 or
9.2 (such written notice being hereinafter referred to as a " _Notice of
Claim_ "); _provided, however_ , that failure of an Injured Party timely to
give a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from its indemnity obligations set forth in this Article 9
except to the extent that such failure (i) materially adversely affects the
ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend such claim or (ii) increases the
amount of indemnification which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to pay
hereunder, and in the event clause (ii) of this sentence applies, the amount
of any indemnification which the Injured Party shall be entitled to receive
with respect to any given Notice of Claim shall be reduced to an amount which
the Injured Party would have been entitled to receive had such Notice of Claim
been timely given. If, prior to giving a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying
Party, the Injured Party settles or compromises any third party claims, or
initiates action which has the purpose or the effect, in whole or in part, of
causing a claim to be asserted, the Indemnifying Party shall be released from
its indemnity obligation. A Notice of Claim shall specify in reasonable
detail, to the extent known by the Injured Party, the nature and, to the
extent reasonably calculable, estimated amount of any such claim giving rise
to a right of indemnification. The Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its
obligation to make payment for any claim for indemnification under Section 9.1
or 9.2, as the case may be, within sixty (60) days of its receipt of a Notice
of Claim; _provided, however_ , that for so long as the Indemnifying Party is
either (x) with respect to any Notice of Claim disputing its responsibility to
indemnify the other Party or disputing the amount of any claim for
indemnification or (y) with respect to any Notice of Claim that involves a
third-party claim, defending a third-party claim in good faith pursuant to
Section 9.4, the Indemnifying Partys obligations to make payment to the
Injured Party with respect thereto shall be suspended until either, with
respect to clause (x) of this sentence, the Indemnifying Party has accepted
responsibility for indemnification and has agreed upon the amount of such
indemnification or, with respect to both clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence
(as applicable), a final unappealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction is given in relation to such claim. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Section 9.3, if a third party has unequivocally
and in writing offered to settle a third-party claim on a basis consistent
with the requirements of the preceding sentences of this Section 9.3 and for
the payment of a definite amount, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to settle such claim without receiving the consent of the Injured
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) Business Days (or such
shorter period of time that the Injured Party may be required to respond to
any suit or governmental action) after receipt of a Notice of Claim to notify
the Injured Party (A) whether or not it disputes

 



78  its obligation to indemnify the Injured Party with respect to such Notice of
Claim and (B) whether it elects to defend any third-party claim that forms the
basis for any such Notice of Claim pursuant to Section 9.4.

9.4 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_. With respect to any action or any claim
set forth in a Notice of Claim relating to a third-party claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its expense, any such
claim or demand, and the Injured Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate (but not control), at its expense, in the defense
of any such third-party claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails timely to
notify the Injured Party of its election to defend any third-party claim, the
Injured Party shall, upon written notice to the Indemnifying Party, have the
right to undertake the defense or settlement of such claim for the account and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of such claim at any time prior to settlement or
final determination thereof, but only if such assumption would not materially
prejudice the defense of such claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party is
defending any such third-party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the written consent of the Injured Party (which shall not
unreasonably be withheld), settle or compromise any third-party claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include an unconditional
release from liability in respect of the Injured Party or which does include
any terms or conditions that might restrict or limit the conduct of business
by the Injured Party. If such claim is settled by the Injured Party without
the Indemnifying Partys consent, the Injured Party shall be deemed to
have waived all rights hereunder for indemnification arising out of such
claim. The Injured Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party or its
representatives all records and other materials reasonably required for use in
contesting any third-party claim. The Injured Party shall cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of all such claims. Notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, the Indemnifying Party will not be responsible for
any Losses if and to the extent that they arise from action taken or omitted
to be taken by the Injured Party in bad faith, fraudulently, negligently or as
a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Injured Party. With respect to
any third-party claims that are Proceedings with respect to the Business that
are outstanding as of the Closing Date and for which the Share Sellers have
the obligation to indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates hereunder, the Share
Sellers and their Affiliates shall continue with the defense of such third-
party claims after the Closing Date in a manner consistent with the defense of
such claims on or prior to the Closing Date, and otherwise in a manner
consistent with this Section 9.4, and the Buyer and its Affiliates shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to participate (but not control), at their
expense, in the defense of such Proceedings. In the event of any conflict
between this Section 9.4 and Section 2.5, Section 2.5 shall control.

 

9.5 _Environmental Claims Procedures_.

 

(a) With respect to (i) any matters covered by any Notice of Claim sent by the
Buyer after the Closing Date and relating to any liability under any
Environmental Laws or (ii) any issues outstanding and known as of the Closing
Date that relate to any liability under any Environmental Laws (which are set
forth and described on _Schedule 9.1(g)_ attached hereto) for which the Share
Sellers are liable to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates pursuant to Section
9.1(g) above (" _Environmental Indemnity Matters_ "), the Share Sellers and
their Affiliates shall assume overall primary management and control of such
matters, (A) immediately after the Closing Date with respect to any matters
that involve ongoing characterization, remediation,

 



79  monitoring or other similar activities and are outstanding as of the Closing
Date and (B) with respect to any matter of which the Share Sellers receive any
timely Notice of Claim from the Buyer after the Closing Date, from and after
the date upon which the Share Sellers accept responsibility to indemnify the
Buyer with respect to such Environmental Indemnity Matter as determined in
accordance with this Section 9.5. In the event that any Notice of Claim
relates to any third party action of which the Buyer has been notified, and in
addition to any procedures set forth in this Section 9.5, such third-party
claim will be handled in a manner consistent with Section 9.4 above;
_provided, that_ , in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the
provisions of Section 9.4 and this Section 9.5, Section 9.5 shall prevail,
absent specific written agreement of the Parties to the contrary.

(b) Except for issues outstanding and known as of the Closing Date (which are
set forth and described on  _Schedule 9.1(g)_ attached hereto) the Share
Sellers responsibility to indemnify the Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Indemnity Matter is conditioned upon the Buyer giving the Share
Sellers a prior written Notice of Claim of any remedial, corrective or
similar action proposed by any relevant Governmental Authority ("
_Environmental Action_ ") that might give rise to a claim by the Buyer for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(g) hereof, which notice shall be in
reasonable detail, shall be given in accordance with the claim period
limitations set forth in Section 9.6(c) and shall be provided promptly after
Buyer or any of its Affiliates become aware of any Environmental Action
(but no later than fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter); _provided,
however_ , that failure of Buyer timely to give such Notice of Claim to Share
Sellers shall not release Share Sellers from their indemnity obligations set
forth in this Article 9 except to the extent that such failure (i) materially
adversely affects the ability of the Share Seller to defend such claim or (ii)
increases the amount of indemnification which the Share Sellers are obligated
to pay, and in the event clause (ii) of this sentence applies, the amount of
any indemnification which the Buyer shall be entitled to receive with respect
to any given Notice of Claim shall be reduced to an amount which the Buyer
would have been entitled to receive had such Notice of Claim been timely
given. Although the Share Sellers shall have the right at Share Sellers sole
discretion to manage any Environmental Indemnity Matter or Environmental
Action, the Buyer shall be kept informed of all significant events occurring
and actions taken with respect thereto and the Buyer shall have the right to
prior approval with respect to any action proposed to be taken by the Share
Sellers with respect to any such Environmental Indemnity Matter
or Environmental Action if such action might reasonably interfere in any
material way with the business activities of the Buyer or its Affiliates at
any owned or leased site or might reasonably cause the Buyer or its Affiliates
to take any actions that might require the significant expenditure of funds
or incremental utilization of resources. If the Buyer refuses unreasonably to
consent to any action that the Share Sellers deem reasonably necessary in
connection with any Environmental Indemnity Matter or Environmental Action,
and such unreasonable refusal to consent materially adversely affects the
Share Sellers in performing any remediation, corrective or similar action
(including, without limitation, increasing significantly the expense of any
actions to be taken), then the Share Sellers will no longer have any
obligation to indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates solely with respect to
such Environmental Indemnity Matter. The Buyer agrees to grant reasonable
access to the Share Sellers and their Affiliates (and its and their
representatives) to the Buyers and its Affiliates facilities during normal
working hours to allow the Share Sellers to discharge their obligations under
this Section 9.5, pursuant to a commercially reasonable access agreement to
be entered into by the Share Sellers and the Buyer. The Share Sellers agree
(on behalf of themselves, their Affiliates, and its and their representatives)
to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid any disruption to the Buyers
and its Affiliates business activities in performing its obligations
hereunder.

 



80 (c) At the time when the Buyer delivers a Notice of Claim to the Share Sellers
with respect to an Environmental Indemnity Matter, the Buyer agrees to
provide to the Share Sellers and their Affiliates such documents and other
data and information the Buyer has available that relate to evolution of the
claim subsequent to the Closing Date, subject to both the Buyer and the Share
Sellers taking whatever actions are reasonably necessary to avoid the loss or
waiver of any privilege the Buyer may have against disclosure of any such
documents, data or information to any third party whose position may
reasonably be considered adverse to the Buyer.

(d) The Share Sellers will, in connection with any Environmental Action,
be entitled to utilize the most cost-effective methods and technologies
applicable to perform any remediation, corrective action or similar actions
that still meet the standards of applicable Environmental Law, provided the
use of such methods and technologies will not limit in any material way
Buyers ability to continue to operate its facilities or deal with its
properties in the same manner as such facilities or properties are being
operated or used at the time Share Sellers implement such methods and
technologies. The Share Sellers shall not be responsible to indemnify the
Buyer for the incremental cost of remediation, corrective or similar actions
that are more restrictive or onerous than those required under
Environmental Laws. If the Buyer, without the Share Sellers prior written
permission, elects to perform any remediation, corrective or similar actions
relative to any Environmental Action (whether or not in a manner more
restrictive or more onerous than the standard set forth in the first sentence
of this Section 9.5(d) in any given case), it may do so (provided such
election does not materially interfere with the performance by the Share
Sellers of any of their obligations hereunder), but the costs and expenses
attributable to that portion of any such Environmental Action accomplished by
the Buyer shall not be subject to indemnification by the Share Sellers
hereunder.

 

(e) To the extent there is a dispute between the Parties over whether, with
respect to any site or sites which are the subject of an Environmental
Action, any action taken by the Share Sellers or their Affiliates (or its or
their representatives) meets the standard set forth in Section 9.5(d) above or
is otherwise inconsistent with Environmental Laws, the Parties shall in good
faith attempt to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days of the date any
such dispute arises (or at the end of such additional period as the parties
shall mutually agree in writing) and, upon failing to do so, the Parties
shall promptly select (each time such a dispute arises) an independent third
party and mutually acceptable environmental consultant (" _Third Party
Consultant_ ") who shall, on the basis of whatever scientific, legal or other
information the Buyer and the Share Sellers shall individually choose to
submit to the Third Party Consultant for consideration, determine which
Partys position is correct with respect to each element of any dispute. The
decision of the Third Party Consultant as contemplated hereunder shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The costs and expenses of the Third Party
Consultant in acting pursuant to this Section 9.5(e) shall be borne equally by
the Buyer and the Share Sellers. The Buyer and the Share Sellers shall not be
required on any occasion to select any firm to act as Third Party Consultant
hereunder that has previously acted in such capacity in accordance herewith.

 



81 9.6 _Survival and Claim Periods_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 and Article 4
hereof shall survive the Closing Date until the end of the day that is the
eighteen (18) month anniversary thereof, except that (i) the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.9(a), 3.10(a) (second

9.1(b) or 9.2(b) (as applicable) for breach of any representation or warranty
that is not a Perpetual Representation must be made within thirty (30) days
after the expiration of any survival period applicable to such representation
and warranty or no claim for indemnification for such breach will be
available hereunder.

(b) No claim by the Buyer for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.1(a), Section
9.1(e), Section 9.1(o) or Section 9.1(p), or by the Share Sellers pursuant to
Sections 9.2(a) or 9.2(d) shall be effective unless a Notice of Claim with
respect to an indemnifiable matter thereunder is given by the Buyer or the
Share Sellers (as applicable) in accordance herewith prior to the end of any
applicable statute of limitations with respect to such Loss.

(c) Other than with respect to those matters set forth on _Schedule 9.1(g)_ ,
no claim by the Buyer for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.1(g) shall be
effective unless a Notice of Claim with respect to an indemnifiable matter
thereunder is given by the Buyer in accordance herewith within thirty (30)
days after the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

(d) No claim for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.1(h) or Section 9.2(e) shall

months after the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) thirty
(30) days after the date on which the Injured Party first become aware of any
indemnifiable matter.

 

(e) A Notice of Claim may be filed at any time after the Closing Date by the
Share Sellers with respect to any indemnifiable matter pursuant to Sections
9.2(c), _provided, that_ , any Notice of Claim with respect to an
indemnifiable matter thereunder is filed within sixty (60) days after the date
on which the Share Sellers first become aware of any indemnifiable matter.

 

(f) A Notice of Claim may be filed at any time after the Closing Date by the
Buyer with respect to any indemnifiable matter pursuant to Sections 9.1(c),
9.1(d), 9.1(i) 9.1(k), 9.1(m), or 9.1(n), and by either Party with respect to
any breach by the other Party of any of the Perpetual Representations.

 

(g) No claim by the Buyer for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.1(j), shall be
effective unless a Notice of Claim with respect to an indemnifiable matter
thereunder is given by the Buyer in accordance herewith within thirty (30)
days after the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



82 (h) No claim by the Buyer for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.1(f) or Section
9.1(l) shall be effective unless a Notice of Claim with respect to an
indemnifiable matter thereunder is given by the Buyer in accordance herewith
within thirty (30) days after the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing
Date.

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, a Notice of Claim
may be filed at any time after the Closing Date by either party with respect
to any liability or claim arising as a result of fraud or neglect in the
performance by either party of any obligation, action or omission to act in
connection with Section 2.5 hereunder.

(j) On and as of the Closing Date, the Buyer will be deemed automatically to
have filed a Notice of Claim with respect to any indemnifiable matters covered
by the indemnity set forth in Section 9.1(f) and only with respect to those
matters set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.8_ or any indemnifiable
matters covered by the indemnity set forth in Section 9.1(g) and only with
respect to those matters that are set forth on _Schedule 9.1(g)_.

 

(k) Any Notice of Claim filed by either Party hereunder that is timely and
otherwise meets the requirements hereof shall survive until it is fully

9.7 _Certain Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.1(a) for any breach of the covenants by the Share Sellers set forth in
Section 2.5, and neither Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any
breach of the representations and warranties pursuant to Sections 9.1(b) or
9.2(b) (as applicable) or Section 9.1(j), except for Losses with respect to
all of the foregoing to the extent in excess of Two Million U.S. Dollars
(US$2,000,000) considered in the aggregate (the " _Deductible_ "); provided,
that, the foregoing Deductible shall not apply with respect to any Notices of
Claim filed for indemnification with respect to (i) any breach by either Party
of any of the Perpetual Representations, (ii) Section 9.1.(a) (other
than Section 2.5), Section 3.7 _(Taxes)_ or Section 3.18 ( _Environmental
Matters_ ) and (iii) Section 9.1(c), Section 9.1(d), Section 9.1(e), Section
9.1(f), Section 9.1(g), Section 9.1(h), Section 9.1(i), Section 9.1(k),
Section 9.1(l), Section 9.1(m), Section 9.1(n), Section 9.1(o) or Section
9.1(p).

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
the liability of the Share Sellers and their Affiliates for Losses pursuant
to (i) Section 9.1(a), (ii) Section 9.1(b) (except with respect to the
Perpetual Representations and the representations set forth in Section 3.7 (
_Taxes_ )), (iii) Section 9.1(f), (iv) Section 9.1(g), (v) Section 9.1(j),
(vi) 9.1(m) and (vii) 9.1(n) exceed 12.5% of the Final Purchase Price.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
the liability of the Buyer for Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a) and Section
9.2(b) exceed 12.5% of the Final Purchase Price.

 



83 (d) Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to indemnification for
Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(a) for any breach of the covenants by the
Share Sellers set forth in Section 2.5, Section 9.1(b) for any breach of the
representations and warranties by the Share Sellers, or Section 9.1(e) with
respect to any individual claim unless the Losses associated with such claim
exceed Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$10,000) (" _De Minimis Claim_ "). Any De
Minimis Claim shall count toward calculation of the Deductible.

 

(e) In no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any
consequential, special, exemplary or similar damages (including damages
for lost profits or business interruption), whether or not a Party has been
advised of the possibility of such damages and whether or not they are
reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances; _provided, that_
notwithstanding the immediately foregoing and subject to any other
limitations set forth herein, an Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for
such type of damages if and to the extent awarded in connection with or as
part of any judgment, order, decree or other final resolution by a court or
other tribunal in connection with a third-party claim for which
indemnification is otherwise available in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(f) All indemnification obligations shall be paid in U.S. Dollars in the
United States.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no liability,
obligation, Contract or other matter shall constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Share Sellers or entitle the Buyer to
indemnification hereunder to the extent that such liability, obligation,
Contract or other matter was provided for in the Closing Net Working, Capital,
Closing Indebtedness or in the Closing Net Cash.

(h) If an adjustment of an item of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit
that gives rise to an indemnified Loss pursuant to Section 9.1(a) for any
breach of the covenants by the Share Sellers set forth in Section 2.5 (Taxes),
Section 9.1(b) for any breach of the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 3.7 (Taxes), or the covenants in Section 9.1(e) results in (i)
increased deductions, losses or credits, or (ii) decreases in income, gains or
amount of recaptured Tax credits, or other Tax benefits ("Tax Benefits") to
Buyer, the Transferred Subsidiaries or Indirect Subsidiaries in each Post-
Closing Period that begins prior to five (5) years after the day after the
Closing Date or portion of a Straddle Period after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall pay to the Share Sellers the amount of the Tax Savings produced by such
Tax Benefits. For purposes of this Section 9.7(h), "Tax Savings" means an
amount by which the Tax liability of a person (or group of corporations
including the person) is reduced as a result of such Tax Benefit. Any
payments made pursuant to this Section 9.7(h) shall be treated as a reduction
in the amount of the initial indemnity payment. Buyers calculation of any Tax
Benefit or Tax Savings shall be presumed correct absent manifest error,
provided, however, upon written request by the Share Sellers, Buyer shall
provide an explanation and calculation of any Tax Benefit or Tax Savings.
Buyer and the Share Sellers shall, in good faith, seek to resolve
any differences that they may have with respect to the calculation of any Tax
Benefit or Tax Savings. The Share Sellers may, upon their written request,
require that Buyer engage the Expert to provide a calculation of any such Tax
Benefit or Tax Savings, whose fees shall be borne as provided in Section
2.4(b) and whose determination shall be final, conclusive and binding with
respect to the matters referred thereto. In the case of a transfer pricing
adjustment which could 

 



84  result in a corresponding or correlative adjustment in another Transferred
Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary, Buyer will use commercially reasonable
efforts to attain such corresponding or correlative adjustment to limit the
amount of any Loss before filing a claim for indemnification under the above
provisions. Furthermore, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to reduce or eliminate a transfer pricing secondary adjustment proposed by a
Taxing authority, including making payments between Share Sellers or one or
more of their Affiliates on the one hand, and the Transferred Subsidiaries or
Indirect Subsidiaries on the other hand, as a repatriation of funds, and
making an equal corresponding adjustment to Purchase Price in order to keep
the Parties whole and in the same economic position prior to such payment.

 

9.8 _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnification payments
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered, to the extent
permissible under Law, as adjustments to the Final Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes and adjustments to the Final Purchase Price allocable to the
applicable Transferred Subsidiary or Indirect Subsidiary.

 

9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to any violation of Section 6.8,
the sole and exclusive remedy of either Party for damages or other monetary
relief shall be the rights of indemnification hereunder, as set forth and as
limited in this Article 9; _provided, that_ , notwithstanding the immediately
foregoing, (i) each Party shall retain the right to pursue any claims in
equity that may be available with respect to the nonperformance or breach of
any obligation contemplated to be performed hereunder or under any document,
instrument or certificate to be delivered in connection herewith and (ii)
each Party shall further retain the right to receive monetary relief against
the other Party to redress any fraudulent action or other willful or
intentional wrongdoing related to the transactions contemplated herein.

 

ARTICLE 10 __

10.1  _Right to Terminate_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated
herein abandoned at any time prior to the Closing only as follows:

 

(i) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Share Sellers,

 

(ii) by either the Buyer or the Share Sellers if the Closing shall not have
occurred by the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this clause (ii) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation or satisfy any condition (to the extent within such
Partys reasonable control) under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date,

 

(iii) by either the Buyer or the Share Sellers if a court or Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable,

 



85 (iv) by the Share Sellers, if the Buyer fails to comply in any material
respect with any covenants or agreements contained herein and within twenty
(20) days after notice thereof from the Share Sellers is unable to cure such
breach, or

 

(v) by the Buyer, if the Share Sellers or any of their Affiliates fail to
comply in any material respect with any covenants or agreements contained
herein and within twenty (20) days after notice thereof from the Buyer are
unable to cure such breach.

10.2  _Obligations to Cease_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no further effect, and neither the Buyer nor the Share
Sellers (nor any of their directors, officers, employees and Affiliates)
shall be liable to any person in respect hereof or of the transactions
contemplated hereby except (i) for any liability resulting from any breach of
any agreement or covenant hereunder or (ii) any liability arising from any
termination of this Agreement which is not in accordance with its express
terms. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement for any reason.

 

10.3 _Termination of Ancillary Agreements_. The Parties hereto agree that they
will take all actions necessary so that they will not terminate, and none of
their respective Affiliates will terminate, any Ancillary Agreement (if any)
that is executed on the date hereof while this Agreement is still in force,
unless the Parties hereto agree to such termination. The Parties hereto also
agree that they will take all actions necessary to terminate or to cause their
respective Affiliates to terminate each of the Ancillary Agreements (if any)
that are executed as of the date hereof if this Agreement is terminated.

embody the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior and

Ancillary Agreement, the former shall prevail in every case.

11.3  _Severability_. If any provision hereof shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction or as a result of future

the overall intentions of the Parties as evidenced hereby.

 

11.4 _Assignment; Binding Agreement_. This Agreement and various rights and
obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Neither

transfer and assign its rights hereunder to any of its Affiliates without the
need for such consent. Notwithstanding any such assignment to an Affiliate,
the assignor shall remain fully liable to the other Party in accordance
herewith, regardless of whether or not any assignment to an Affiliate was
effected with the consent of the other Party.

 

11.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in multiple
counterparts, and in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

otherwise be required to be included, except in case it would be reasonably
apparent from the information disclosed in the concerned Disclosure Schedule
that such information also qualifies other Disclosure Schedules. The
inclusion of any information in any Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to
be an admission or acknowledgment that such information is material or outside

hereof.

 



90 11.15 _Expenses_. Regardless of whether the transactions provided for in this
