to Seller a draft purchase price allocation for Sellers review. Seller has
thirty (30) days after the receipt of the draft allocation to propose any
changes to Buyers draft. Buyer and Seller will reasonably cooperate to
promptly resolve any disputes with respect to the allocation. If the Parties
are unable to resolve any disputed item in the allocation within twenty (20)
days after Buyers receipt of Sellers proposed changes, the Parties will
submit any such remaining disputed items to the Accounting Arbitrator who will
act as an arbitrator to determine only those items in dispute. Within thirty
(30) days following submission to the Accounting Arbitrator, the Accounting
Arbitrator will prepare and deliver a written determination to the Parties
with respect to the allocation (such determination to include a work sheet
setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination
and to be based solely on information provided to the Accounting Arbitrator by
the Parties). The allocation agreed to by the Parties or determined by
the Accounting Arbitrator shall become the final allocation (the "
_Allocation_ ") and in the event there is an adjustment to the purchase price
after the Allocation has been determined, the Allocation will be revised in
accordance with the methodology set forth in this _Section 2.4_ to reflect
such adjustments (the " _Revised Allocation_ "). The Allocation or Revised
Allocation will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties as to
such disputed items. Seller and Buyer agree to file all information reports
and Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594 and any amended Tax Returns or claims
for refund) in a manner consistent with the Allocation or Revised Allocation
and neither Seller nor Buyer will take any position inconsistent with such
allocation on any Tax Return or otherwise, unless required to do so by
applicable Law or a "determination," within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1)
of the Code ; provided however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent
Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation or Revised
Allocation, as applicable, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority challenging the Allocation or Revised Allocation, as
applicable. Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other
in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or
assessment challenging the Allocation or Revised Allocation, as applicable.

defense of the Third Party Claim (such election to be without prejudice to the
right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether such claim is an
indemnifiable Loss under this  _Section _7), then the Indemnifying Party
will have the right to defend such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party (who will be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement
at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section
7.3.2_. The Indemnifying Party will have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ that
the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement agreement without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided further_ , that
such consent will not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a
complete and unconditional general release by the third Person asserting the
claim of all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim, and (ii) the
settlement agreement does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the
conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any related
counterclaim against the Person

the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party (who will be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party will
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party
may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if
indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section 7.3.3_, and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 7.3.4 | Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Losses
that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be
asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim
in reasonable detail, will include copies of all available material written
evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of ten (10) Business Days
within which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so respond within such ten (10) Business Day period, the

available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

entitled to indemnification for the amount of Losses exceeding the
Deductible. Seller will not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified

to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party for an aggregate amount of such
Losses exceeding an amount equal to 50% of the Purchase Price;

Party will assign this Agreement or any part hereof without the prior written
consent of the other Party. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective

     | 9.3 | _Rights of Third Parties_. Except for the provisions of
_Section _7, which are intended to be enforceable by the Persons respectively
referred to therein, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is
intended or will be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than
the Parties, any right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Debt Financing Source Parties are intended
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce, _Sections 7.6_ and _9.11_
and this _Section 9.3_. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 54 -  herein, each Party will bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby whether or not such

such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed on the
Disclosure Schedules. No disclosure on the Disclosure Schedules relating to
any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law will be construed as
an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has

Schedules will not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by Seller,
in and of itself, that such information is material to or outside the ordinary
course of the business of the Company or required to be disclosed on the
Disclosure Schedules. Each disclosure on the Disclosure Schedules will be
deemed to qualify other representations and warranties of Seller

_9.8_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the

otherwise modified in any manner that impacts or is otherwise adverse in any
respect to the Debt Financing Source Parties without the prior written consent
of the Debt Financing Source Parties. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 55 -  communications of any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of the release for publication
thereof, will be subject to the prior written consent of Buyer and Seller,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by
such Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will prevent a Party
from publishing such press releases or other public communications as is
necessary to satisfy such Partys obligations at Law or under the rules of any
stock or commodities exchange after consultation with the other Party.  
---|---|--- 



     | 9.10 | _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The
Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they will take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, will amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the Parties to the greatest extent legally permissible.

The Parties further agree that the Parties will not bring suit with respect to
any disputes arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than the above specified courts.
The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that a final and
nonappealable judgment against a Party in any action or proceeding
contemplated above will be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified or exemplified copy of which will be conclusive evidence of the fact
and amount of such judgment. Except to the extent that a different
determination or finding is mandated due to the applicable Law being that of
a different jurisdiction, the Parties agree that all judicial determinations
or findings by a state or federal court in Oklahoma with respect to any matter
under this Agreement will be binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
the Parties agrees that it will not
