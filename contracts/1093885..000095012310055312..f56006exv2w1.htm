AGREEMENT 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and the Parent shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger, and (c) the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the CCC. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Closing will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 300 N. LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60654, on the later of (a) the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) set forth in _Article VI_, and (b) the earlier to occur of (i) during the Marketing Period on a date specified by Parent on three (3) Business Days written notice to the Company and (ii) the first (1st) Business Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period, or another time, date or place as is agreed to in writing by the parties (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the parties shall cause the Agreement of Merger in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Agreement of Merger_ ") and other appropriate and required documents to be delivered for filing with the California Secretary. The Merger shall become effective at the Effective Time. If the California Secretary requires any changes in the Agreement of Merger as a condition to filing or issuing a certificate to the effect that the Merger is effective, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute any necessary revisions incorporating such changes, provided such changes are not inconsistent with and do not result in any material change in the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Conversion of the Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

   

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 1.4(d)_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Dissenter Shares) shall be canceled and shall by virtue of the Merger and without any 

   ##### 

  

    

action on the part of the holder thereof be converted automatically into the
right to receive $11.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the certificate representing such share
of Company Common Stock or in adherence with the applicable procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal or equivalent document for uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") as provided in _Article II_. All such shares of Company
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate or Book-Entry Shares theretofore representing such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which
such  shares of Company Common Stock have been converted, as provided herein
or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of
an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.6_. 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company) as treasury stock or otherwise and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) Each share of Class A common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each share of Class B common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Class B common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. The shares of Class A common stock and the shares of Class B common stock shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction and to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such Articles of Incorporation shall be amended to change the name of the Surviving Corporation to "SonicWALL, Inc." Thereafter, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation may only be amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by Law. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that all references to Merger Sub in the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to refer to "SonicWALL, Inc."). Thereafter, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation may only be amended or repealed in accordance with their terms and the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by Law. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Company Options and Company RSUs_. 

   

 (a) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) the Company Equity Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in the Company Equity Plans or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof. 

   

 (b) _Company Common Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Common Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, shall become fully vested and cancelled and (i) in the case of a Company Common Stock Option having a per share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, for the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Common Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Common Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company Common Stock Option, or (ii) in the case of any Company Common Stock Option having a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, without the payment of cash or issuance of other securities in respect thereof. The cancellation of a Company Common Stock Option as provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of such Company Common Stock Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Common Stock Options notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Companys 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the 

   ##### 

  

    

" _ESPP_ ")) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to provide that, with respect to the ESPP: (i) each individual
participating in the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as
of the date of this Agreement (the " _Final Offering_ ") shall not be
permitted (x) to increase the amount of his or her rate of payroll
contributions thereunder from the rate in effect when the Final
Offering commenced, or (y) to make separate non-payroll contributions to the
ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual who is
not participating in the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence
participation in the ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (iii) the
Final Offering shall end on (and the final Purchase Date (as defined in the
ESPP) shall be) the earlier to occur of June 14 2010 and a date that is five
(5) calendar days prior to the Effective Time; (iv) each ESPP participants
accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of the end
of the Final Offering; and (v) the ESPP shall terminate immediately following
the end of the Final Offering and no further rights shall be granted or
exercised under the ESPP thereafter. All shares of Company Common
Stock purchased in the Final Offering shall be cancelled at the Effective
Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit (each, an " _RSU_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of such shares of Company Stock subject to such RSU and (ii) the Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 1.8 _Dissenter Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Shareholder shall demand to be paid the "fair market value" of its Dissenter Shares, as provided in Chapter 13 of the CCC, such Dissenter Shares shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this _Section 1.8_) and shall entitle such Dissenting Shareholder only to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenter Shares, in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CCC, unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws (in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CCC) or effectively loses the right to dissent. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make (or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment of fair market value of Dissenter Shares prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any such demands prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CCC) or lost the right to dissent, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, the Dissenter Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.8_. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.1 _Paying Agent_. No later than one Business Day following the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ , through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable pursuant to _Article I_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for payments in respect of Company Common Stock Options or Company RSUs, which shall be paid by the Company through its payroll system as soon as practicable following the Closing and in no event later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the Closing). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Article I_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (a) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock; and (b) such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to  _Article I_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, in each case as directed by Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ", it being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be deemed to include Book-Entry Shares) and whose shares of Company Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ (a) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be customarily and reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry account statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which 

   ##### 

  

    

is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Article II_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the
right to demand to be paid the "fair market value" of the shares represented
thereby as contemplated by  _Article I_. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. 

  

 Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. 

  

 Section 2.7 _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates. 

  

 Section 2.8 _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock and or Company Common Stock Options such amount as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law or Order and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of a Certificate or Company Common Stock Option in 

   ##### 

  

    

respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

The Financing Commitments are in full force and effect as of the date hereof and are the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, of the other parties thereto, in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, one or more Debt Financing Commitment may, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, be superseded after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments (the " _Alternative Financing Commitments_ ") replacing the existing Debt Financing Commitment, provided that any Alternative Financing Commitment shall be on terms that are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and the Company (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent, and with such determination based in part of the relevant closing conditions) than the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment such Alternative Financing Commitment is replacing. In such event, (x) the term " _Financing Commitments_ " as used herein shall be deemed to include the Financing Commitments that are not so superseded at the time in question and the Alternative Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect, and (y) the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used herein shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments as modified pursuant to the foregoing clause (x).

Assuming the Financing Commitments are funded, Parent and Merger Sub will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and to pay all of fees and expenses relating to the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which would result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) by the Parent or Merger Sub under the Financing Commitments, and either Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the 

   ##### 

  

    

Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that the Financing Commitments
will not be available to Parent and Merger Sub on the date of the Closing.
Parent has fully paid any and all commitment and other fees that have been
incurred and are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof in connection
with the Financing Commitments and has otherwise satisfied all of the other
terms and conditions required to be satisfied pursuant to the terms of the
Financing Commitments on or prior to the date hereof, and Parent will pay when

financing prior to consummating the Merger.

 Section 4.7 _Brokers_.

or giving any third party a right to terminate or accelerate the rights
thereunder.

Each of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Company and Parent shall (1) give the other party prompt notice of the
commencement or threat of commencement of any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (2) keep the other party informed as to the status of any such
suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or threat, (3) promptly inform
the other party of any material communication concerning the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger
and (4) furnish to the other party such information and assistance as the
other may reasonably request in connection with any filing or other act
undertaken in compliance with the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws.
Except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity, the Company and
Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with any suit, claim, action, investigation
or proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law.
Each of the Company and Parent will permit authorized Representatives of the
other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such
legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity
in connection with any such legal proceeding. 

   

 (c) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) notify the other party in writing if it believes that such party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that would, individually or in the aggregate, likely result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ if continuing on the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) If any Antitakeover Laws are or may become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Parent and the Companys and Parents respective Board of Directors shall promptly grant such approvals and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such other lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger, as the case may be, and otherwise take such other commercially reasonable and lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such transactions. 

  

 Section 5.4 _Proxy_. 

   

 (a) _Proxy Statement_.

 (c) _Information Supplied_. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to it and its Affiliates, employees, or Representatives, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or the Company, as applicable, expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, will, as of the time such documents (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) are mailed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

   ##### 

  

   

requested by Parent, the Company shall amend or supplement the Proxy

 (b) The Company shall establish a record date for purposes of determining Shareholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting (the " _Record Date_ "). Once the Company has established the Record Date, the Company shall not change such Record Date or establish a different record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable law, or a court order. In the event that the date of the Shareholder Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it shall implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new Record Date for the Company Shareholders Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by applicable law, or court order. 

   

 (c) Subject to _Section 5.6_, at the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, make the Company Recommendation and, unless there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall (x) take all reasonable lawful action to solicit the Company Required Vote, and (y) publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after any written request by Parent.

Companys Shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Required Vote.
The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at
least on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) Business Days prior to
the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of
the proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Required
Vote. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of the
principal terms of this Agreement and the Agreement of Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only
matter (other than procedure matters) which the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the Shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders
Meeting. 

  

 Section 5.6 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

   

 (a) Within one (1) Business Day of the date hereof the Company will deliver a written notice to each Person with which ongoing discussions with respect to a Third Party Acquisition Proposal are then pending, to the effect that the Company is ending all such discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and such notice shall also request such Person to promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, commercial contracts between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such Person, or other confidential information provided in connection with such commercial contracts). From the date hereof and during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will not and will not authorize or permit any Subsidiary, or Representative to, directly or indirectly: 

   

 (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage (including by providing information in a manner designed to knowingly encourage) or take any action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted to have discussions) or negotiations regarding, or provide any information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement; or 

   

 (iv) approve, endorse, recommend or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that is intended to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or requires the Company to abandon this Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.6(a)_ at any time prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Company Required Vote, the Company may, subject to compliance with this _Section 5.6_: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) provide information in response to a request therefor to a Person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement if and only if, prior to providing such information, the Company has received from the Person so requesting such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) make available to Parent any material information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such access and that was not previously made available to Parent or the Parent Representatives; or 

   

 (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 _provided_ , that prior to taking any action described in _Section
5.6(b)(i)_ or  _Section 5.6(b)(ii)_ above, (A) the Company Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders
under applicable Laws and (B) the Company Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith, based on the information then available and
after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. Without
modifying the generality of the foregoing, in making such determinations the
Company Board of Directors shall take into consideration, among
other factors: (x) whether such Third Party is reasonably likely to have
adequate sources of financing or adequate funds to consummate such
Acquisition Proposal and (y) whether such Third Party has given reasonable
assurances that it will not propose obtaining financing as a condition to its
obligation to consummate such Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (c) From the date hereof and during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent of if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such offer or proposal, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified. 

   

 (d) Except as expressly provided in _Section 5.6(e)_, at any time after the date hereof, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof nor any of the directors, whether acting in their individual capacity or as a director, shall: 

   

 (i) (A) withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), 

   #####

Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger, (B) adopt, approve or
recommend or propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise)
an Acquisition Proposal, (C) (x) fail to publicly recommend against any
Acquisition Proposal or (y) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation, in each case of (x) and (y) within five (5) Business Days
after Parent so requests in writing, (D) fail to recommend against any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, or (E)
fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action
described in clauses (A) through (E), a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or 

   

 (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Acquisition Agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, if the Company has received a _bona fide_  written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, (i) the Company Board of Directors may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal, or (ii) the Company Board of Directors may authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if: 

   

 (i) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable Laws; 

   

 (ii) the Company shall have complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.6_ with respect to such Superior Proposal; 

   

 (iii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), to the effect that the Company Board of Directors has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors has resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_, which notice shall include the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal and copies of the documentation setting forth the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal; and 

   

 (A) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to 

   ##### 

  

    

make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board of Directors has determined to be a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.6 _(including
this _Section 5.6(e_)) with respect to such new written notice; and

Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing Commitments, of which Parent becomes aware, or any termination of the Financing Commitments.

Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or Representatives pursuant to
the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.12(b)_ shall be effective
until the Effective Time; provided, further, that nothing herein shall
require such assistance to the extent it would require the Company to pay
(or to agree to pay) any fees, reimburse any expenses, incur any liability or
give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for which it is not
reimbursed or indemnified; provided, further, that if the Company in good
faith reasonably believes it has delivered the Required Information at the
time the Marketing would commence (assuming the Required Information had been
delivered), it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that effect (stating
when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case receipt of
such Required Information shall be deemed to have been satisfied on the date
of such notice for purposes of the commencement of the Marketing Period
unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not completed
delivery of the Required Information and, within three (3) Business Days
after the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice
to the Company to that effect (stating with reasonable specificity which
Required Information the Company has not delivered). 

   

 (c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend, modify, alter, waive, replace or agree to amend, modify, alter, waive or replace (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term of the Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount) beyond what is contemplated under the Debt Financing Commitment (other than as a result of the exercise of any lender flex provisions contained in any fee letter entered into by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with such Debt Financing Commitment (provided that no such 

   ##### 

  

    

exercise shall result in a reduction of the aggregate committed amount of
financing under the Debt Financing Commitment)) or (y) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (II) make the funding
of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitments (including any lender flex
provisions contained in any fee letter entered into by Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with such Debt Financing Commitment), including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Parent and
Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing at the Closing set forth therein
that are within its control, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment (other than changes to such terms and conditions as a
result of the exercise of any lender flex provisions contained in any fee
letter or other changes that, in each case, do not reduce the
aggregate committed amount of financing under, or the conditionality of, the
Debt Financing Commitment) and provide copies of such definitive agreements
to the Company; and (iv) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the
Financing Commitments, consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing.
In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment (including
any lender flex provisions contained in any fee letter entered into by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with such Debt Financing Commitment and other
that changes to such terms and conditions that, in each case, do not reduce
the aggregate committed amount of financing under, or the conditionality of,
the Debt Financing Commitment), the Parent shall promptly notify the Company
(and in any event within one (1) Business Day thereof) and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Parent
and Merger Sub and in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby promptly following the occurrence of such
event.

Each Continuing Employee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, receive full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting. With respect to any health benefit plans maintained by Parent for the benefit of Continuing Employees located in the United States, subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or applicable law, Parent shall: (A) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, to the extent satisfied or waived under a similar Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time; and (B) give effect, in determining any deductible maximum out-of-pocket limitations in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, to amounts paid by such Continuing Employees with respect to substantially similar plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

Company shall be its sole and exclusive remedy as set forth in _Section
8.8(a)_. 

   

 (c) _Parent Termination Fee_. 

   

 (i) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (x) _Section 7.1(h)_ (Parent Breach) or (y) _Section 7.1(i)_ (Failure to Close), then Parent shall promptly pay or cause to be paid a fee equal to $60,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") to the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days following such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by the Company.

 (e) _Acknowledgment_. The parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_ are not a penalty
but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_, the parties would not have
entered into this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, except that the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_,  _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_, this _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ shall survive such termination. 

  

 Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any time before or after the Company Required Vote has been obtained and prior to the filing of the Agreement of Merger with the California Secretary; provided, however, that, after the Company Required Vote shall have been obtained, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made which by Law requires the further approval of the Company Common Shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended, changed or supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to the provisions of _Section 7.4_, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 8.8 _Enforcement_. 

   

 (a) _Remedies of Parent and Merger Sub_. 

    

 (i) _Specific Performance_. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including the Companys obligation to consummate the Merger. 

   

 (ii) _Company Termination Fee_. Parent shall be entitled to payment of the Company Termination Fee if and when payable under _Section 7.2(b)_ hereof. 

   

 (iii) _Parent Expenses_. Parent shall be entitled to reimbursement of Parent Expenses if and when payable under _Section 7.2(d)_ hereof. 

   

 (iv) _Termination_. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ hereof. 

   

 (v) _Damages_. Other than in the case of fraud, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective equityholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, controlling persons, assignees or Affiliates of any of the foregoing have the right to seek or obtain money damages from the Company under this Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) other than the right of Parent and Merger Sub to payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses as set forth in _Sections 8.8(a)(ii)_ and _(a)(iii)_  above. 

  

 (b) _Remedies of the Company_. 

    

 (i) _Specific Performance  Closing_. Prior to a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII hereof, the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable remedies to enforce Parents and Merger Subs obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger only in the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_, (ii) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used in accordance with _Section 5.12_, such alternative financing) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent and Parents sources of Debt 

   ##### 

  

    

Financing that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically the Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded
(or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under the specific
circumstances and as specifically set forth in this _Section 8.8(b)_. For
the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, under no
circumstances shall the Company be entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee. 

   

 (ii) _Specific Performance Other Covenants_. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and other than as it relates to the right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger (which are governed by the provisions of _Section 8.8(b)(i)_), the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, but not limited to demanding Parent and Merger Sub to use commercially reasonable best efforts to secure the Debt Financing). 

   

 (iii) _Parent Termination Fee_. The Company shall be entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee if and when payable under _Section 7.2(c)_ hereof. 

   

 (iv) _Termination_. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ hereof. 

   

 (v) _Damages; Expenses_.

In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Lender Parties have any liability or obligation to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective equityholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, controlling persons or assignees or Affiliates of any of the foregoing relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 8.8(b)(v)_ shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or the Lender 

   ##### 

  

    

Parties under the Debt Financing Commitment or Parents or Merger
Subs obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (c) _Money Damages Not Adequate_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions under this Agreement to which the right of specific performance is applicable were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Each party hereby agrees, solely to the extent specific performance is available to it under this _Section 8.8_, not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 8.8_. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction sought in accordance with the terms of this _Section 8.8_. 

   

 (d) _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for in this _Section 8.8_ shall be the parties sole and exclusive remedies for any breaches this Agreement or any claims relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that such party may have against the other party or any of its Representatives arising under or based upon any federal, state or local law (including any securities law, common law or otherwise) for any breach of the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement. 

   

 Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provision hereof. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a valid, legal and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term. 

  

 Section 8.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_. 

  

 (a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the purpose of any action, proceeding, claim, controversy or dispute 

      ##### 

  

    

(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (including
any such action, proceeding, claim, controversy or dispute involving any
Lender Party), and each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that all
claims in respect of such action, proceeding, claim, controversy or
dispute (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) shall
be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law. 

   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of any summons and complaint and any other process in any other action relating to the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by the personal delivery of copies of such process to such party. Nothing in this  _Section 8.10_ shall affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

   

 Section 8.11 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY MATTERS RELATING TO THE LENDER PARTIES). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.11_ AND SUCH WAIVERS SHALL EXTEND TO AND BENEFIT THE LENDER PARTIES.
