question so that Purchaser would not in effect acquire the substantial benefit
of all such rights, would constitute a breach under any applicable Contract

Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require
it to incur any financial obligation or any other onerous obligation) and

the taking of any required action, as applicable. To the extent that any such

Purchasers sole cost and expense, (a) provide to Purchaser the benefits of
any such Nonassignable Right, (b) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful
arrangement requested by Purchaser designed to provide such benefits to
Purchaser; and (c) at the reasonable request of Purchaser, enforce for the

connection therewith and shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless against any
such liability or obligations thereunder arising or to be performed on or
after the Closing Date, other than with respect to any grossly negligent or
bad faith acts or omissions of Seller. If such consent is subsequently
obtained, the Purchased Asset will be deemed for purposes of this Agreement
to have been transferred effective as of the Closing Date.

authorized officer of Seller, setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of

_Objection Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of such
objection and the adjustment to the Final Net Working Capital that such Party
believes should be made. Any items on the Post-Closing Statement not disputed
in the Objection Notice(s) shall be irrevocably deemed to be accepted by the
other Party. Each Party shall have fifteen (15) days after its receipt of an
Objection Notice to review and respond in writing to such Objection Notice. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with
respect to the determination of the disputed items within thirty (30) days
following a Partys written response to the Objection Notice (the "
_Negotiation Period_ "), they shall refer their remaining differences (the "
_Contested Adjustments_ ") to KPMG (the " _CPA Firm_ "), who shall, acting as
an expert and not as an arbitrator, determine in accordance with this
Agreement and, only with respect to the Contested Adjustments so submitted,

adjustment. The procedure and schedule under which any dispute with respect to
any remaining Contested Adjustments shall be submitted to the CPA Firm shall
be as follows: 

---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

Purchaser and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause

each Contested Adjustment shall be only within the ranges submitted by Seller
and Purchaser and shall be conclusive and binding upon Purchaser and Seller.

     | 1.9.3 |

The " _Adjusted Net Working Capital_ " shall be (a) the Final Net Working
Capital, if no Objection Notice is delivered by either Party in accordance

respond to any Objection Notice in accordance with Section 1.9.2, or (c) the
Final Net Working Capital as adjusted by either (i) the agreement of Seller
and Purchaser or (ii) the CPA Firm (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that the CPA Firm may determine the adjustment to the Final Net
Working Capital only with respect to the remaining Contested Adjustments
submitted to the CPA Firm pursuant to this Section 1.9). 

---|---|--- 
    



- 11 \- 

      | 1.9.4 |

Any costs relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm shall be allocated

the same proportion that (x) the aggregate dollar amount of Contested
Adjustments submitted to the CPA Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by
Seller bears to (y) the total dollar amount of all Contested Adjustments
submitted to the CPA Firm, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the balance
of such costs, if any. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear the fees of their
respective counsel, accountants and other representatives incurred in
connection with the determination of the Adjusted Net Working Capital.

Capital, then Purchaser shall pay such excess to Seller (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by Seller)

Capital is finalized in accordance with this Section 1.9. If the Estimated
Net Working Capital is greater than the Adjusted Net Working Capital, then
Seller shall pay such excess to Purchaser (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated in writing by Purchaser) within

Capital under the Post-Closing Statement (including the Accrued Rebates

Net Working Capital in accordance with this Section 1.9 (including the
Accrued Rebates Calculation), and any other document or information reasonably
requested by such other Party or its representatives for the purpose of
reviewing the Post-Closing Statement or the Accrued Rebates Calculation,
preparing the Objection Notice and/or reaching a final and binding
determination of the Adjusted Net Working Capital. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent necessary for Purchaser to review the Accrued
Rebates Calculation, any such information shall only be provided to non-
Affiliate, third-party representatives of the Purchaser who have agreed (x)
not to disclose such information or any part thereof to Purchaser or its
Affiliates, (y) to otherwise protect and manage such information in accordance
with applicable antitrust Laws, and (z) who have agreed to be bound by other
customary confidentiality provisions with respect to such information.

deemed to be, and each of Purchaser and Seller shall treat them as,
adjustments to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local, and all other
income Tax purposes.

appropriate) shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets in accordance with
Section 1060(c) of the Code, and Purchaser shall prepare such allocation and
deliver a copy of such allocation to Seller within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date (the "Allocation Schedule"). Within twenty (20) Business Days

Seller shall (prior to the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day
period) deliver to Purchaser a written notice setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis of such objection and the adjustments to the Allocation
Schedule that Seller believes should be made. Any items in the Allocation
Schedule not disputed by Seller in such notice shall be irrevocably deemed to
be accepted by Seller. If Purchaser does not agree to any items timely
disputed by Seller in accordance with this Section 1.10, Purchaser shall refer
such items to the CPA Firm to be resolved by using the same process and
schedule set forth in Sections 1.9.2(a) through 1.9.2(d), _mutatis mutandis_ ,
and by treating such items as Contested Adjustments for such purpose. The
Allocation Schedule shall be modified by Purchaser to take into account any
adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.9 (the
Allocation Schedule, as so modified and as determined after resolution of any
dispute in accordance with this Section 1.10, being referred to as the
"Adjusted Allocation Schedule") and Purchaser shall provide a copy of the
Adjusted Allocation Schedule to Seller. Seller and Purchaser each agrees to be

respect to any Real Property Lease.

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not
to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating
with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or
by any other manner, any business or any Person or division thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to: (i) delay the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or
(iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(c) During the Interim Period, each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to
this Section 5.3, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall include: (i) in the
case of each of Purchaser and Seller, if Purchaser or Seller receives a formal
request for additional information or documentary material from an
Antitrust Authority, substantially complying with such formal request within
thirty (30) days following the date of its receipt thereof; (ii) in the case
of Seller only, subject to Purchasers compliance with Section 5.3.4(d),
not frustrating or impeding Purchasers strategy or negotiating positions
with any Antitrust Authority; and (iii) in the case of Purchaser only, at its
sole cost, complying with all restrictions and conditions, if any, imposed by
any Antitrust Authority with respect to Antitrust Laws as a requirement for
granting any necessary clearance or terminating any applicable waiting period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.3.4 shall require, or
be construed to require, any Buyer Party or any of its Affiliates to agree to
(x) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing
Date, any assets, businesses or interests of such Buyer Party or any of its
Affiliates; (y) any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in,
the operations of any such assets, businesses or interests which, in either
case, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or
materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to any
Buyer Party of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Operative Agreements; or (z) any material modification or waiver of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each party hereto shall
promptly inform the other party of any material communication made by such
party to, or received by such party from, any Antitrust Authority or any other
Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

contemplated herein or in any other Operative Agreement without the agreement
of the other Party(ies) after review of such press release or announcement,
except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a securities

the extent so required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer Parties may
distribute information about this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein to the lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective Lenders of, the

_Insurance_ 

---|--- 
 

Effective upon the Closing, Seller shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to terminate all insurance coverage provided by Seller to the
Catawba Mill Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Obligations for the
period beginning immediately following the Closing, provided that the benefit
of any pending claim acquired by Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.1.18 shall
be transferred to Purchaser and Seller shall not take any action that would
impair such claims. Regardless of whether or not any such insurance coverage
was terminated pursuant to the preceding sentence, no insurance coverage will
be available to Purchaser under any of such policies (including with respect
to matters occurring or arising on or prior to the Closing Date). For greater
certainty, all pre-paid insurance with respect to the Catawba Mill Business
(and the right to make claims with respect to any insurance policy) shall
belong to Seller, and Purchaser shall promptly remit to Seller any amount
received in connection therewith.

 



   5.6 |

---|--- 
 



     | 5.6.1 |

Each Buyer Party acknowledges and agrees that (a) it has conducted its own

     | 5.6.2 |

The Buyer Parties acknowledge that neither Seller nor any of its directors,

other information relating to the Catawba Mill Business) provided or made
available to it or its representatives (including in materials furnished in

Seller insofar as it has made the specific representations and warranties set

---|---|--- 



     | 5.6.3 |

To the fullest extent permitted by Law, none of the Seller nor any of its
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, Affiliates, agents, advisors,
or representatives, shall have any liability, obligation or responsibility
whatsoever to the Buyer Parties (including in contract or tort, as a
fiduciary, under any applicable Law or otherwise) based upon any information
(including any estimates, projections, forecasts, operating plans or budgets
concerning financial or other information relating to the Catawba Mill
Business and including for greater certainty the Amec Reports) provided or
made available, or statements made (including in materials furnished in the
Data Room, in presentations by Sellers management, or set forth in the
Management Letter), except that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to
Seller insofar as it has made the specific representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement, including Section 3 hereof, or any other Operative
Agreement.

- 43 \- 

      | 5.6.4 |

As part of Purchasers agreement to purchase and accept the Purchased Assets,
each Buyer Party unconditionally and irrevocably waives any and all actual or
potential rights it might have against Seller regarding any form of warranty

including those set forth in Section 3 hereof and the other Operative
Agreements. 

---|---|--- 



     | 5.6.5 |

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall constitute a
waiver with respect to any Fraud claim the Buyer Parties may have against the
Seller.

   5.7 |

_Preservation of Records_ 

---|--- 
 



     | 5.7.1 |

Purchaser shall preserve, until at least the eighth (8th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, all Acquired Books and Records relating to the period prior to
the Closing. After the Closing Date until at least the eighth (8th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, upon any Covered Request from Seller or its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall (a) provide Seller or its Affiliates or their
respective representatives reasonable access to such records during normal
business hours and (b) permit Seller or its Affiliates or their respective
representatives to make copies of such records, in each case at no cost (other
than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). A " _Covered Request_ " shall
mean a written request in connection with an audit, accounting, Tax,
litigation, securities disclosure or other similar need or any other
reasonable legal or business purpose. 

---|---|--- 



     | 5.7.2 |

Seller shall preserve, until at least the eighth (8th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, all retained books and records of Seller related to the Catawba
Mill Business for periods prior to the Closing that are not Acquired Books and

Seller shall (a) provide Purchaser or its Affiliates or their respective
representatives reasonable access to such records during normal business
hours and (b) permit Purchaser or its Affiliates or their respective
representatives to make copies of such records, in each case at no cost (other
than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). 

---|---|--- 



     | 5.7.3 |

Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the other Party
with access to any books or records pursuant to this Section 5.7 where such
access would violate any Law. 

---|---|--- 



   5.8 |

_Environmental Covenants_ 

---|--- 
 



     | 5.8.1 |

During the Interim Period, Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, use
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) repair the equipment or other cause of
the High pH Condition, and (b) assess and remediate the High pH Condition to
the minimum extent required by the South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control (" _DHEC_ ") and applicable Environmental Laws,
consistent with commercially reasonable industry practice (collectively, the "
_High pH Condition Work_ "); provided, however, that if Seller proposes
to remediate such High pH Condition by restricting use of the affected
property, Purchaser shall have the right to review and reject such proposal if
Purchaser reasonably determines that such proposal may interfere significantly
with Purchasers ability to construct and operate a containerboard mill on
the Catawba Mill property at substantially similar costs to construct and
operate, and with comparable production capabilities, as those disclosed in
writing to Seller by Purchaser.  

---|---|--- 
    



- 44 \- 

      | 5.8.2 |

If the High pH Condition Work is not completed by the Closing, Purchaser shall
assume responsibility for and be solely obligated for performing the High pH
Condition Work, and the Purchasers Environmental Reimbursement and the
Sellers Environmental Escrow Contribution (each as defined below) will be
adjusted as set forth below.  

---|---|--- 



     | 5.8.3 |

Purchaser, with the commercially reasonable efforts of Seller to cooperate,
will further explore a number of options concerning environmental liabilities
at the Catawba Mill and Chip Mill, including without limitation: (a) the
benefits of Purchaser applying for a non-responsible party VCC; and (b)
an environmental insurance policy. If Purchaser chooses to pursue an
application for a VCC, and the State of South Carolina or other Governmental
Entity requires Purchaser to undertake, clean-up, removal, or other
remediation of environmental conditions at the Catawba Mill and/or Chip Mill,
Seller will reasonably cooperate with such requests including but not limited
to authorizing Purchasers communications with such Governmental Entity. To
the extent that it becomes necessary to expend funds to undertake such clean-
up, removal, or remediation under the VCC program, including without
limitation, any High pH Condition Work (" _Environmental Work_ "), Seller
will establish and fund at Closing an environmental escrow account (the "
_Environmental Escrow Account_ ") in an amount that is equal to $5,000,000
(the " _Seller s Environmental Escrow Contribution_"). Purchaser will
receive from the Environmental Escrow Account reimbursement of one hundred
percent (100%) of its actual out-of-pocket costs to complete the High pH
Condition Work and reimbursement of fifty percent (50%) of its actual out-of-
pocket costs to complete the Environmental Work unrelated to the High pH
condition work to the minimum extent required pursuant to the VCC, consistent
with commercially reasonable industry practice (the " _Base Environmental
Work_ "). The amount that Purchaser is reimbursed from the Environmental
Escrow Account shall be referred to as the " _Purchaser s Environmental
Reimbursement_." Until the date that is ninety (90) days after the
Environmental Escrow Account has been exhausted or all such amounts remaining
therein have been released to Seller pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, Seller
shall have the right to review the completed Environmental Work, verify the
accuracy of any disbursement from the Environmental Escrow Account prior
to such disbursement, and verify the Estimated Environmental Costs and Final
Environmental Costs. In furtherance of the foregoing, at Sellers request by
advance written notice, Purchaser shall provide reasonable access during
normal business hours to the personnel, properties, premises, and records of
the Catawba Mill Business for purposes of such audit, review and verification.
Seller shall bear the cost of such audit, review and verification, provided
that if the audit, review, and verification reveals a material discrepancy in
any disbursement, then Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers actual costs to
conduct such review. Purchaser will keep Seller apprised of all material
developments related to the VCC or such environmental insurance policy,
including by providing copies of all written communications to and from any
Governmental Entity and providing Seller with reasonable notice and
opportunity to participate in any planned meetings or telephone calls with
any Governmental Entity. The Parties agree and acknowledge that in connection
with exploring remediation options of environmental liabilities related to the
Catawba Mill Business described in this Section 5.8, Purchaser will
be communicating with Governmental Entities, including DHEC, during the
Interim Period. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit such communications
and no such communications shall be considered a breach of this Agreement or
the Access Agreement, provided that Purchaser and Parent shall invite Seller
to participate in all calls and meetings with such Governmental Entities and
shall otherwise keep Seller reasonably informed of all such communications.

      | 5.8.4 |

Within thirty (30) Business Days after the completion of the first phase of
the remedial investigation required under the VCC, Purchaser or Seller may
request that the Sellers Environmental Escrow Contribution be adjusted either
upwards or downwards by providing the other Party a notice setting out its own
revised Estimated Environmental Costs. The term " _Estimated Environmental
Costs_ " shall mean an amount equal to (w) one-half of the expected cost to
complete the Base Environmental Work, plus (x) an allowance for uncertainties
and contingencies with respect to the Base Environmental Work equal to ten
percent (10%) of such expected costs, plus (y) one hundred percent (100%) of
the expected cost to complete the High pH Condition Work and in
accordance with this Section 5.8, and (z) an allowance for uncertainties and
contingencies with respect to the High pH Condition Work equal to ten percent
(10%) of such expected costs. The other Party shall have thirty (30) Business
Days to review and respond in writing to such notice, by providing its own
revised Estimated Environmental Costs. The Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to determine the revised Estimated Environmental Costs and each of
Seller, on one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall upon
reasonable prior notice provide the other Party(ies) with reasonable access to
such Partys environmental experts and consultants for purposes of verifying
the calculation of the Estimated Environmental Costs. If the Parties are
unable to agree on revised Estimated Environmental Costs within fifteen (15)
Business Days after such response, the Parties will mandate an agreed-upon
engineering firm who shall, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
provide its assessment of the revised Estimated Environmental Costs. The "
_Final Estimated Environmental Costs_ " will be the Estimated Environmental
Costs agreed upon by the Parties or, absent such agreement, the Partys
estimate (set forth in the adjustment notice or response, as applicable) which
is closest to the engineering firms assessment of the Estimated Environmental
Costs. If the Final Estimated Environmental Costs is greater than, or lesser
than, the Estimated Environmental Costs, the Sellers Environmental Escrow
Contribution shall be adjusted upwards or downwards accordingly and the
amounts shall be deposited to or disbursed from the Environmental
Escrow Account as required to correspond to the Final Estimated Environmental
Costs. If (a) the Final Estimated Environmental Costs are less than the
Sellers Environmental Escrow Contribution, Purchaser and Seller shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the difference to
Seller within two (2) days after such determination and (b) the Final
Estimated Environmental Costs are more than the Sellers Escrow Contribution,
Seller shall deliver the difference to the Escrow Agent within two (2)
Business Days after such determination.

- 46 \- 

      | 5.8.5 |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Purchasers Environmental
Reimbursement (including without limitation for High pH Condition Work) shall
not exceed the Sellers Environmental Escrow Contribution, as adjusted in
accordance with the immediately preceding subsection. Parent shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to release any unused funds in the Environmental Escrow
Account to Seller no later than two (2) Business Days following (a) Purchaser
or Parent receiving a certificate of completion from DHEC under the VCC, with
respect to the portion of the Environmental Escrow Account allocable to the
Base Environmental Work, plus any accrued interest thereon, and (b) completion
of the High pH Condition Work, with respect to the portion of the
Environmental Escrow Account applicable to the High pH Condition Work, plus
any accrued interest thereon. 

---|---|--- 



     | 5.8.6 |

Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchasers
efforts to effect the transfer of all Environmental Permits required for the
Catawba Mill Business to Purchaser, as required by Environmental Laws,
provided that if such Environmental Permits are not assignable in accordance
with applicable Law, then such Environmental Permits shall be deemed Excluded
Assets for all purposes hereunder. 

---|---|--- 



     | 5.8.7 |

This Section 5.8 contains the sole and exclusive covenants of the Parties with
respect to matters involving compliance with Environmental Laws, the transfer
of Environmental Permits to Purchaser and Releases of Hazardous Substances at
or from the Purchased Assets.

_Taxes on Transfer; Withholding_. 

---|--- 
 

Any sales Tax, use Tax, real property transfer Tax, documentary stamp Tax or
similar Tax attributable to the sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets
shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by
Seller. Seller shall timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect
to such Taxes (and Purchaser shall cooperate with respect thereto
as necessary), and each of Purchaser and Seller shall bear fifty percent
(50%) of the out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the filing of any such
return. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be
deducted and withheld) from any amounts payable in respect of the Purchased
Assets or any other payments contemplated by this Agreement such amount, if
any, as Purchaser determines in good faith (with Sellers consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld) is required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under applicable Law, and to collect any necessary
Tax forms for avoiding such withholding, including IRS Form W-9, or any
similar information, from the Seller and any other recipient of any payment
hereunder. Any applicable withholding Tax attributable to the sale or transfer
of the Purchased Assets (or any other payments contemplated by this
Agreement) shall be withheld by Purchaser, timely remitted to the applicable
Taxing Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to Seller (or such other recipient as applicable in respect
of which such withholding was made). Purchaser and Seller each agree to timely
sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate
to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns
with respect to, such Taxes.

     | 5.10.1 |

To the extent not otherwise covered by the adjustment to the Closing Purchase
Price contemplated by Section 1.9, all real estate and personal property
Taxes, and similar state and local Taxes (including school taxes) and special
assessments with respect to the Purchased Assets shall be allocated to a
Straddle Period as follows: the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to
the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed equal to the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period (any remaining such Taxes for such Straddle
Period shall be allocable to the Post-Closing Period). Seller shall be liable
for such Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period and Purchaser shall be liable for
such Taxes for any Post-Closing Period. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for
any such Straddle Period Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period paid by Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any such Straddle Period Taxes for a
Post-Closing Period paid by Seller.

     | 5.10.2 |

The Parties shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives
to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in
resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating
to Taxes, including by retaining, maintaining and making available to each
other all records reasonably necessary in connection with Taxes and making

Purchased Assets to Purchaser, it being understood that any Liabilities

jurisdiction which would not otherwise constitute Assumed Obligations shall be

Prior to or upon the Effective Date, Purchaser has obtained the Representation
and Warranty Policy. The Representation and Warranty Policy provides that the
insurer thereunder may not enforce or seek to or enforce any rights of

this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement

such amendment or modification (a) increased or could potentially increase
the Sellers costs, expenses, Liability or obligations in any respect, or (b)
would allow the insurer thereunder or any other Person to, except in the case
of Fraud, subrogate or otherwise make or bring any Action against Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller or any past, present or future director, manager,

_Parent Guarantee_.

     | 5.16.1 |

Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Seller the due and

thereof) of any and all past, present and future Liabilities of Purchaser
under this Agreement and the other Operative Agreements (subject to the terms
and conditions hereof and thereof), including the due and punctual payment of
the Assumed Obligations and all costs of collection and expenses, including

and of this Section 5.16 (the "Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations"). The

the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite organizational power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations under this Section 5.16; (ii) the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent has been duly authorized by all
necessary organizational action, and no other proceedings or actions on the

modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any obligation of
Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement or any other Operative Agreements.
The liability of Parent is direct and unconditional and may be enforced
without requiring Seller first to resort to any other right, remedy or
security. Parent hereby waives any defense of Purchaser or any other Person of
any kind and the right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity whatsoever,
and any right of recourse to security for the debts and obligations of
Purchaser until all of the Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full,
and waives any notice of acceptance; presentment and protest of any
instrument, and notice thereof; notice of default; and all other notices to
which each might otherwise be entitled. Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the
liability of Parent hereunder except the full payment and performance of all
of Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations to Seller. Any and all present and future
debts and obligations of Purchaser to Parent are hereby waived and postponed
in favor of, and subordinated to, the full payment and performance of the
Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations.

the Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or otherwise must be
restored by Seller to Purchaser or to the creditors of Purchaser or any
representative of Purchaser or representative of its creditors upon the

conditions of employment are set forth in (a) the Memorandum of Agreement, by
and between RFPI (f/k/a AbitibiBowater, Inc.), USW, IBEW, IAM, and UAPP, dated

     | 6.1.2 |

At the Closing, Purchaser shall assume all of the obligations of Seller with
respect to the Employees under each of the Collective Bargaining Agreements
and treat affected Employees of the respective bargaining units in accordance
with the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreements, including as to hiring
decisions, staffing levels, benefits programs and other terms permitting
changes. Following the Closing, except as otherwise provided herein or in the
Collective Bargaining Agreements, Purchaser shall have the right in its
exclusive discretion to change employment terms of Union Employees consistent
with its obligations under the Collective Bargaining Agreements and applicable
law. Purchaser has been given access to all Collective Bargaining Agreements
and understands all contractual requirements set forth in the
Collective Bargaining Agreements. Purchaser shall execute all documents
reasonably necessary to effectuate the assumption of each of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements and to obtain a full and unconditional release of Seller
under the Collective Bargaining Agreements with respect to the Employees. No
party to any Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser affirms it has been informed of, and accepts, the terms
related to successorship as set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreements,
including without limitation, Article VI, A of the Memorandum of Agreement, by
and between RFPI (f/k/a AbitibiBowater, Inc.), USW, IBEW, IAM, and UAPP,

party to a Collective Bargaining Agreement and satisfy its obligations as may
be required by any Collective Bargaining Agreement or under applicable law.

this Section 6.2 and the provisions of Sections 6.3 through 6.8. The Non-

_Employee Benefits_ 

---|--- 
 



     | 6.3.1 |

Effective at the Closing, the Transferred Non-Union Employees and the Union
Employees shall cease to be covered by the Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees that are
receiving as of the Closing long-term disability payments under a Benefit
Plan that provides long-term disability coverage, shall continue to receive
such benefits, subject to the terms of such Benefit Plan. From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, (a) to each Union
Employee, such compensation, employee benefits and other terms and conditions
of employment (including OPEB) as are required to be provided to such Union
Employee pursuant to the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement(s), and
(b) to each Transferred Non-Union Employee, for a period of twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date or such longer period of time required by
applicable Law, (i) compensation (including salary, wages and opportunities
for commissions, bonuses, incentive pay, overtime and premium pay), location
of employment and a position of employment that are, in the aggregate, at
least substantially similar to those provided to such Transferred Non-Union
Employee by Seller as of immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee
benefits (including, severance benefits, health and welfare, retirement,
deferred compensation (whether qualified or non-qualified), and defined
contribution make-up plan benefits) that are either (x) in the aggregate, at
least substantially similar to those employee benefits provided to such
Transferred Non-Union Employee by Seller as of immediately prior to the
Closing or (y) provided by Purchaser (or its Affiliates) to its similarly
situated employees.  

---|---|--- 



     | 6.3.2 |

For purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of vacation, severance and
other benefits under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser providing
benefits to Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees (the "
_Purchaser Plans_ "), Purchaser shall credit each Transferred Non-Union
Employee and Union Employee with his or her years of service with Seller and
any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such Transferred Non-Union
Employee or Union Employee (as applicable) was entitled to credit for such
service under any similar Benefit Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing.
The Purchaser Plans shall not deny any Transferred Non-Union Employee or any
Union Employee coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions and shall
credit such individual for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid
pursuant to the Benefit Plans prior to such Transferred Non-Union Employee or
any Union Employee participating in the applicable Purchaser Plans in the
year of initial participation with the Purchaser Plans. 

---|---|--- 



     | 6.3.3 |

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the
termination of employment of any Transferred Non-Union Employee or Union
Employee. The provisions of this Section 6 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties, and no current or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or any other Person shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

- 53 \- 

    6.4 |

_Retirement Plans_ 

---|--- 
 



     | 6.4.1 |

As soon as practicable after the Closing, a defined contribution plan of
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code shall accept a
rollover by Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees of any
"eligible rollover distribution" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of
the Code) including any promissory notes reflecting participant loans from any
retirement plan of Seller that is a defined contribution plan containing a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k)
of the Code. Seller shall take such action as is necessary to amend any
retirement plan of Seller with a 401(k) feature to prevent any
Transferred Non-Union Employees or Union Employees from defaulting on any
outstanding loans solely as a result of a termination of employment with
Seller and its Affiliates. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 6.4.2 |

Without derogating from the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.3, from and after
the Closing, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall provide all Transferred
Non-Union Employees and Union Employees with a tax-qualified defined benefit
pension plan (the " _Purchaser DB Pension Plan_ ") that is substantially
similar to the Seller DB Pension Plan (it being understood, for the avoidance
of doubt, that nothing herein shall require Purchaser to provide any
Transferred Non-Union Employee or Union Employee with any Purchaser DB
Pension Plan if such Transferred Non-Union Employee or Union Employee is not
provided with any Seller DB Pension Plan as of immediately prior to the
Closing, except in the case of Recall Employees). The benefit formula under
the Purchaser DB Pension Plan shall provide each Transferred Non-Union
Employee and Union Employee, upon such individuals termination or retirement
from Purchaser or one of its Affiliates at any time after the Closing, with a
minimum benefit equal to the benefit such individual would have received under
the Seller DB Pension Plan as if such individual had remained employed by
Seller until the date of such termination or retirement from Purchaser (and
any ancillary benefit required by applicable Law). The Parties acknowledge
that the intent of this Section 6.4.2 is to ensure that the tax-qualified
defined benefits provided to the Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union
Employees are not adversely affected by the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | 6.4.3 |

As soon as practicable following Closing, Seller shall cause the calculation
and transfer to the Purchaser DB Pension Plan assets equal to the accumulated
benefit obligation for the Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees
(other than Recall Employees) who participate in the Sellers DB Pension
Plan as of the Closing, calculated using Seller DB Pension Plans current
assumptions and applicable accounting standards as set forth on Schedule 6.4.3
(" _Pension Plan Transfer Amount_ "); provided, however, that the
Pension Plan Transfer Amount shall not be more than that allowed by Code
Section 414(l) and ERISA Section 4044 with respect to such Transferred Non-
Union Employees and Union Employees who participate in the Seller DB Pension
Plan as of Closing, recognizing that the Seller DB Pension Plan shall not be
fully funded as of the Closing. The Pension Plan Transfer Amount shall be
determined as of the Closing Date, and the transfer of the Pension
Plan Transfer Amount shall be made in cash with interest at a rate reasonably
determined by Seller (net of allocable plan and trust expenses) from the
Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of transfer of such assets (the "
_Payment Date_ "), less the amount of any benefit payments made to or in
respect of such Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees during the
period from and including the Closing to, but excluding, the Payment Date.
Prior to such transfer, each of Seller and Purchaser must approve the
calculation of the Pension Plan Transfer Amount; provided, that, if they
cannot so agree, such amount shall be solely and finally determined
in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth on Schedule
6.4.3 (the " _Pension Dispute Procedures_ "). 

---|---|--- 
    



- 54 \- 

      | 6.4.4 |

Purchasers DB Pension Plan shall assume all liabilities and obligations of
Sellers DB Pension Plan with respect to the accrued benefits of the
Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees (other than Recall
Employees) as of the Closing. Upon receipt of the Pension Plan Transfer
Amount, Purchaser shall manage the Pension Plan Transfer Amount in its trust
in a manner that fully protects each such Transferred Non-Union Employee and
Union Employees accrued benefit in accordance with ERISA and the Code.
Thereafter, neither Seller nor Sellers DB Pension Plan shall have any
liability or obligation with respect to the pension benefits of any such
Transferred Non-Union Employee or Union Employee, and Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and Sellers DB Pension
Plan from all Liabilities, costs and expenses that may result to Seller, its
Affiliates, or the Seller DB Pension Plan prior to the Payment Date
with respect to any such Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees
who participated in the Seller DB Pension Plan. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 6.4.5 |

If for any reason the amount transferred from Sellers DB Pension Plan to
Purchasers DB Pension Plan is less than the Pension Plan Transfer Amount
(the amount of the difference being referred to as the " _Shortfall_ "),
Seller shall forthwith pay or procure to be paid to Purchaser an amount in
cash equal to the Shortfall, together with interest thereon at a rate
reasonably determined by Seller from and including the Payment Date to, but
excluding, the date upon which final payment is made in accordance with this
sentence. If for any reason the amount transferred from Sellers DB Pension
Plan to Purchasers DB Pension Plan is greater than the sum of the Pension
Plan Transfer Amount (the amount of the difference being referred to as the "
_Excess_ "), Purchaser shall forthwith pay or procure to be paid to Seller an
amount equal to the Excess, together with interest thereon at the rate as
reasonably determined by Seller from and including the Payment Date to, but
excluding, the date upon which final payment is made in accordance with this
sentence. The existence and amount of any Shortfall or Excess shall be solely
and finally determined in accordance with the Pension Dispute Procedures. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 6.4.6 |

Purchaser shall execute all documents (including all applicable plan documents
and/or amendments and corporate resolutions), and take any other actions
necessary to effectuate the assumption by the Purchaser DB Pension Plan of the
assets and liabilities of the Seller DB Pension Plan with respect to the
Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees (other than the Recall
Employees), including the filing of all applicable filings required by the
Internal Revenue Service, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or
other applicable Governmental Entity, each as set forth in Schedule 6.4.6.
Seller shall execute all documents (including all applicable plan documents
and/or amendments and corporate resolutions), and at Purchasers expense, take
any other actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the transfer to the
Purchaser DB Pension Plan of the assets and liabilities of the Seller DB
Pension Plan with respect to the Transferred Non-Union Employees and
Union Employees (other than the Recall Employees), including the filing of
all applicable filings required by the Internal Revenue Service, Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or other applicable Governmental Entity, each as
set forth in Schedule 6.4.6. The Parties shall take all steps to ensure that
the transactions contemplated in this Section 6.4 meet the requirements of
Section 4062(e)(2)(D) of ERISA so that such transactions do not result in a
"substantial cessation of operations" under Section 4062(e) of ERISA.

      | 6.4.7 |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if Purchaser or any
Affiliate thereof hires any Recall Employee on or before the date such Recall
Employees recall rights under the Collective Bargaining Agreement terminate
("Rights Termination Date"), and such Recall Employee participated in the
Sellers DB Pension Plan at the time such employee was laid off, then as soon
as practicable following December 31, 2019 (in the case of Recall Employees
whose Rights Termination Date is July 31, 2019) or the six-month anniversary
of the latest Rights Termination Date (in the case of all other Recall
Employees), Seller shall cause the calculation and transfer to the Purchaser
DB Pension Plan assets equal to the accumulated benefit obligation for such
hired Recall Employees as of the applicable Rights Termination Date in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4, _mutatis mutandis_ , and
all Liabilities relating to the Seller DB Pension Plan with respect to such
Recall Employees, whenever arising, shall be deemed Assumed Obligations
hereunder.

_COBRA_

in respect of, the provision of continued medical coverage pursuant to its
group health plans for employees under Part 6, Title I of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code and similar provisions of state or local Law (" _COBRA
Continuation Coverage_ "), for all Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union
Employees (and their respective covered dependents) who are entitled to
benefits with respect to any "qualifying event" (within the meaning of COBRA).
Seller shall retain all COBRA responsibilities and obligations imposed on it
by applicable Law for those individuals (and covered dependents) who (a) as of
the Closing Date are currently receiving COBRA Continuation Coverage, (b) are
eligible for COBRA Continuation Coverage as a result of a qualifying event
that occurred prior to the Closing Date and (c) are not employed by Purchaser
on or after the Closing, provided, that, Purchaser has complied with the terms
of this Section 6.5.

Purchaser represents and warrants that it has no plans for a mass layoff or
plant closing (as defined in the WARN Act and the regulations thereunder)
with respect to the Transferred Non-Union Employees and Union Employees
within, at least, the 90 days following the Closing. In the event of any mass
layoff or plant closing in whole or in part after the Closing, as between
Purchaser and Seller, Purchaser shall be responsible for providing any

     | 8.1.4 |

By either Purchaser or Seller, if the other Party (or Parent, in the case of
Sellers right to terminate), breaches in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement in a manner that would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 7, which breach, if curable, has not been cured within
thirty (30) days after the receipt by such other Party of written notice from
the terminating Party specifying such breach (or by two (2) Business Days
prior to the End Date, if earlier), provided, that, the terminating Party is
not then in material breach of this Agreement.

     | 8.1.5 |

By Seller, if the Signing Deposit is not delivered to the Escrow Agent within
two (2) Business Days after the Effective Date in accordance with the terms
hereof.

     | 8.1.6 |

By Seller, if (i) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have
been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied on such date (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing that
would be satisfied at a Closing as of such date) or have been waived in
writing by Purchaser, (ii) Seller has served notice to the Purchaser, which
notice shall be served no earlier than three (3) Business Days prior to the
End Date, indicating that is ready, willing and able to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) Purchaser fails to
complete the Closing within three (3) Business Days following receipt of such
notice.

_Effect of Termination_ 

---|--- 
 



     | 8.2.1 |

Subject to Section 1.11 and Section 8.2.2, if this Agreement is terminated by
any Party pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith terminate
and have no further force and effect, and no Party shall have any liability
hereunder; provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve any Party
from any liability for any and all damages suffered by the other Parties as a
result of (a) any willful and material breach of this Agreement by that Party
or (b) Fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the provisions of Sections
1.11, 5.4, 5.16, this Section 8.2 and Sections 10, 11.1, 11.2, 11.4 through
11.15, 11.17, and 11.18 shall survive such termination indefinitely, and (ii)
nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to release any Party from any
liability for any material breach by such Party of the terms of this
Agreement prior to termination or thereafter with respect to any Section of
this Agreement which survives termination. 

---|---|--- 
    



- 60 \- 

      | 8.2.2 |

If Seller terminates this Agreement (a) pursuant to Section 8.1.6 or (b)
following a willful breach by Purchaser of a material term of this Agreement,
which breach, if not cured after notice of such breach is provided to
Purchaser, would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7, then Purchaser shall pay Seller an amount in cash equal to $20,000,000
(the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") no later than two (2) Business Days after
such termination, by (a) instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Initial
Deposit Amount and the Signing Deposit Amount to Seller (as partial
satisfaction of the Reverse Termination Fee) and (b) wire transfer of the
remainder of the Reverse Termination Fee to an account designated by Seller.
In the event of a termination of this Agreement where Seller is entitled to
receive the Reverse Termination Fee, Sellers receipt of the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2.2 shall, except in the event of
Fraud by Parent or Purchaser, be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at
Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of Seller and its
Affiliates against Purchaser, Parent, their respective Affiliates, for any
breach of this Agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
8.2 shall preclude the Seller from receipt of the Initial Deposit Amount
and/or Signing Deposit Amount in accordance with Section 1.11, except to the
extent such amounts are applied against the Reverse Termination Fee in
accordance with this Section.

_Survival_ 

---|--- 
 

All of the representations and warranties of Parent and Purchaser contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered in connection herewith shall
survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date, at which time all of such representations and warranties shall expire,
except for the Purchaser Fundamental Representations, which shall survive the
Closing until such time as a claim in respect of any breach of such
representations and warranties is barred from being made under any applicable
statute of limitations period and/or statute of repose period imposed by Law.
As required solely to support a claim to be made under the Representation and
Warranty Policy and not against Seller, all of the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered in connection herewith shall survive the Closing for a period of
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date or such longer time as may be
permitted under the Representation and Warranty Policy, at which time all of
such representations and warranties shall expire. As among Parent, Purchaser
and Seller, all of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered in connection herewith shall
not survive, and shall terminate upon, the Closing. All covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement requiring performance from and
after the Closing, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in accordance
with their terms, and no other covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing. Neither Seller, on the one hand, nor
Parent or Purchaser, on the other, will have any liability whatsoever with
respect to any covenant or, with respect to Parent or Purchaser, any
representation or warranty, unless the Indemnified Party delivers to the
Indemnifying Party an Indemnity Notice or Claim Notice, as applicable,
pursuant to the terms hereof prior to the expiration date of the applicable
survival period for such representation, warranty or covenant. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity
(to the extent known at such time) and in writing by notice from the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration date of
the applicable survival period and in accordance with this Section 9 shall
not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant representation,
warranty or covenant, and such claims shall survive until finally resolved
pursuant to the terms hereof.

_Method of Asserting Claims_ 

---|--- 
 

All claims for indemnification under Section 9, other than any Tax Claim
(which shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in Section 9.5) shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:



     | 9.4.1 |

A Party claiming indemnification pursuant to this Section 9 (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or
demand made by a third party against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") shall deliver notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the indemnifying
Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") within fifteen (15) Business Days after
receipt by the Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that the failure to timely give such Claim Notice shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder, except if and to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure.
The Claim Notice shall (a) identify the applicable third party, if known, (b)
state in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to the Losses, (c)
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement
alleged to have been breached or not performed (as applicable), and (d)
specify the estimated amount of the Losses, if known. 

---|---|--- 



     | 9.4.2 |

In the case of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled,
upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume and control the
defense (at the Indemnifying Partys expense) thereof, within thirty (30) days
of receiving the applicable Claim Notice, with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party; provided, that, such Indemnifying Party shall not have
the right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that
(w) is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a Material
Supplier or Material Customer of the Catawba Mill Business (if the
Indemnifying Party is Seller), (x) seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party, (y) the outcome of which could
reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the reputation or good
will of the Indemnified Party or, in the case of Purchaser, the Catawba Mill
Business or (z) relates or otherwise arises in connection with any criminal or
regulatory enforcement Action that is commenced, brought, conducted, tried or
heard by or before, or otherwise involving any Governmental Entity. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, then (a) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof and (b) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party; provided, that, the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense; provided, further, that if in the opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one
counsel to the Indemnified Party including fees for consult by such counsel
with local counsel in each jurisdiction for which counsel determines in good
faith that local counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days following a
Claim Notice or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, may employ
its own counsel and control the defense of the Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party, provided, that, in any such case
the Indemnified Party shall diligently and in good faith contest such Third
Party Claim. Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party controls
the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate
in the defense thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
provision to the counsel of the controlling Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. 

---|---|--- 
    



- 63 \- 

      | 9.4.3 |

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party
shall not enter into settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, except as provided in this Section
9.4.3. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim and if such
settlement (i) constitutes a complete and unconditional discharge and release
of the Indemnified Party, and (ii) provides for no relief other than the
payment of monetary damages by the Indemnifying Party (subject to, if Seller
is the Indemnifying Party, the other limitations set forth herein) and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within 15 days
after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to
contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 9.4.2, it shall
not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

---|---|--- 



     | 9.4.4 |

If an Indemnified Party has a claim against any Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice
(an " _Indemnity Notice_ ") within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified
Party has Knowledge of such claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to any claim for indemnification and shall include in such
Indemnity Notice the estimated amount or the method of computation of the
amount of such claim (to the extent practicable), and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based; provided,
however, that failure to timely give such Indemnity Notice shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder, except if and to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure. If
the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through
negotiations within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Indemnity Notice,
the Indemnified Party may commence an Action in connection therewith. 

---|---|--- 
    



- 64 \- 

      | 9.4.5 |

Subject to this Section 9, once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party
or finally determined to be payable in accordance with this Section 9, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within 15 Business Days by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Indemnified Party.

   9.5 |

_Tax Contests_ 

---|--- 
 



     | 9.5.1 |

If any Taxing Authority asserts any Tax Claim, then the party first receiving
notice of such Tax Claim shall, within seven (7) Business Days after
receiving such notice, provide written notice thereof to the other party. Such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and
shall include a copy of any relevant correspondence received from the Taxing
Authority. 

---|---|--- 



     | 9.5.2 |

Seller shall have the sole right to defend or prosecute, at its sole cost,
expense and risk, any Tax Claim attributable to a Pre-Closing Period.
Purchaser shall take or cause to be taken such actions in connection with
contesting any Tax Claim attributable to a Pre-Closing Period as Seller shall
reasonably request from time to time, including the retention of counsel and
experts as designated by Seller, provided that Seller shall not settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Claim that has an
adverse effect on Purchaser without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. So
long as Seller is defending or prosecuting a Tax Claim attributable to a Pre-
Closing Period, Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to Seller any
information reasonably requested by Seller relating to such Tax Claim, and
Purchaser shall otherwise cooperate with Seller and its representatives in
good faith in order to contest effectively such Tax Claim, including executing
and delivering any necessary powers of attorney required by Seller to contest
such Tax Claim. Purchaser and its authorized representatives shall
be entitled, at Purchasers expense, to attend, but not participate in or
control, all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to any such Tax
claim. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 9.5.3 |

Purchaser shall have the sole right to defend or prosecute, at its sole cost,
expense and risk, any Tax Claim attributable to a Post-Closing Period. So
long as Purchaser is defending or prosecuting a Tax Claim attributable to a
Post-Closing Period, Seller shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser
any information reasonably requested by Purchaser relating to such Tax Claim,
Seller and its authorized representatives shall be entitled, at its expense,
to attend, but not participate in or control, all conferences, meetings and
proceedings relating to any such Tax Claim.  

---|---|--- 



     | 9.5.4 |

Purchaser shall have the right to defend or prosecute, at its cost, expense
and risk, any Tax Claim attributable to a Straddle Period that does not
exclusively relate either to a Pre-Closing Period or to a Post-Closing Period
(which shall be governed by Sections 9.5.2 and 9.5.3, respectively);
_provided, however_ , that in the case of any such Tax Claim, (a) Seller
shall have the right to participate in such Tax Claim at its own expense and
(b) Purchaser shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such
Tax Claim that affects the liability of Seller under this Section 9 without
the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Any additional Tax resulting from a Tax
Claim attributable to a Straddle Period pursuant to this Section 9.5.4 shall
be borne (i) by Seller, to the extent such Tax is attributable to a Pre-
Closing Period, and (ii) by Purchaser, to the extent such Tax is
attributable to a Post-Closing Period. 

---|---|--- 
    



- 65 \- 

      | 9.5.5 |

In the case of any Tax Claim that is defended or prosecuted to a Final
Determination pursuant to this Section 9.5, the party responsible for such
Tax pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall pay to the applicable Person or Taxing
Authority the amount of any Tax arising or resulting from such Tax Claim
within seven (7) Business Days after such Final Determination (and if such
party pays such amount to the applicable Taxing Authority, such party shall
deliver written evidence of such payment to the other party). In the case of
any Tax Claim not covered by the preceding sentence, the party responsible
for such Tax pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall pay to the applicable Person
or Taxing Authority the full amount of any Tax arising or resulting from such
Tax Claim, at least seven (7) Business Days before the date payment of such
Tax is due (and if such party pays such amount to the applicable Taxing
Authority, such party shall deliver written evidence of such payment to the
other party). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be required
to make a payment in the circumstances described by either of the two
preceding sentences to the extent such party has been prejudiced by the other
partys failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 9.5.

   9.6 |

_Representation and Warranty Insurance; Order of Recovery; Exclusive Remedy_ 

---|--- 
 



     | 9.6.1 |

Each of Parent and Purchaser agrees that the only source of recovery and
recourse for any claims that any Purchaser Group Member may have related to
or arising from any representation or warranty made by Seller (or any
Affiliate thereof) herein, in the other Operative Documents (other than the
Sawmill Lease, SC Lease and the Seller TSA), or in the Management Letter (in
this latter case, whether directly or indirectly through any claim against the

Member has indemnification claims for Losses under Section 9, then Parent,

Representation and Warranty Policy to the extent the claim could reasonably
be based upon any representation or warranty made by Seller herein or in any
certificate delivered in connection herewith (even if such Purchaser Group
Member would also have a claim for such item under any other provision of
Section 9.2), provided that nothing in this subsection shall limit such
Purchaser Group Members rights hereunder to proceed thereafter against Seller
in accordance with and subject to this Section 9\.

or otherwise), whether for indemnification or otherwise, except for the
indemnity obligations expressly provided in this Section 9 and the other
indemnity obligations expressly provided for in this Agreement or the other
Operative Agreements, which provide the exclusive remedies and causes of
action of the Parties with respect to any matter contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Operative Agreements, and each party hereby expressly
waives and releases any other claim or cause of action arising under Law,
including Laws based on negligence or strict liability, or otherwise against
the other party with respect to any matter, including environmental matters,
contemplated by and /or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and
the other Operative Agreements. Nothing in this Section 9.6 shall limit

Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Partys
Fraud.

---|---|--- 
 



     | 9.7.2 |

In no event shall Seller have any liability or obligation to a Purchaser Group
Member for any Liability to the extent such Liability is taken into account
as a Liability or reserve relating to such matter in calculating the amount of
the Adjusted Net Working Capital, and no amount shall be due under this
Section 9 to the extent that it duplicates another amount already paid under
this Agreement or any other Operative Agreement. 

---|---|---

For purposes of this Section 9, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained

mitigate any Losses after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. 

---|---|--- 



     | 9.9.2 |

If and solely to the extent that an Indemnified Party would receive a double
recovery, the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this Section 9 shall be reduced by any amounts actually recovered by any
Indemnified Party under any (a) indemnification or other recovery under any
Contract between an Indemnified Party and any Person (other than a
Governmental Entity) and (b) insurance policies with respect to such
indemnification claim, including, without limitation, the Representation and
Warranty Policy (each source named in clauses (a) and (b), a " _Collateral
Source_ "). An Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to pursue any claims against all Collateral Sources.

     | 9.9.3 |

Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days
after receipt, an amount equal to the excess of (a) the amount previously
received by the Indemnified Party under this Section 9, plus the amount of the

Taxes or expenses (including increased premiums) incurred in collecting such
amount) actually received by such Indemnified Party, over (b) the amount of
Losses with respect to such claim which the Indemnified Party was entitled to
receive under this Section 9\. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this

pursuant to this Section 9 in respect of such matter, if any, shall be reduced
by the amount of Losses that could have reasonably been mitigated by such
action.

This Agreement, the other Operative Agreements, and the Confidentiality

or the exhibits and schedules attached hereto (other than an exception set
forth as such in the Schedules) or thereto, the statements in the body of this
Agreement will control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth

compelled or required to disclose any Confidential Information by Law or
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law or any

in advance in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information

at Purchasers sole expense, to obtain an appropriate protective order or
other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the

of Seller any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any right of employment for any specified period.



   11.9 |

_No Assignment; Binding Effect_ 

---|--- 
 

Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any Party without the prior written consent of the
other Parties and any attempt to do so will be void; provided, however, that a

and delegate any of its obligations to any direct or indirect Affiliate of
such Buyer Party, provided that such assignment shall not release such Buyer
Party from its obligations hereunder, (b) collaterally assign its rights, but
not its obligations, under this Agreement to any of its financing sources or
to any agent or collateral trustee for such financing sources or (c) assign
any of the environmental liabilities or the right to purchase part of the

consist of wastewater treatment assets, to a third party willing to assume
such liabilities or assets, provided that such assignment shall not release

of and is enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
