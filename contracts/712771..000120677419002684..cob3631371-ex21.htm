(ii) For each share of Company Common Stock (including Company Common Stock
underlying Company Restricted Stock Awards) with respect to which an election
to receive Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been effectively
made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to _Section 2.10_ or _Section
2.11_ (collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "), a number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ "); and

  

(iii) For each share of Company Common Stock (including Company Common Stock
underlying Company Restricted Stock Awards) other than shares as to which a
Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked or
deemed revoked pursuant to _Section 2.10_ or _Section 2.11_ (collectively the
" _Non-Election Shares_ "), the right to receive such Stock Consideration or
Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance with _Section 2.10_.

       

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

(i) The " _Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.780.

  

(ii) The " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " means $16.25.

  

(iii) The " _Merger Consideration_ " means the Cash Consideration and Stock
Consideration described in _Section 2.8(a)_ , as applicable.

  

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. Shares of Company Common Stock (including
Company Common Stock underlying Company Restricted Stock Awards), when
converted in accordance with _Section 2.8(a)_ , shall cease to be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Book Entry Share shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock previously represented thereby (i) the consideration set forth in
_Section 2.8(a)_ , (ii) any dividends or other distributions in accordance
with _Section 2.12(c)_ , and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.12(e)_
, in each case without interest, and in each case to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry
Share in accordance with _Section 2.12_.

  

(d) _Treasury Stock; Excluded Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock held
by the Company as treasury shares or by Parent or by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like,
or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially
owned by third parties and (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, by
Parent, the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company in
respect of a debt previously contracted) shall automatically be canceled and
cease to exist as of the Effective Time and no consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable therefor (all such shares, the " _Excluded Shares_
").

  

2.9 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company, the holder of such Company Stock Option or any
other person or entity, cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over
the per share exercise price under such Company Stock Option, less any Taxes
required to be deducted or withheld in accordance with _Section 2.12(i)_ (the
" _Option Cancellation Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, all Company
Stock Options, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Stock Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Option Cancellation Payment; provided that, if
the exercise price of any such Company Stock Option is equal or greater than
the Per Share Cash Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled
without any payment being made in respect thereof. The Option Cancellation
Payment shall in all cases be paid in cash and shall not be subject to the
proration contemplated by _Section 2.10_. As used in this Agreement, " _Option
Equivalent Shares_ " means the number of shares equal to (x) the aggregate
amount of Option Cancellation Payments, divided by (y) the Per Share Cash
Consideration.

      

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the Closing),
each award in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Company Stock Plan that
is unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ " and, together with the Company
Stock Options, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall fully vest (with any
performance-based vesting condition applicable to such Company Restricted
Stock Award deemed satisfied to the extent provided in the applicable award
agreement) and shall be canceled and converted automatically into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.8_ on the
shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Restricted Stock Award
based on the holder's election in accordance with and subject to _Sections
2.10_ and _2.11_ and treating the shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Award in the same manner as all other shares of
Company Common Stock for such purposes. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Company Restricted Stock Awards all
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provisions of state, local, or foreign Tax law.

  

(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to issue a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock with respect to the settlement of
Company Equity Awards contemplated by this _Section 2.9_.

  

(d) Each holder of a Company Equity Award converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration that would have otherwise been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares to be
delivered to such holder pursuant to _Section 2.8_ and this _Section 2.9_ )
shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, a cash payment
(rounded to the nearest cent) (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest ten-
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) multiplied by the Parent Closing
Date Share Price.

       

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.9_.

  

2.10 _Proration_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock
Awards) to be entitled to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.8(a)_ plus Option Equivalent Shares shall be equal to the product (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of (i) 0.2 and (ii) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including for these purposes the Option Equivalent Shares and
Company Restricted Stock Awards, but excluding Excluded Shares) (the " _Cash
Conversion Number_ "). All other shares of Company Common Stock (including
shares subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards, but excluding Excluded
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock, Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards of rights to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

  

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (including for
these purposes the shares subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards) with
respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made and the Option Equivalent
Shares (the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number,
then all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Cash Election
Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election Shares
held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash
Conversion Number minus the number of Option Equivalent Shares and the
denominator of which is the Cash Election Number minus the number of Option
Equivalent Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with this
_Section 2.10_ , whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up
or down), with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares
being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

       

(ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the
amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number
being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

  

(1) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with
the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with this _Section 2.10_ , whether
fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

  

(2) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the
total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total
number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with this _Section 2.10_ , whether fractions of Stock Election
Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such
holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration.

  

2.11 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Restricted Stock Awards to be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance
with, and subject to, _Sections 2.8_ and _2.10_ (a " _Holder_ ") shall have
the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit
an election in accordance with the following procedures:

  

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.11_ (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder (or subject to
Company Restricted Stock Awards) with respect to which such Holder desires to
make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
owned by such Holder (or subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards) with
respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

  

(b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company,
including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as
prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of
Election_ "), so as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an
Election.

       

(c) Parent (i) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election
not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline to Holders of record as of a date as near as practicable to such
mailing date, and (ii) following such mailing date, shall use all reasonable
efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any
shareholder or holder of Company Restricted Stock Awards who requests such
Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline. The time period between such
mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to herein as the "
_Election Period_ ".

  

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Certificates representing all
certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set forth
in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities
exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States. As used
herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, " _Election
Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal
office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the date which the parties shall
agree is as near as practicable to two (2) Business Days preceding the Closing
Date. The Parties shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably
satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not
more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business
Days prior to, the Election Deadline.

  

(e) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
its Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election
Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of
Election. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares subject to Company Restricted Stock (none
of Parent, the Company nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify
any Holder of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in
effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock, or any shares subject to
Company Restricted Stock, covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof,
be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter
timely made.

  

(f) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke its
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or
her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates,
previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be
automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written
notification from the parties that this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with the terms hereof.

       

(g) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent,
in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the right
to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any
Holder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the method of
issuance and delivery of Parent Common Stock, either certificated or in book
entry, into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger
and (iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, Option
Cancellation Payments and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock.

  

2.12 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc.
or such other agent as mutually agreed upon by the parties (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and the holders of Company Equity Awards and for exchange in accordance with
this _ARTICLE II_ through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and Parent
Common Stock to make all deliveries of cash and Parent Common Stock as
required by this _ARTICLE II_ , pursuant to an exchange agent agreement among
Parent and the Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.12(c)_ and
to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.12(e)_.
Any cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including
as payment for any dividends or other distributions in accordance with
_Section 2.12(c)_ and fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.12(e)_ )
shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration and Option Cancellation Payments contemplated to be paid for
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards, as applicable,
pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent,
_provided_ _that_ no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount
of Merger Consideration or Option Cancellation Payments payable to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Company Equity Awards and any
shortfall as a result of losses shall be replenished promptly by Parent. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Exchange Agent
Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

      

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
and in no event more than ten (10) calendar days after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each
record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate or Book
Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of
Company Common Stock that has been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article
II and that has not theretofore submitted its Certificates or Book Entry
Shares with a Form of Election (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
corresponding certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") representing such shares
to the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message"
with respect to non-certificated shares represented by book entry (" _Book
Entry Shares_ "), and shall be in customary form as directed by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to Company), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented thereby. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holders of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon completion of the calculations
required by _Section 2.8(a)_ , (A) shares of Parent Common Stock representing,
in the aggregate, the Stock Consideration to which such holder of Company
Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and
subject to, _Sections 2.8(a)_ , _2.10_ and _2.11_ and/or (B) a check or wire
of immediately available funds in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of
cash that such holder has the right to receive in respect of (i) the Cash
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
surrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with, and subject
to, _Sections 2.8(a)_ , _2.10_ and _2.111_ , and (ii) dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 2.12(c)_ and cash payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.12(e)_. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration. The Exchange
Agent and Parent, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver
certificated or book entry shares of Parent Common Stock and/or the Cash
Consideration (or any cash in lieu of fractional shares) to which a holder of
Parent Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger
until such holder surrenders the Certificates or Book Entry Shares
representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in
this _Section 2.12_ , or an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity
agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in each case by
Parent. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock
may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry
Shares until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificates or Book
Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a
Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to the Stock Consideration which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Share have been
converted into the right to receive.

       

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.12(e)_ ) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such share of Company Common Stock.

  

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or Parent Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book entry credit of
the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest
shall relate to any such fractional share and such fractional share shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the
product of (i) the Parent Closing Date Share Price and (ii) the fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.8_ hereof.

  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock after one (1)
year following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand
and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any former holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
thereupon become the property of Parent free and clear of any Liens, claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Surviving Corporation or Company shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental
Authority in the reasonable belief that such delivery was required pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and substance
acceptable to Parent and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

       

(i) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable Merger
Consideration, Option Cancellation Payments, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Company Common Stock, any cash dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ or any other cash amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company
Equity Awards such amounts as Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of
state, local, or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or
Company Equity Awards in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

  

(j) _Book Entry_. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates; _provided_
_that_ Parent may issue any of such shares in physical form at its sole
discretion.

  

2.13 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date of this Agreement and at or
prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or type of
securities by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in
respect thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event
occurs, the Merger Consideration and Option Cancellation Payments will be
adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders thereof the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such adjustment event.

  

2.14 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company, except for the
cancellation of such shares in connection with the Merger. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, bona fide Certificates are
presented to Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

      

2.15 _Joint Proxy and Registration Statement_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later
than 45 days following the date of this Agreement), Parent and the Company
shall prepare the Registration Statement on Form S-4 or other applicable form,
which Parent shall file with the SEC and will include the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to
keep the Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company
and Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be filed with
the SEC and mailed to its respective shareholders as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance and
reservation of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company
Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Parent will advise
the Company promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information, and each of Parent and the Company will
promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication from the
SEC or any state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the
Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to Company Shareholders and Parent Shareholders.

  

2.16 _Company Shareholders ' Meetings_.

  

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with Applicable
Laws and the Company's Charter Documents then in effect to duly give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company
Shareholders ' Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act
(provided, that in any event, unless otherwise agreed by Parent or as set
forth in _Section 2.16(b)_ below, the Company Shareholders' Meeting shall be
called and set for a date that is no later than sixty (60) days after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act), for
the purposes of obtaining the approval of Company Shareholders to adopt this
Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to recommend to
Company Shareholders that they approve this Agreement and the Company shall,
acting through its Board of Directors, (x) recommend that Company Shareholders
approve this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (y) include the
Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (z) use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from Company Shareholders proxies in favor
of the approval of this Agreement, including by communicating to Company
Shareholders the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that
they approve this Agreement, in each case except to the extent the Company's
Board of Directors has made an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined
below) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If requested by Parent,
the Company shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to
assist in the solicitation of proxies from Company Shareholders relating to
the Company Shareholders' Meeting.

       

(b) The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting
(x) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or
amended disclosure documentation that the Company's Board of Directors has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
is required to be filed and disseminated under Applicable Law or (y) if, as of
the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
necessary vote of the Company Shareholders to approve this Agreement, and
except to the extent the Company's Board of Directors has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change (as defined below) subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Company shall continue to use all reasonable best
efforts, together with their respective proxy solicitors, if any, to assist in
the solicitation of proxies from Company Shareholders relating to the adoption
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
Shareholders' Meeting shall be convened, and this Agreement shall be submitted
to the Company Shareholders at the Company Shareholders' Meeting for the
purpose of obtaining the necessary approval of Company Shareholders to adopt
this Agreement, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the
Company of such obligation.

  

(c) Neither the Company's Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall,
except as expressly permitted by this _Section 2.16(c)_ , (x) withdraw,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make, the Company Recommendation or (y)
approve or recommend to the Company Shareholders, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to the Company Shareholders, any Acquisition Proposal
(each, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement, the Company's Board of Directors may
submit this Agreement to the Company Shareholders without recommendation, or
may change its recommendation (although the resolutions approving this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended and, in any
event, this Agreement, unless terminated in accordance with its terms, shall
be submitted to the Company Shareholders at the Company Shareholders'
Meeting), in which event the Board of Directors of the Company may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation or change in its recommendation to
the Company Shareholders in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law, if and only if:

  

(i) the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor,
that it has received an unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal (that did
not result from a breach of _Section 5.9_ ) that constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and that has not been withdrawn;

     

(ii) the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that recommending or continuing to
recommend this Agreement would be reasonably likely to result in a violation
of its fiduciary duties to the Company and its Shareholders under Applicable
Law;

 

(iii) the Company's Board of Directors provides written notice (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") to Parent of its receipt of the Acquisition Proposal
and its intent to withdraw the Company Recommendation or make an Adverse
Recommendation Change at the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day
following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (and
include a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation) and identify the
Person or Persons (and, if any entity, the ultimate parent company of such
Person or Persons) making such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that
any amendment (and each successive amendment) to any financial or other
material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Recommendation Change, except that the five Business Day period referenced in
clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this _Section 2.16(c)_ shall be three (3)
Business Days);

 

(iv) after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent (if requested by Parent) and provide
Parent reasonable opportunity during the subsequent five (5)-Business Day (or
three (3)-Business Day) period(s) to make such changes in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company's Board of Directors
to proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided, however_ ,
that Parent shall not be required to propose any such changes; and

 

(v) the Company's Board of Directors, following the final such five
(5)-Business Day (or three (3)-Business Day) period, again determines in good
faith, after consultation with such outside legal counsel and such independent
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal if such proposed revisions were given effect and that
failure to withdraw or otherwise not make the Company Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to violate their fiduciary duties to the Company and the
Company Shareholders under Applicable Law.

 

2.17 _Parent Shareholders ' Meeting_.

 

(a) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with Applicable Laws
and Parent's Charter Documents then in effect to duly give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of the Parent Shareholders (the " _Parent Shareholders '
Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act (provided, that in
any event, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, the Parent Shareholders'
Meeting shall be called and set for a date that is no later than sixty (60)
days after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act), for the purposes of obtaining the approval of Parent
Shareholders to adopt this Agreement and any other matters required to be
approved by Parent Shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this
Agreement. The Board of Directors of Parent has resolved to recommend to
Parent Shareholders that they approve this Agreement and Parent shall, acting
through its Board of Directors, (x) recommend that Parent Shareholders approve
this Agreement (the " _Parent Recommendation_ "), (y) include the Parent
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (z) use reasonable
best efforts to solicit from Parent Shareholders proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement, including by communicating to Parent Shareholders
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent that they approve this
Agreement. If requested by the Company, Parent shall engage a proxy solicitor
reasonably acceptable to the Company to assist in the solicitation of proxies
from Parent Shareholders relating to the Parent Shareholders' Meeting.

     

(b) Parent shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholders' Meeting (x) to
allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended
disclosure documentation that the Parent's Board of Directors has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required
to be filed and disseminated under Applicable Law or (y) if, as of the time
for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares
of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting, Parent has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the necessary vote of the
Parent Shareholders to approve this Agreement. Unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Parent Shareholders' Meeting
shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the Parent
Shareholders at the Parent Shareholders' Meeting, for the purpose of voting on
the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Parent of such obligation.

Company simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement to
Parent (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "). Such Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and subsections contained in this _ARTICLE III_ , and the
disclosures in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule

applicable to such other sections and subsections.

 

(b) Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or in any Company
SEC Filings filed by the Company after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date
hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading
"Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Company hereby

under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. True and complete copies of the Company's Charter Documents,
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by the Company to Parent.

 

3.2 _Authority; Binding Nature_.

 

(a) The Company and Bank of New Jersey have all requisite power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, respectively, to
perform their respective obligations hereunder and under the Bank Merger
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Bank Merger Agreement, subject to the third party consents and
Regulatory Approval specifically contemplated herein. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company and Bank of New Jersey of this Agreement and
the Bank Merger Agreement, respectively, and the consummation by the Company
and Bank of New Jersey of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Bank Merger Agreement, have been duly and validly approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company and Bank of New Jersey, both of which have determined
that this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement are fair and in the best
interests of the Company, Bank of New Jersey and their respective
shareholders. Subject to the Company's Shareholders' approval as contemplated
by _Section 6.2(c)_ , and the adoption and approval of the Bank Merger
Agreement by the Company as Bank of New Jersey's sole shareholder, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and Bank of New Jersey are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement or to

Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and constitutes (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent)
the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by the appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, restructuring or similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity). The Company, as the sole shareholder of Bank of New Jersey, has
approved, or shall promptly hereafter approve, the Bank Merger Agreement, and
the Bank Merger Agreement has been, or promptly hereafter shall be, duly
executed by Bank of New Jersey.

     

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all action required to be
taken by them in order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby from the requirements of any "moratorium," "control
share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "shareholder protection,"
"anti-greenmail," "business combination" or other antitakeover Laws of the
State of New Jersey to the extent such antitakeover Laws are applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have taken all action required to be taken by it or its Subsidiaries in order
to make this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby comply with,
and the transactions contemplated hereby do comply with, the requirements of
any provisions of their respective Charter Documents concerning "business
combination," "fair price," "voting requirement," "constituency requirement"
or other related provisions.

 

3.3 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Bank Merger, do not and will not (a) conflict with, or result in
a breach or violation of or default under, any terms or conditions of the
Charter Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) assuming that
the consents and approvals referred to in _Section 3.4_ hereof are duly
obtained, (x) conflict with or violate in any material respect any Applicable
Law as to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) violate, conflict

both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a
right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except in the case
of (y), as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Other than (i) the Regulatory Approvals, (ii)

and performance of this Agreement, and (iii) and such other filings,

authorizations or other actions by, or filings with or notifications to, any
Person or any Governmental Authority on the part of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is required in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including each of the Merger and the Bank
Merger. The Company is unaware of any facts or circumstances which might
prevent the Company from obtaining or effecting any of the authorizations,
consents or approvals provided for in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) of this
paragraph.

     

3.5 _Regulatory Matters_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely
filed (or furnished) all material reports, registrations and statements,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it
was required to file since September 1, 2017 with (i) the FDIC; (ii) the

or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since September 1,
2017, and there has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements
or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority with
respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries since September 1, 2017, in each case, which would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is not aware of any reason
why all required Regulatory Approvals would not be received on a timely basis
without undue delay and without the imposition of any Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition as described in the proviso to _Section 5.3(a)(i)_.

business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased

(a) The financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included (or

been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders'
equity and consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries

GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions. Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP has not resigned (or
informed the Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability or obligation of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet (the " _Interim Balance
Sheet_ ") of the Company included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019 (the " _Interim Balance Sheet Date_ ") (ii)
liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business

(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and control of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom) except as would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Company's Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) to the
Company's Knowledge, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting. To the Company's Knowledge, there
is no reason to believe that the Company's outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any director, officer, auditor,
accountant or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the Company's
Knowledge, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee

accordance with the customary practices and experiences of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and were and will be in accordance with the requirements of GAAP.

  

3.18 _Investment Portfolio_. All investment securities held by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, as reflected in the Company Financial Statements, are
carried in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the applicable
guidelines issued by the Regulatory Agencies. The Company and its Subsidiaries

except securities sold under repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or

Knowledge) any Related Party or such 5% holder has a material interest.

  

3.26 _Insurance_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries are insured by reputable insurers
against such risks and in such amounts as management of the Company reasonably
has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practice. The Company
maintains directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have been refused any
insurance coverage sought or applied for and do not have any reason to believe

or to the Company's Knowledge, any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents or other Persons acting at the direction of or on behalf of

3.31 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (a) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, on the date it (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the Company Shareholders
or at the time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting, (b) the Registration
Statement or any amendment thereto, or (c) the documents and financial
statements of the Company incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any amendment or

under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or
on behalf of Parent for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or

3.32 _Fairness Opinion_. The Board of Directors of the Company has received
the opinion of Sandler O'Neill and Partners, L.P., dated the date of this
Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to
the qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration
is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company Shareholders.

  

3.33 _Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC and Customer
Information_. The Company is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no
reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause it
or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (i) to be operating in violation in
any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (ii) not to be in
satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy
and customer information requirements contained in any federal and state
privacy laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as
well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by the
Company or Bank of New Jersey pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364. The Company is
not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause it to believe that
any non-public customer information or information technology networks
controlled by and material to the operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third
party in a manner that would cause it or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake
any material remedial action. The Board of Directors of the Company (or, where
appropriate, the Board of Directors of any of the Company's Subsidiaries) has
adopted and implemented an anti-money laundering program that contains
adequate and appropriate customer identification verification procedures that
comply with Section 326 of the Patriot Act and such anti-money laundering
program meets the requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the
Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder, and it (or such other of its
Subsidiaries) has complied in all material respects with any requirements to
file reports and other necessary documents as required by the Patriot Act and
the regulations thereunder.

     

3.34 _CRA Compliance_. Bank of New Jersey is "well capitalized" (as that term
is defined at 12 C.F.R. 325.103) and its most recent examination rating under
the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, as amended (" _CRA_ "), was
"satisfactory" or better. To the Company's Knowledge, there is no fact or
circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which would be reasonably likely
to cause Bank of New Jersey to receive any notice of non-compliance with such
provisions of the CRA or cause Bank of New Jersey's CRA rating to decrease
below the "satisfactory" level.

  

3.35 _Company Information_. True and complete copies of all documents listed
in the Company Disclosure Schedule have been made available or provided to
Parent. Except for the minutes and actions related to the process leading to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder, which have not yet
been prepared, approved, executed and/or placed in the Company's corporate
minute books, the corporate minute books, and other financial and corporate
records of the Company are complete and correct in all material respects.

to any Person (including management and advice provided to separate accounts
and participation in wrap fee programs) or is required to register with the

amended. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a broker-dealer
required to be registered under the Exchange Act with the SEC, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries conducts insurance operations that require
a license from any national, state or local governmental authority or
regulatory authority under any applicable Law. Neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries have trust powers, and none of the Company nor its Subsidiaries
provide fiduciary services.

  

3.38 _Cybersecurity_. To the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2017,
no third party has gained unauthorized access to any hardware, software,
databases or embedded control systems (" _Systems_ ") or information
technology assets owned or controlled by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have taken
commercially reasonable steps and implemented commercially reasonable
safeguards to ensure that the Systems and information technology assets are
secure from unauthorized access and free from any disabling codes or
instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, viruses or other software
routines that permit or cause unauthorized access to, or disruption,
impairment, disablement, or destruction of, software, data or other materials.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have implemented backup and disaster
recovery policies, procedures and systems consistent with generally accepted
industry standards for a community bank.

     

3.39 _Data Privacy_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
since January 1, 2017, the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) have been in
compliance in all material respects with their publicly available privacy
policies, and (ii) have used commercially reasonable measures to ensure the
confidentiality, privacy and security of Personal Data. Except as set forth on

Knowledge, since January 1, 2017, no Person has gained unauthorized access to

its Subsidiaries in a manner that, individually or in the aggregate, has
resulted in or is reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Since January 1, 2017, no Person has been awarded compensation
from any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of violation of
any Data Privacy Laws, no claim for such compensation is outstanding and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist which might lead to any
claim for compensation being made.

  

3.40 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company in this Article III, none of the Company or
any other person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with

operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or
prospects, and the Company hereby disclaims any such other representations or
warranties.

standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its activities or the character of the
properties it owns or leases make such qualification necessary, except in such

would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
ability of Parent to perform its obligations under, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

by the Company) the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent enforceable
against Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to the appointment of a
conservator or receiver, bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, moratorium, restructuring or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights and remedies generally and general equitable principles regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

  

4.3 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Parent, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Bank Merger, do not and will not (a) conflict with, or result in
a breach or violation of or default under, any terms or conditions of the
Charter Documents of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) assuming that the

assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except in the case of (y), as
would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

     

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Other than (i) the Regulatory Approvals, (ii)
the approval by Parent Shareholders of the Merger and the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement, and (iii) such other filings,
authorizations, consents, notices or approvals as may be set forth on
_Schedule 4.4_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no consents, approvals,
authorizations or other actions by, or filing with or notifications with, or
notifications to, any Person or any Governmental Authority on the part of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent, except for
such consents, approvals, authorizations or other actions, or filings or
notifications, the failure of which to be obtained would not have a Material
Adverse Effect upon the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under,
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

4.5 _Regulatory Matters_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely
filed (or furnished) all material reports, registrations and statements,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
they were required to file since September 1, 2017 with any Regulatory Agency,
and have paid all applicable fees, premiums and assessments due and payable
thereto, except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of Parent to perform its
obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Since September 1, 2017, each such report, registration and statement,
including financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied, in
all material respects, with Applicable Law. No Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Authority has initiated or has currently pending any formal
enforcement action regarding the business, disclosures or operations of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the ability of Parent to perform its obligations
under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. There is no
material unresolved written violation, criticism, comment or exception by any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority with respect to any report
or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries except where such adverse determination would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect upon the ability of Parent to
perform its obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Parent is not aware of any reason why it would not receive
all required Regulatory Approvals on a timely basis and without the imposition
of any Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition as described in the proviso

any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) seeking to prevent, materially alter or delay
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(b) There is no Order outstanding against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,

January 1, 2016 have held, all licenses, franchises, Permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
and ownership of their respective properties, rights and assets under and
pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor
the cost of obtaining and holding such license, franchise, Permit or
authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, and, to Parent's Knowledge, no suspension or
cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, Permit or authorization
is threatened.

  

(c) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or in
violation of any term or provision of (i) any material contract (as such term

50,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, without par value, 35,352,866 of
which are issued and outstanding and 2,303,940 of which are held in treasury,
each as of August 14, 2019, and (ii) 5,000,000 preferred shares, without par
value, none of which are issued and outstanding, and none of which are held in

Securities Act or Sections 13(a), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, from and after January 1, 2016 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC
Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented if applicable,
(A) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most
recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and (B) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case
of registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

4.12 _Financial Statements_.

  

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Filings, including the related
notes, where applicable (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ "), (i) have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders'
equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to recurring year-end audit
adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been since January 1,
2016 and are being maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP
and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions. Crowe LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

     

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019 (including any
notes thereto), (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since the end of such fiscal
quarter or (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and control of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom) except as would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of Parent's Board of
Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to material
adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) to Parent's Knowledge, any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parent's internal controls over financial reporting. To Parent's
Knowledge, there is no reason to believe that Parent's outside auditors and
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

     

(d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to Parent's Knowledge, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or, to Parent's Knowledge, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Parent
or any committee thereof or to Parent's Knowledge, to any director or officer
of Parent.

 

4.13 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, on the date it (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to the Company Shareholders or at the time
of Company Shareholders' Meeting, (b) the Registration Statement, when filed
with the SEC and when it or any amendment thereto becomes effective under the
Securities Act, or (c) the documents and financial statements of Parent
incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent with
respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement will, when filed by Parent in
final form with the SEC, comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 

4.14 _Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC and Customer
Information_. Parent is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no
reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause it
or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (i) to be operating in violation in
any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (ii) not to be in
satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy
and customer information requirements contained in any federal and state
privacy laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as
well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by Parent
and ConnectOne Bank pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364. The Parent is not aware of
any facts or circumstances that would cause it to believe that any non-public
customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized
third party in a manner that would cause it or any of its Subsidiaries to
undertake any material remedial action. Each of the Board of Directors of
Parent and ConnectOne Bank (or, where appropriate, the Board of Directors of
any of their Subsidiaries) has adopted and implemented an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the
Patriot Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in
all material respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act and the regulations
thereunder, and it (or such other of its Subsidiaries) has complied in all
material respects with any requirements to file reports and other necessary
documents as required by the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder.

     

4.15 _CRA Compliance_. ConnectOne Bank is "well capitalized" (as that term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. 6.4) and its most recent examination rating under the CRA
was "satisfactory" or better. To Parent's Knowledge, there is no fact or
circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which would be reasonably likely
to cause ConnectOne Bank to receive any notice of non-compliance with such
provisions of the CRA or cause ConnectOne Bank's CRA rating to decrease below
the "satisfactory" level.

 

4.16 _Tax Representations_. As of the date of this Agreement it is the present
intention, and as of the date of the Effective Time it will be the present
intention, of Parent to continue, either through Parent or through a member of
Parent's "qualified group" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(d)(4)), at least one significant historic business line of the
Company, or to use at least a significant portion of the Company's historic
business assets in a business, in each case within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(d). As of the date of this Agreement and the date
of the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any "related person" (as defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) to Parent has any plan or
intention to redeem or reacquire, either directly or indirectly, any of the
Parent Common Stock issued to the Company Shareholders in connection with the
Merger. As of the date of this Agreement and the date of the Effective Time,
Parent does own and will own all of the outstanding stock or other equity
interests in ConnectOne Bank. As of the date of this Agreement and as of the
date of the Effective Time, Parent does not have or will not have any plan or
intention to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the assets of the Company
acquired in the Merger, except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of
business or transfers described in Section 368(a)(2)(C) of the Code or
described and permitted in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k).

 

4.17 _Ordinary Course; Lack of Material Adverse Change_. Since December 31,
2018 through the date of this Agreement, except as reflected in the Parent SEC
Filings or as specifically provided by this Agreement, (a) Parent and its
Subsidiaries have operated in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and (b) there has not been any Material
Adverse Change in Parent or any event, change, occurrence, effect or
development that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

 

4.18 _Loans_.

 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, each loan, revolving
credit facility, letter of credit or other extension of credit (including
guarantees) or commitment to extend credit originated or acquired by Parent
and its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Parent Loans_ ") (i) complies in all
material respects with all Applicable Laws, (ii) has been made, entered into
or acquired by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries in accordance with customary
Board of Directors-approved loan policies, (iii) is evidenced by promissory
notes or other evidences of indebtedness, which are true, genuine and what
they purport to be, and which, together with all security agreements and
guarantees, constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of the obligor
named therein, and as applicable, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries and are
enforceable in accordance with their terms, (iv) is in full force and effect,
and (v) to Parent's Knowledge, is not subject to any offset, recoupment,
adjustment or any other valid or cognizable claim or defense by the applicable
borrower; _provided_ _that_ the enforcement of each of (iii) and (v) above may
be limited by the appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, restructuring or
similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general
equitable principles regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity. For purposes of this _Section 4.18(a)_ ,
the phrase "enforceable in accordance with its terms" as it relates to a
Parent Loan does not mean that the borrower has the financial ability to repay
a Parent Loan or that any collateral is sufficient to result in payment of the
Parent Loan secured thereby.

     

 

(b) The Parent and its Subsidiaries have previously disclosed a complete and
correct list of all Parent Loans that, as of June 30, 2019 (i) are
contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest, (ii) are on nonaccrual status or (iii) are classified as "Watch
List," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss," (or words of
similar import) together with the principal amount on each such Parent Loan
and the identity of the obligor thereunder.

 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, each outstanding
Parent Loan (including Parent Loans held for resale or previously sold to
investors) has been solicited and originated and is administered and, where
applicable, serviced, and the relevant files are being maintained, in
accordance with the relevant loan documents in all material respects, Parent's
underwriting and servicing standards (and, in the case of Parent Loans held
for resale or previously sold to investors, the underwriting standards, if
any, of the applicable investors) and with all Applicable Laws and applicable
requirements of any government-sponsored enterprise program.

 

(d) None of the agreements pursuant to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
has sold Parent Loans or pools of Parent Loans or participations in Parent
Loans or pools of Parent Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such
Parent Loans or interests therein, other than repurchase obligations arising
upon breach of representations and warranties, covenants and other obligations
of Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 

(e) There are no Parent Loans to any employee, senior executive officer,
director or other Affiliate of Parent on which the borrower is paying a rate
other than that reflected in the note or the relevant credit agreement. All
Parent Loans to any employee, senior executive officer, director or other
Affiliate of Parent are and were made in compliance in all material respects
with all Applicable Laws, including Regulation O and Regulation W of the
Federal Reserve Board, and were made in the ordinary course of business, and
on the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing
at the time for comparable arms'-length transactions and did not involve more
than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

     

4.19 _Related-Party Transactions_. Other than as disclosed in Parent SEC
Filings, there are no transactions or series of related transactions,
agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are there any currently
proposed transactions or series of related transactions, between Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current director or "executive
officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any person who beneficially owns (as defined in Rules
13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) 5% or more of the outstanding common
stock of Parent (or any of such person's immediate family members or
affiliates) (other than Subsidiaries of Parent) on the other hand, of the type
required to be reported in any Parent SEC Filings pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

4.20 _Information Security_. Except as would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
to Parent's Knowledge, since January 1, 2017, no third party has gained
unauthorized access to any information technology networks controlled by and
material to the operation of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

4.21 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties made by Parent in this Article IV, neither Parent nor any other
person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Parent or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations, assets,
liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent
hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties.

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed):

 

(a) take any action that is intended to or would reasonably be likely to
result in any of its representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement being or becoming untrue in any material respect at any time prior
to the Effective Time, or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VI not being satisfied or in a violation of any provision of this
Agreement;

 

(b) take any action or knowingly fail to take any action, which action or
failure to act could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code;

 

(c) amend, repeal or modify any provision of its Charter Documents in a manner
that would adversely affect the Company or any Company shareholder or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

 

(d) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of
its board of directors in support of, any of the actions prohibited by this
_Section 5.2_.

    

5.3 _Approvals and Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party
pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) obtaining all Regulatory Approvals and obtaining all
other necessary, proper or advisable, waivers, consents, qualifications and
approvals from Governmental Authorities and making all necessary, proper or
advisable registrations, filings and notices and taking all actions and
inactions as may be necessary to obtain an approval, consent, waiver,
qualification or exemption from or provide a notice to any Governmental
Authority; _provided_ _that_ nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require Parent or require or permit the Company, to take any action, or commit
to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection
with obtaining the permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of or
providing notice to any Governmental Authority that would (A) reasonably be
expected to result in Parent or its Subsidiaries becoming subject to any
cease-and-desist order or other order, formal enforcement action or directive
issued by, or written agreement, consent agreement, operating agreement,
memorandum of understanding, commitment letter or similar undertaking with, or
any request to adopt any board resolutions by, any Governmental Authority, in
each case resulting from or arising out of the conduct of the Company's
business or that in any manner relates to the Company, or (B) reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger,
measured on a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination by any
Regulatory Agency or Government Authority that the Merger may not be
consummated as contemplated herein or in a substantially similar manner
immediately following the Effective Time (any of the foregoing matters in
clauses (A) and (B), a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ "); (ii)
obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications,
approvals, waivers or exemptions from or providing notice to nongovernmental
Persons; and (iii) executing and delivering any additional documents or
instruments necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and
the Bank Merger Agreement, including assisting Parent with preparing to
integrate the parties hereto after Closing as promptly and efficiently as
reasonably practicable, subject to _Sections 5.4_ and _5.7_ hereof.

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing _Section 5.3(a)_ ,
promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required in order to
obtain the Regulatory Approvals and to prepare the parties to integrate after
Closing as promptly and efficiently as reasonably practicable, subject to
_Sections 5.4_ and _5.7_ hereof. Parent and the Company shall each use
reasonable best efforts to obtain each such approval and/or provide such
notice as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties shall cooperate with
each other in connection therewith (including the furnishing of any
information and any reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be required
to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or to integrate the parties after Closing
as promptly and efficiently as reasonably practicable, subject to _Sections
5.4_ and _5.7_ hereof). Each party will provide the other with copies of any
applications or notices and all correspondence relating thereto prior to
filing, other than material filed in connection therewith under a claim of
confidentiality. If any Governmental Authority shall require the modification
of any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement as a condition to
granting the Regulatory Approvals, the parties hereto will negotiate in good
faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to seek a mutually agreeable
adjustment to the terms of the transaction contemplated hereby.

     

(c) Subject to Applicable Law, the parties shall advise each other promptly
after receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that the Regulatory Approvals or any other consent or
approval required hereunder will not be obtained or that the receipt of any
such approval will be materially delayed.

  

5.4 _Access; Integration of Data Processing; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) In order to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Bank Merger Agreement and the integration of the business
and operations of the Company, subject to _Section 5.4(c)_ and Applicable Laws
relating to confidentiality and the exchange of information, the Company shall
permit Parent and Parent's Subsidiaries and their officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized Representatives, reasonable access,
throughout the period before the Closing Date, at Parent and Parent's
Subsidiaries' sole expense, (i) during customary business hours, to the
Company's and the Company's Subsidiaries' books, papers and records relating
to the assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities in which
Parent may have a reasonable interest; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to take any action that would provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would result in the
waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications between it and any of
its counsel or where such access or disclosure would violate the rights of
Company customers or would contravene any Applicable Law or Order or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the parties shall attempt to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements, and (ii) during and, as reasonably required, outside
of customary business hours, to telecommunications and electronic data
processing systems, facilities and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the purpose of performing conversion activities related to
data processing integration. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with the Company's regular business operations
during any such access to the Company's property, books and records.

  

(b) At the request of Parent, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause their senior executive officers to, and shall make all reasonable
efforts, outside of customer business hours, to cause their respective
telecommunications and data processing service providers to cooperate and
assist Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with preparation for an
electronic and systematic conversion of all applicable data regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries to Parent and Parent's Subsidiaries systems of
telecommunications and electronic data processing. Electronic and systematic
conversion shall occur at such time as determined by Parent, in its sole
discretion, _provided_ , _however_ , that no such conversion shall occur prior
to the Closing. Parent shall be responsible for reasonable and agreed upon
costs incurred by the Company, including all fees to third parties, in
connection with any such efforts.

       

(c) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to them pursuant to
this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this
_Section 5.4(c)_ shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

  

5.5 _Notification_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand, shall promptly (and in any event within three Business Days after
becoming aware of any such breach) notify the other party or parties in
writing (a) if it believes that such party or parties have materially breached
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or (b) if it believes that any event shall have occurred that might
reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ if
continuing on the Closing Date.

  

5.6 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements or filings with respect to this Agreement, the Bank Merger
Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
shall not issue, and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries to issue, any
such press release or make any such public statement without the prior written
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the
prior written consent of the other party, issue such press release or make
such public statement or filing as may be required by Applicable Law or Order,
or any listing agreement with a national stock exchange or automated quotation
system; _provided_ , _further_ , however that such party shall have first used
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party with respect to such
release, statement or filing.

  

5.7 _No Control of the Company._ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company prior to the Closing Date.

  

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  

(a) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to
provide) to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who, as decided
by Parent in its sole discretion, shall continue employment with the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") (i) base wages or salaries, as applicable, that are substantially
comparable to the base wages or salaries, as applicable, provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (excluding, however, all
equity plans) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
Employee Benefit Plans of the Company provided to each such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (but in no event greater than
the employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements provided to
Parent's or Parent's Subsidiaries' similarly situated employees). To the
extent a Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries,
Parent shall not, for a period of 12 months following the Closing Date, reduce
a Continuing Employee's base wages or salary, as applicable; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit or modify the at-will
nature of the employment of the Continuing Employee.

       

(b) The Company shall deliver an updated copy of _Schedule 3.24(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule to Parent not more than ten (10) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement and shall provide Parent with an updated
copy of _Schedule 3.24(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule within ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Only employees (and their dependents)
shall be participants in the Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by the Company.

  

(c) Except for employees described in in _Section 5.8(d)_ , those employees of
the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Effective Time whom Parent or its
Subsidiaries elect not to employ after the Effective Time as a result of the
Merger, who are employed and then terminated as a result of the Merger within
six (6) months subsequent to the Effective Time, or those employees who
voluntarily resign employment due to an involuntary relocation of the
employee's principal place of employment to a location which is more than
twenty-five (25) miles from the employee's principal place of employment
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to severance
benefits equal to two (2) weeks of annual base pay for each year of service
(including years of service with the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries)
with a minimum of two (2) weeks of annual base pay and a maximum of twenty-six
(26) weeks of annual base pay. Effective as of the day immediately following
the day which is six (6) months subsequent to the Effective Time, all
Continuing Employees will be entitled to severance benefits equal to those
provided by Parent from time to time to its similarly situated employees.
Nothing in this _Section 5.8(c)_ shall be deemed to limit or modify the at-
will employment of the Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the benefit payments described in this _Section 5.8(c)_ shall be
conditioned on execution of a release of claims in a form satisfactory to
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

  

(d) Any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who has or is party to any
employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement or any
other agreement or arrangement or Employee Benefit Plan that provides for any
payment that may be triggered by the Merger or the Bank Merger (other than
under a Company Stock Plan) (the " _CIC Payment_ ") shall not receive any
severance benefits as provided in _Section 5.8(c)_ but will receive the CIC
Payment to the extent it is required to be paid thereunder. Any employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries who waives and relinquishes his or her right
to a CIC Payment will be eligible for a severance payment as provided in
_Section 5.8(c)_ , unless such employee enters into an employment agreement,
severance agreement, change in control agreement or any written similar
agreement or arrangement with the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation.

       

(e) With respect to any employee benefit plan of Parent or Parent's Affiliates
in which any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate on or after
the Closing Date (a " _Parent Plan_ "), Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that each Continuing Employee receives full
credit (including eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement
and severance benefits, but excluding benefit accrual under any defined
benefit Parent Plan or any such credit that would result in a duplication of
benefits) under each Parent Plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes or
may become a participant for service with Surviving Corporation (or any
predecessor to Surviving Corporation) and its Affiliates, solely to the extent
such service was credited under the Employee Benefit Plans. As of the Closing
Date, Parent shall credit (or cause to be credited) to Continuing Employees
the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any vacation
policy or arrangement listed on _Schedule 3.23(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule as of the Closing Date. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a
health plan in which Continuing Employees participate after Closing, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting period, any evidence of insurability requirement and the
application of any pre-existing condition limitation under such plan to the
extent such requirements or limitations were inapplicable to, or were
satisfied under, any Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) cause each Continuing
Employee to be given credit under such health plan with respect to the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs (" _Closing Date Plan Year_ ") for
amounts (such as deductibles and co-payments) paid under any similar Employee
Benefit Plan by such Continuing Employee, with respect to the Closing Date
Plan Year and for which verification is provided by the insurer or third party
administrator of such Employee Benefit Plan, as though such amounts had been
paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of any applicable Parent
Plan.

  

(f) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 5.8_ are included for the sole benefit of Parent and the
Company and nothing contained herein shall (i) be construed as an amendment to
any Employee Benefit Plan or Parent Plan or the creation of any new employee
benefit plan, (ii) create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any
other person, including any employee or former employee of any of Parent, the
Company or their respective Affiliates, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof or (iii) otherwise obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to
maintain any particular Parent Plan or other employee benefit plan or retain
the employment of any particular employee following the Closing Date. Parent
and the Company further acknowledge and agree that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall provide to Parent all employee books and records relating
to Continuing Employees no later than the Closing Date.

  

(g) If requested by Parent, the Company shall terminate (or cause the Bank of
New Jersey to terminate) the 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company or the Bank of
New Jersey, as applicable, on terms acceptable to Parent, and simultaneously
amend the 401(k) Plan to the extent necessary to comply with all Applicable
Laws to the extent not previously amended. Said termination shall provide that
all participants in the 401(k) Plan shall be fully vested in their account
balances thereunder; and the Company shall notify (or cause the Bank of New
Jersey to notify) the 401(k) Plan participants and beneficiaries of such
termination prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Applicable Law requirements.

       

5.9 _No Solicitation of Transaction_.

  

(a) Subject to _Section 5.9(b)_ , from the date hereof until the Closing, or,
if earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_ARTICLE VII_ , the Company shall not, and shall cause all of its Subsidiaries
and each of their respective Representatives to not, directly or indirectly,
(i) take any action to solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiries that constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to the
making of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise
afford access, to any Person (other than Parent or Parent Representatives) any
non-public information or data with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger), or (iv)
enter into any agreement in principle, term sheet, arrangement, understanding,
contract or definitive or preliminary agreement, other than a confidentiality
agreement in order for the Company to comply with _Section 2.16_ , relating to
an Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall,
and shall cause all of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any party or parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.9_ shall
preclude the Company or its Representatives from contacting any such party or
parties solely for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the first
clause of this sentence or to enforce the provisions of any confidentiality
agreement entered into with any Person with respect to a potential Acquisition
Proposal.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in _Section 2.16_ , the
Company may take any of the actions described in _Section 5.9(a)_ (other than
the actions described in _Section 5.9(a)(i)_ ) if, but only if, (i) the
Company has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal,
prior to the Company Shareholders' Meeting, that did not result from a breach
of this _Section 5.9_ ; (ii) the Company's Board of Directors determines (in
accordance with this Agreement) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company has
provided Parent with any noticed required under _Section 2.16_ , which notice
shall be prior to taking any such action; (iv) prior to taking such action,
the Company receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms
no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (or, if such confidentiality agreement includes provisions that are
less favorable in the aggregate to the Company, than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality
Agreement to include such similar provisions); and (v) the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel
that the failure of the Company to take such action would reasonably be
expected to violate its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. The Company
shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public information regarding the
Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person that was not
previously provided to Parent, such additional information to be provided no
later than the date of provision of such information to such other party.

       

(c) In addition to any notices required under _Section 2.16(c)_ , the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent
in writing if any proposals or offers (or modified offers or proposals) are
received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or
discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any
Company Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating
such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information
request and the material terms and conditions of any such proposals, offers or
information requests (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related
documentation or correspondence).

  

5.10 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and Surviving
Corporation shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnitees_ ") in respect of all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties costs and expenses (including legal expenses) in
connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation, whenever
asserted, based on or arising out of the fact that Indemnitee was an officer,
director or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or acts or omissions by
Indemnitee in such capacity or taken at the request of the Company or any
Subsidiary, at or any time prior to the Effective Time (including any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent permitted by Law and (ii) assume
all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Indemnitees in respect
of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company's
Charter Documents and the organizational documents of the Company's
Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall,
and shall cause Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses (including
legal expenses) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 5.10_ as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, provided that the Indemnitee to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay advances if it
shall be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this _Section 5.10_.

  

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain in effect for six years after the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the
Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to such officers and directors so
long as substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend pursuant to this _Section 5.10(b)_ more than an amount per year equal
to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance and,
in the event the cost of such coverage shall exceed that amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. The
provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" policies with the same terms, conditions and coverage as
indicated above have been obtained by the Company for purposes of this
_Section 5.10_ from carriers with the same or better rating as the carrier of
such insurances as of the date of this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation
shall keep such coverage in effect after the Effective Time.

       

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
Representatives and is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any Indemnitee may have under
the Company Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. In the event the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the purchaser of its
assets and properties shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.10_. This _Section 5.10_ shall survive the Effective Time.

  

5.11 _Efforts to Consummate; Further Assurances_.

  

(a) Parent and the Company agree to use reasonable best efforts to satisfy or
cause to be satisfied as soon as practicable their respective obligations
hereunder including, without limitation, seeking to obtain any necessary
shareholder approvals and any required approvals of any Governmental
Authority, and each of Parent and the Company agree not to take any action
which is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to materially adversely
affect or materially delay the ability to obtain such approvals.

  

(b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including
any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of the Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

  

5.12 _Financial Statements_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, the Company
will provide to Parent as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
the twenty-fifth (25th) day following the end of the relevant calendar month,
the monthly unaudited financial statements of the Company as provided to the
Company's management (including any related notes and schedules thereto), for
each of the calendar months ended after the date of this Agreement.

  

5.13 _Tax Matters_.

  

(a) For federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Code Section 368(a)(1)(A), and this
Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereby adopt this
Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368.3(a). After the date of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, after the Effective Time) subject to
the other terms and conditions in this Agreement, each party hereto shall
cooperate and take any action that is required to cause the Merger to qualify,
and will not take any actions or cause any actions to be taken that could
reasonably be likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. All parties
hereto shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

       

(b) The Chief Financial Officer of each of the Parent and the Company shall
execute and deliver to Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP and Holland and Knight LLP
certificates substantially in the form agreed to by the parties and such firms
at such time or times as may reasonably be requested by such firm, including
at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC and the Effective
Time, in connection with each firm's delivery of its Tax opinion pursuant to
_Section 6.2(f)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken
any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be
taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and
representations included in the certificates described in this _Section
5.13(b)_.

  

(c) The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon
any exact actions to be undertaken by the Company, and for the Company to
undertake such actions by December 31, 2019, to minimize the Company's
effective corporate Tax rate with respect to any real estate investment trust
which the Company controls or in which it is a participant in order to ensure
that the minimum effective Tax rate available under Applicable Law continues
to be available to such real estate investment trust.

  

5.14 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger as Merger Consideration to be approved for
listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance prior to the
Effective Time.

  

5.15 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days, notify the other party in
writing of any Proceeding, or of any claim, controversy or contingent
liability that might reasonably be expected to become the subject of a
Proceeding, against it or any of its Subsidiaries, if such Proceeding or
potential Proceeding is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Change. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party
in writing of any Proceeding, pending or, to its Knowledge, threatened against
it or any of its Subsidiaries that (A) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements
contemplated hereby or any actions taken or to be taken by it or its
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (B) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate at their own expense in the defense
or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors or Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Parent's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

       

5.16 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Company and Parent agree
that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and
directors of Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be subject to a
risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares
of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this _Section 5.16_. The Board of Directors of Parent and of
Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
reasonably promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all
such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of Company) any
dispositions of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Company
Restricted Stock Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the case of Parent)
any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock by any Company Insiders who,
immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the
Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  

(b) by either the Company or Parent if the Closing Date shall not have
occurred on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _that_ the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have

date;

  

(c) by either the Company or Parent in the event of (i) a material breach by
the other party of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
which breach cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the
giving of written notice to the breaching party of such breach, and which
breach or breaches would result in a failure to satisfy any condition to
Parent's or the Company's obligations set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section
6.3_ , respectively, or (ii) a material breach by the other party of any of
its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach cannot
be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written
notice to the breaching party of such breach, and which breach or breaches
would result in a failure to satisfy any condition to Parent's or the
Company's obligations set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ ,
respectively; _provided_ _that_ the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party who is then in
material breach of any covenant or agreement hereunder;

  

(d) by either the Company or Parent if (i) final action has been taken by a
Regulatory Agency whose approval is required in connection with this Agreement

final and nonappealable and (y) does not approve this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) any Governmental Authority shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law, or final
nonappealable judgment which has the effect of enjoining, prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; unless failure to obtain approval of the Regulatory Agency or the
action taken by the Governmental Authority shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

       

(e) by Parent if, prior to receipt of approval by Company Shareholders of this
Agreement, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee

Shareholder Meeting, respectively, shall not have been obtained by reason of
the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of such
shareholders as may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with this
Agreement.

  

7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by a party pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ , written notice thereof shall promptly be given to the other
party(ies) hereto, and upon such notice this Agreement shall terminate. Except
as provided under this _Section 7.2_ or otherwise expressly in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further
force and effect, there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto
to the other party(ies), and all rights and obligations of any party hereto
shall cease and the parties shall be released from any and all obligations
hereunder; _provided_ , _that_ (i) the provisions of _Section 5.4(c)_ ,
_Section 7.1_ , this _Section 7.2_ and _ARTICLE VIII_ shall survive any such
termination; (ii) in the event that such termination is effected pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)_ of this Agreement, the non-defaulting party may pursue any
remedy available at law or in equity to enforce its rights and shall be paid
by the defaulting party for all damages, costs and expenses, including without
limitation legal, accounting, investment banking and printing expenses,
incurred or suffered by the non-defaulting party in connection herewith or in
the enforcement of its rights hereunder and (iii) nothing herein shall relieve
any party from liability for damages resulting from fraud or willful and
material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(f)_ ,
then the Company shall, within five Business Days following the date of
termination, pay to Parent the sum equal to $4,500,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ "). The Termination Fee as provided in this _Section 7.2(b)_ shall be
paid to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Company
hereby waives any right to set-off or counterclaim against such amount.

        

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that (i) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company shall have been
communicated to or otherwise made known to the senior management or Board of
Directors of the Company, or any Person or group of Persons shall have
publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company after the date of this Agreement, (ii) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)_ or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ and (iii) prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination the Company
consummates a transaction with respect to an "Acquisition Proposal" (whether
or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above) or enters into
any definitive agreement relating an "Acquisition Proposal" (whether or not
the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company
shall on the earlier of the date such transaction is consummated or such
definitive agreement is entered into, pay to Parent the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided that for purposes of
this _Section 7.2(c)_ , the references to twenty five percent (25%) in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to fifty
percent (50%).

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required to
pay a Termination Fee (a) on more than one occasion or (b) if, at the time
this Agreement is terminated by Parent, this Agreement could have been
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and other than in connection with
fraud or willful breach, the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 7.2(b)_ shall fully discharge the Company from, and be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, with respect to any and all losses that may be
suffered by Parent based upon, resulting from or arising out of the
circumstances giving rise to the termination of this Agreement.

  

(d) In the event of termination of this Agreement by a party for failure to
obtain the required vote at the Parent Shareholders Meeting pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ , Parent shall, within five Business Days following the date
of such termination, pay to the Company an amount equal to the Company's
reasonable costs and legal expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount shall in no instance be greater than
$750,000 (the " _Company Expense Reimbursement_ "). The Company Expense
Reimbursement as provided in this _Section 7.2(d)_ shall be paid to the
Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Parent hereby waives
any right to set-off or counterclaim against such amount.

8.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules
hereto), together with the Voting Agreements and the other documents and
agreements contemplated hereby delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof,
constitute the full and entire understanding and agreement of the parties
hereto in respect of its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings (oral and written) and negotiations between or among the
parties with regard to such subject matter. The Disclosure Schedules and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute a part hereof as though set forth in full
herein.

       

8.3 _Amendments_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules attached
hereto) may not be modified, amended, supplemented, canceled or discharged,
except by a written instrument executed by all parties hereto.

  

8.4 _Waivers_. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
preclude the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver of any
breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or
succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall any waiver be
implied from any course of dealing between the parties. No extension of time
for performance of any obligations or other acts hereunder or under any other
agreement shall be deemed to be an extension of the time for performance of
any other obligations or any other acts. Any waiver, permit, consent or
approval of any kind or character by any party of any covenant, condition,
breach or default under this Agreement, must be in writing signed by the party
to be bound by such waiver, permit, consent or approval and shall be effective
only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.

  

8.5 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. The rights and obligations of this Agreement
shall be binding on and enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided herein, the
rights and obligations of this Agreement may not be assigned by the Company or
Parent without the express prior written consent of the other party. Except
for _Section 5.10_ , which is intended to benefit each Indemnitee and his or
her heirs or representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,

parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  

8.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the laws
of the State of New Jersey, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

  

8.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  

(a) Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in
respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in tort or contract or at law or in
equity, exclusively, in the United States District Court sitting in New Jersey
or any New Jersey state court, and (1) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, (2) waives any objection to laying venue in any
such action or proceeding in such courts, and (3) waives any objection that
such courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any
party. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.

  

(b) Each party hereby (i) consents to service of process in any action between
the parties arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this
Agreement in any manner permitted by New Jersey Law, (ii) agrees that service
of process made in accordance with clause (i) or made by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ , will constitute good and valid service of process in any such
action and (iii) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense, or otherwise) in any such action any claim that service of process
made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid
service of process.

       

8.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 8.8_.

  

8.9 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith with a view to the substitution therefor of a
suitable and equitable solution in order to carry out, so far as may be valid
and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid provision, _provided_
, _that_ the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in
every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not
be in any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and
privileges of the parties hereto shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law.

  

8.10 _Cumulative Remedies; Specific Performance_. All rights and remedies
under this Agreement or otherwise afforded by Applicable Law to any party,
shall be cumulative and not alternative. Without limiting the rights of a
party hereto to pursue all other legal and equitable rights available to such
party for another party's failure (or overtly threatened failure) to perform
its obligations under this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the remedy at law for any failure (or overtly threatened failure) to
perform their respective obligations hereunder would be inadequate and that
each party shall be entitled to specific performance, injunctive relief or
other equitable remedies in the event of any such failure (or overtly
threatened failure) without the need to post bond or other security.

  

8.11 _Expenses_. Each party to this Agreement shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such
transactions are consummated, including all fees and expenses of agents,
Representatives, counsel and accountants.

       

8.12 _Prevailing Party_. In the event that any litigation between the parties
hereto should arise as the result of any breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, the prevailing party in said litigation shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, including attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in litigating entitlement to attorneys' fees and costs and
in determining or quantifying the amount of recoverable attorneys' fees and
costs (through both trial and appellate levels) from the nonprevailing party.

  

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), each of which
shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
instrument.

  

8.14 _Nonsurvival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement other than _Section 5.10_ , _Section
5.11(b)_ and this _Section 8.14_ shall survive the Effective Time, except for
those covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms
apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time.
