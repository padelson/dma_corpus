promptly pay its portion of such obligation to the obligee thereof.

(c) Each of Seller and Buyer shall be permitted to offset any Operating
Expenses owed by such Party to the other Party pursuant to this Section 2.3

Interests during the period of time commencing at the Effective Time or (B)
contained in storage or existing in stock tanks, pipelines and/or plants
(including inventory) as of the Effective Time for which an upward Purchase
Price adjustment was made pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i), (in each case) net of

pursuant to Section 3.3(a), Income Taxes and Asset Taxes) directly incurred in
earning or receiving such proceeds;

(ii) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Seller in accordance with
Section 15.2 but that are paid or otherwise economically borne by Buyer;

of this Agreement) for such Conveyed Interests at Closing;

(vii) subject to Section 3.9, to the extent that Seller is overproduced as
shown with respect to the net Well Imbalances set forth in Schedule 7.11, as
complete and final settlement of all Well Imbalances attributable to the
Conveyed Interests, the sum of $0 which is an amount equal to the product of
the overproduced volumes times $4.48/MMBtu;

the sum of $0 which is an amount equal to the product of the underdelivered
volumes times $4.48/MMBtu;

(ix) an amount equal to all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons relating to
the Conveyed Interests and payable to owners of Working Interests, royalties,
overriding royalties and other similar interests (in each case) that are held
by Seller in suspense as of the Closing Date; and

(x) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer.

3.4 Adjustment Methodology. When available, actual figures will be used for

accordance with Section 3.6 and Section 3.7.

3.5 Preliminary Settlement Statement. Not less than five Business Days prior
to Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review a draft
settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement") that shall set
forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment made in
accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such
Preliminary Settlement Statement and the calculation of the adjustments used
to determine such amount, together with the designation of Seller's accounts
for the wire transfers of funds as set 

forth in Section 3.1 and Section 12.3(d). Within two Business Days after
receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller
a written report containing all changes, with explanation therefor, that Buyer
proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any. The
Parties shall in good faith attempt to agree on the Preliminary Settlement
Statement as soon as possible after Seller's receipt of Buyer's written
report. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties,
will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing; provided that if the
Parties do not agree on an adjustment set forth in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement prior to the Closing, the amount of such adjustment set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement as presented by Seller will be used to adjust
the Purchase Price at Closing.

3.6 Final Settlement Statement.

(a) On or before 240 days after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") prepared by
Seller based on actual income and expenses during the Interim Period and which
takes into account all final adjustments made to the Purchase Price and shows
the resulting final Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Final Price"). The Final
Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts
required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within 30
days after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to
Seller a written report containing any proposed changes to the Final
Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons
therefor (the "Dispute Notice"). Any changes not so specified in the Dispute
Notice shall be deemed waived and Seller's determinations with respect to all
such elements of the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed
specifically in the Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely
deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be
made to the Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as
delivered by Seller will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by
the Parties, and will be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to
further audit or arbitration. If the Final Price set forth in the Final
Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, the Final
Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be final and binding on the
Parties, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(b). Any difference in the
Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary
Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be paid by the owing Party to
the owed Party within 10 days after final determination of such owed amounts
in accordance herewith. All amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be
delivered in United States currency by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified in writing by the relevant Party.

(b) Subject to matters for which a Party has an indemnity obligation pursuant
to Article XIII, the Final Settlement Statement shall be the final accounting
for any and all Operating Expenses, and there shall be no adjustment for, or
obligation to pay, any Operating Expenses between the Parties following the
Final Settlement Statement.

3.7 Disputes. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed
in the Dispute Notice (if any), each of Buyer and Seller shall within 14
Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its
position with regard to such dispute in a written document of 20 pages or less
and submit such summaries to the Houston office of Deloitte and Touche LLP, or
such other Person as the Parties may mutually select (the "Accounting 

Arbitrator"), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement
and any other documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within 20
Business Days after receiving the Parties' respective submissions, the
Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either Seller's
position or Buyer's position with respect to each matter addressed in any
Dispute Notice, based on the materials submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator
as described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator
pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and
will be enforceable against the Parties in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne pro rata
between the Parties with each Party being responsible for the Accounting
Arbitrator's costs to the extent the Accounting Arbitrator has not selected
such Party's position on an aggregate dollar basis with respect to all amounts
submitted for resolution by the Accounting Arbitrator.

3.8 Allocation of Purchase Price / Allocated Values.

(a) On or prior to July 9, 2014, Buyer shall deliver to Seller an updated
version of Exhibit B, solely for the purpose of adding the allocation of the
Purchase Price among Wells and Well Locations to be set forth under the column
titled "Allocated Value" in Exhibit B (the "Allocated Values"); provided that
in allocating the Purchase Price among Wells and Well Locations, Buyer shall
act reasonably. Buyer and Seller agree that such allocation is reasonable and
shall not take positions inconsistent therewith, including in notices to
holders of Preferential Purchase Rights. Seller, however, makes no
representations or warranties as to the accuracy of such values. Disputes
under this Section 3.8 shall be resolved under the procedures described in
Section 3.7 hereof.

(b) For purposes of Income Taxes, Asset Taxes, and other Taxes, Buyer and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation
schedule within 90 days following the Closing Date. Such allocation schedule
shall be reasonably consistent with the Allocated Values, as adjusted pursuant
to this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall report the purchase and sale of the
Conveyed Interests consistently with any such agreed allocation schedule
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

3.9 Allocation for Imbalances at Closing. If, prior to Closing, either Party
discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in Schedule 7.11, then the
Purchase Price shall be further adjusted at Closing pursuant to Sections
3.3(a)(vi), 3.3(a)(vii), 3.3(b)(vii) or 3.3(b)(viii), as applicable, and
Schedule 7.11 will be deemed amended immediately prior to Closing to reflect
the Imbalances for which the Purchase Price is so adjusted.

ARTICLE IV

ACCESS / DISCLAIMERS

4.1 Access.

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Defect Claim
Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms herein)
but subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.1 and obtaining of any
required consents of Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the
Properties (with respect to which consents Seller shall not be obligated to
expend any monies), Seller shall afford to Buyer and its authorized 

representatives ("Buyer's Representatives") reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to the Properties and all Records in Seller's possession at
such time to the extent necessary to conduct the title or environmental review
described in Article V and Article VI. All investigations and due diligence
conducted by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative shall be conducted at Buyer's
sole cost, risk and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done
by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative shall result from Buyer's own
independent review and judgment.

(b) From the Execution Date to the Defect Claim Date, Buyer's inspection right
with respect to the Environmental Condition of the Properties shall be limited
to undertake a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Properties
conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm approved
in advance in writing by Seller and may include only visual inspections and
record reviews relating to the Properties. In conducting such inspection,
Buyer shall not operate any equipment or conduct any testing or sampling of
soil, groundwater or other materials (including any testing or sampling for
Hazardous Substances, Hydrocarbons or NORM). Seller or Seller's designee shall
have the right to be present during any stage of the assessment. Buyer shall
give Seller reasonable prior written notice before gaining physical access to
any of the Conveyed Interests, and Seller or its designee shall have the right
but not the obligation to accompany Buyer and Buyer's Representatives whenever
Buyer and/or Buyer's Representative gain physical access to any Conveyed
Interests. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Buyer
shall not have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct any
inspections (including any Phase I Environmental Site Assessment) with respect
to, any Conveyed Interests with respect to which Seller does not have the
authority to grant access for such due diligence; provided that Seller shall
request access rights from Third Parties for Buyer to conduct such inspections
(including any Phase I Environmental Site Assessment) with respect to, such
Conveyed Interests.

(c) Buyer shall coordinate its access rights, environmental property
assessments and physical inspections of the Conveyed Interests with Seller and
all Third Party operators, as applicable, to minimize any inconvenience to or
interruption of the conduct of business by Seller or any such Third Party
operator. Buyer shall abide by Seller's, and any Third Party operator's,
safety rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Conveyed Interests, including any environmental or
other inspection or assessment of the Conveyed Interests and, to the extent
required by Seller or any Third Party operator, execute and deliver any access
and bonding agreement required by Seller or any such Third Party operator, in
each case before conducting Buyer's assessment on such Conveyed Interest in
accordance with this Section 4.1. Buyer hereby indemnifies, defends, and holds
harmless each of the operators of the Conveyed Interests and each Seller
Indemnified Party from and against any and all Liabilities arising out of,
resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental assessment or
other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative
with respect to the Conveyed Interests, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF
OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION
OF LAW BY, A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY
LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR 

WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SUCH OPERATOR OF THE CONVEYED INTERESTS OR A MEMBER
OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

(d) Buyer acknowledges that any entry into Seller's offices or onto the
Conveyed Interests shall be at Buyer's sole risk, cost and expense, and,
subject to the terms hereof, that none of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
be liable in any way for any injury, loss or damage arising out of such entry
that may occur to Buyer or any of Buyer's Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement. Buyer hereby fully waives and releases any and all Liabilities
against all of the Seller Indemnified Parties for any injury, death, loss or
damage to any of Buyer's Representatives or their property in connection with
Buyer's due diligence activities, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR
RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION
OF LAW BY, A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY
LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT
OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

(e) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller, but in no event less than five
days after receipt or creation thereof by Buyer or any of Buyer's
Representatives (including Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering
firm), copies of all final reports prepared by Buyer and/or any of Buyer's
Representatives, which contain data collected or generated from Buyer's and/or
any of Buyer's Representatives' due diligence with respect to the Conveyed
Interests, including all environmental and title reports. Seller shall not be
deemed by its receipt of said documents or otherwise to have made any
representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, as to the condition
of the Conveyed Interests or to the accuracy of said documents or the
information contained therein.

(f) Upon completion of Buyer's due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or any of its Affiliates (i)
repair all damage done to any Conveyed Interests in connection with Buyer's
and/or any of Buyer's Representatives' due diligence (including due diligence
conducted by Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm), (ii)
restore the Conveyed Interests to the approximate same condition as, or better
condition than, they were prior to commencement of any such due diligence, and
(iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Conveyed
Interests in connection with such due diligence. Any disturbance to the
Conveyed Interests (including the leasehold associated therewith) resulting
from such due diligence will be promptly corrected by Buyer at Buyer's sole
cost and expense.

(g) During all periods that Buyer and/or any of Buyer's Representatives
(including Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm) are on the
Conveyed Interests, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole cost and expense, and
with insurers reasonably satisfactory to Seller, policies of insurance of the
types and in the amounts reasonably requested by Seller. Coverage under all
insurance required to be carried by Buyer hereunder will (i) be primary
insurance, (ii) list the Seller Indemnified Parties as additional insureds,
(iii) waive subrogation against the Seller Indemnified Parties, and (iv)
provide for 15 days prior written notice to Seller in the event of
cancellation, expiration, or modification of the policy or reduction in
coverage. 

Upon request by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to
Seller prior to entering the Conveyed Interests.

4.2 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access
to the Records or the Conveyed Interests, Buyer and/or Buyer's Representatives
(including Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm) will become
privy to confidential and other information of Seller and/or Seller's
Affiliates and Buyer shall ensure that such confidential information (a) shall
not be used for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) shall be held confidential by Buyer and
Buyer's Representatives (including Buyer's environmental consulting or
engineering firm) in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. If the Closing should occur, the foregoing confidentiality
restriction on Buyer, including the Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate
as of the Closing Date (except as to (i) such portion of the Conveyed
Interests that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, (ii) the Excluded Assets, and (iii) information related to Seller,
Seller's Affiliates, or to any assets other than the Conveyed Interests).

ARTICLE V

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTIES; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

5.1 General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations. Except for the
special warranty of title set forth in the Assignments and the Mineral Deed,
and without limiting Buyer's remedies for Title Defects set forth in this
Article V, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to Seller's title to any of the 

Conveyed Interests, and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's sole
remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to
any of the Conveyed Interests (a) before Closing, shall be as set forth in
Section 5.3 and (b) from and after Closing, shall be pursuant to the
contractual special warranty of title set forth in the Assignments.

5.2 Special Warranty. The Assignments delivered at Closing will contain a
special warranty of title with regard to the Conveyed Interests whereby Seller
shall warrant Defensible Title to the Conveyed Interests unto Buyer against
every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part
thereof by, through or under Seller, but not otherwise, subject, however, to
the Permitted Encumbrances. The Mineral Deed delivered at Closing will contain
a special warranty of title with regard to the Conveyed Interests specified
therein whereby DEPCO shall warrant Defensible Title to such Conveyed
Interests unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to
claim the same or any part thereof by, through or under DEPCO, but not
otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances.

5.3 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.

(a) Title Defect Notices. On or before the Defect Claim Date, Buyer must
deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this Section
5.3(a) (collectively, the "Title Defect Notices" and, individually, a "Title
Defect Notice") setting forth any matters which, in Buyer's reasonable
opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title
Defect pursuant to this Section 5.3(a). For all purposes of this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer
fails to assert as a Title Defect by a properly delivered Title Defect Notice
received by Seller on or before the Defect Claim Date; provided, however,
that, for purposes of Seller's special warranty of title set forth in the
Assignments, such waiver shall not apply to any matter that, prior to the
Defect Claim Date, is neither reflected of record in the applicable counties
or in the applicable state or federal records nor discovered by any of Buyer's
or any of its Affiliates' employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title
examiners while conducting Buyer's due diligence with respect to the Conveyed
Interests. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and
shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Conveyed
Interest (including the legal description of such Conveyed Interest and the
Leases applicable to such Conveyed Interest), or portion thereof (including by
the currently producing formation or Target Formation as applicable), affected
by such alleged Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (ii) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title
Defect, (iv) Buyer's preferred manner of curing such Title Defect and Buyer's
proposed documentation for such cure and (v) the amount by which Buyer
reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is
reduced by such alleged Title Defect and the computations upon which Buyer's
belief is based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and
curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller,
on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date,
written notice of all alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims that would
be claims under the special warranty set forth in the Assignments) discovered
by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary
in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claim Date. Buyer shall also,
promptly upon discovery, furnish Seller with written notice of any Title
Benefit which is discovered by any of Buyer's or any of its Affiliates'
employees, title 

attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while conducting Buyer's due
diligence with respect to the Conveyed Interests prior to the Defect Claim
Date.

(b) Title Benefit Notices. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including
(1) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Conveyed Interest, or
portion thereof, affected by such alleged Title Benefit (each a "Title Benefit
Property"), and (2) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by such alleged
Title Benefit, and the computations upon which Seller's belief is based. Other
than any Title Benefits referred to in the Assignments and any Title Benefits
which Buyer is required to report to Seller pursuant to Section 5.3(a), Seller
shall be deemed to have waived any Title Benefit which Seller fails to assert
as a Title Benefit by a Title Benefit Notice delivered to Buyer on or before
the Defect Claim Date.

(c) Seller's Right to Cure. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure any properly asserted Title
Defects at any time prior to 180 days after the Closing Date (the "Cure
Period"). During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the Cure
Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller and its officers, employees and other
authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
the Conveyed Interests and all Records in Buyer's or any of its Affiliates'
possession in order to facilitate Seller's attempt to cure any such Title
Defects. No reduction shall be made to the Purchase Price with respect to any
Title Defect for which Seller has provided notice to Buyer prior to or on the
Closing Date that Seller intends to attempt to cure the Title Defect during
the Cure Period. An election by Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall
be without prejudice to its rights under Section 5.3(j) and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Seller's right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title
Defect.

(d) Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to Section 14.1(e), in the event that any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 5.3(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, Seller shall, at its sole option but
subject to Buyer's agreement in the case of the remedy described in Section
5.3(d)(iii), elect to:

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price or the Final Price, as applicable, by
the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant to Section 5.3(g) or Section
5.3(j);

(ii) retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all associated Conveyed Interests, or if the Title
Defect Property has been assigned to Buyer, have Buyer reassign to Seller,
with special warranty of title against claims by, through or under Buyer, but
not otherwise, the Title Defect Property that is subject to such Title Defect,
together with all associated Conveyed Interests, and, concurrently therewith,
the Purchase Price or the Final Price, as applicable, shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and such
associated Conveyed Interests; 

(iii) if and only if Buyer agrees to this remedy in its sole discretion,
indemnify Buyer against all Liability (up to the Allocated Value of the
applicable Title Defect Property) resulting from such Title Defect with
respect to such Title Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement
prepared by Seller in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer (a
"Title Indemnity Agreement"); or

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(e).

(e) Remedies for Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
reported under Section 5.3(b), the Purchase Price shall be increased by an
amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated
Value for such Title Benefit Property caused by such Title Benefit, as
determined pursuant to Section 5.3(h) or Section 5.3(j).

(f) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights under Seller's special
warranty of title in the Assignments delivered at Closing and Buyer's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(e), Section 5.3(d) shall be
the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Seller's failure to
have Defensible Title with respect to any Well, Well Location, or Lease or any
other title matter with respect to any Conveyed Interest, and Buyer hereby
waives any and all other rights or remedies with respect thereto.

(g) Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the "Title Defect Amount" for such Title Defect Property and shall be
determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions (without
duplication):

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property in Exhibit B, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set
forth for such Title Defect Property in Exhibit B;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an increase of (A) Seller's Working
Interest for any Title Defect Property over (B) the Working Interest set forth
for such Title Defect Property in Exhibit B, then the Title Defect Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Working Interest
increase and the denominator of which is the Work Interest set forth for such
Title Defect Property in Exhibit B;

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title 

Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; provided, however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable
of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the lesser
of (A) the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect and (B) the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property;

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

(h) Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions (without duplication):

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit B, then the
Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title
Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit B;

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a decrease of (A) Seller's Working
Interest for any Title Benefit Property over (B) the Working Interest set
forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit B, then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Working
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Work Interest set forth
for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit B; and

(iv) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property
affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the
potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title
Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

(i) Title Defect Threshold and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Seller hereunder for any individual Title
Defect for which the Title Defect 

Amount does not exceed $100,000 ("Individual Title Defect Threshold"); and
(ii) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller hereunder for any Title Defect for which the Title
Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the
amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all such Title
Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any
Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller or Title
Defect Properties retained by or reassigned to Seller, as applicable, pursuant
to Section 5.3(d)(ii)), plus (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all
Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but
excluding any Remediation Amounts attributable to Conveyed Interests subject
to Environmental Defects that are retained by Seller pursuant to Section
6.1(b)(ii) and any Environmental Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the
Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments
to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but
only to the extent that the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Title
Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For
the avoidance of doubt, if Seller elects to retain any Title Defect Property
or to have Buyer reassign any Title Defect Property pursuant to Section
5.3(d)(ii), the Title Defect Amount relating to the Conveyed Interest
attributable to such Title Defect Property will not be counted towards the
Aggregate Deductible and will not be considered for purposes of Section 10.4
or Section 11.4.

(j) Title Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on
matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts, and (ii) the adequacy of any curative materials
provided by Seller to cure any alleged Title Defect (collectively "Title
Disputes") prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by
Closing (or by the Title Dispute Date if Seller elects to attempt to cure an
alleged Title Defect after Closing), the Title Disputes shall be exclusively
and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 5.3(j). There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least 10 years' experience
in oil and gas titles involving properties in any of the regional areas in
which the Title Defect Properties or Title Benefit Properties, as applicable,
are located, in each case as selected by the mutual agreement of Buyer and
Seller within 15 days after Closing or the Title Dispute Date, as applicable
(the "Title Arbitrator"). If the Parties do not mutually agree upon the Title
Arbitrator in accordance with this Section 5.3(j), the Houston office of the
AAA shall appoint the Title Arbitrator under such conditions as the AAA in its
sole discretion deems necessary or advisable. The place of arbitration shall
be Houston, and the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA
Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section
5.3(j). The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within 30 days
after submission of Title Disputes and shall be final and binding upon both
Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination with respect to
any Title Dispute, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth
in Section 5.3(g) and Section 5.3(h) and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as, in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator, are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may
not award Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount
claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice. The Title Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
Title Disputes submitted by either Party, and the Title Arbitrator may not
award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title 

Arbitrator. To the extent the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to
any Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.6,
then within 10 days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to
Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Dispute, and, subject to
Section 5.3(i), (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded
by the Title Arbitrator to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein
shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration
that may be conducted pursuant to this Section 5.3(j), and, to the extent any
adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent adjustments to
the Purchase Price, if any, will be made pursuant to Section 3.7 or this
Section 5.3(j).

5.4 Casualty or Condemnation Loss.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Conveyed Interests, and Buyer shall not assert
such matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Conveyed Interests is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is
taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a "Casualty
Loss"), and the Closing thereafter occurs, Seller, at Closing, shall pay to
Buyer all sums actually paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of any
Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Conveyed Interests and shall
assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Seller's
right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and
other rights against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than
insurance claims, of or against any Seller Indemnified Party) arising out of
such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Conveyed Interests;
provided, however, that Seller shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall
assign to Seller) all right, title, interest and claims against Third Parties
for the recovery of Seller's costs and expenses incurred prior to Closing in
repairing such Casualty Loss and/or pursuing or asserting any such insurance
claims or other rights against Third Parties.

5.5 Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign.

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in Schedule
7.9, not later than 10 days after the Execution Date (and, with respect to
each Preferential Purchase Right that is not set forth in Schedule 7.9 but is
discovered by either Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing
Date, not later than five days after the discovery thereof), Seller shall send
to the holder of each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material
compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential
Purchase Right.

(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Conveyed Interest to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies, then the Conveyed Interest
subject to such Preferential 

Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Conveyed Interests to be assigned to
Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of such Conveyed
Interest affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Conveyed Interest (or portion
thereof) so excluded. Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any
Person exercising a Preferential Purchase Right prior to Closing. If such
holder of such Preferential Purchase Right thereafter fails to consummate the
purchase of the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) covered by such
Preferential Purchase Right on or before the end of the period of time for
closing such sale but no later than 180 days following the Closing Date, (A)
Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall purchase, on or before 10 days
following receipt of such notice, such Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof)
that was so excluded from the Conveyed Interests to be assigned to Buyer at
Closing, under the terms of this Agreement and for a price equal to the amount
by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to such
excluded Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof), and (C) Seller shall assign
to Buyer the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing
pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment.
If, as of Closing, the time for exercising a Preferential Purchase Right has
not expired and such Preferential Purchase Right has not been exercised or
waived, then the Conveyed Interest subject to such Preferential Purchase Right
shall be included in the Conveyed Interests to be assigned to Buyer at
Closing, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for complying with the terms of
such Preferential Purchase Right and shall be entitled to the proceeds, if
any, associated with the exercise of such Preferential Purchase Right.

(ii) All Conveyed Interests for which any applicable Preferential Purchase
Right has been waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable
Preferential Purchase Right has expired, in each case, prior to Closing, shall
be sold to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

(b) With respect to each Consent set forth in Schedule 7.4, Seller, not later
than 10 days after the Execution Date (and, with respect to each Consent that
is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either Party after the
Execution Date and before the Closing Date, not later than five days after the
discovery thereof), shall send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent
seeking such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 7.4 (or any
Consent that is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either
Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing Date) prior to Closing
and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (1) the assignment of the
Conveyed Interests affected thereby to Buyer to be void or (2) the termination
of a Lease under the express terms thereof or (B) a Consent requested by
Seller is denied in writing, then, in each case, the Conveyed Interest (or
portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained Consent shall be excluded from
the Conveyed Interests to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Conveyed Interest (or
portion thereof) so excluded. In the event that any such Consent (with respect
to a Conveyed Interest excluded pursuant to this Section 5.5(b)(i)) that was
not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within 180 days following the
Closing Date, then, within 10 Business Days after such Consent is obtained,
(x) Buyer shall purchase the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) that was
so excluded as a result of such previously un-obtained Consent and pay to
Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with
respect to the 

Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) so excluded and (y) Seller shall assign
to Buyer the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing
pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment.

(ii) If Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 7.4 (or any
Consent that is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either
Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing Date) prior to Closing
and (A) the failure to obtain such Consent would not cause (1) the assignment
of the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) affected thereby to Buyer to be
void or (2) the termination of a Lease under the express terms thereof and (B)
such Consent requested by Seller is not denied in writing by the holder
thereof, then the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) subject to such un-
obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing
as part of the Conveyed Interests and Buyer shall have no claim against, and
Seller shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such Consent.

(iii) Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed in Schedule 7.4 (and any
Consent that is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either
Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing Date); provided,
however, that neither Party shall be required to incur any Liability or pay
any money in order to obtain any such Consent. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer
agrees to provide Seller with any information or documentation that may be
reasonably requested by Seller and/or the Third Party holder(s) of such
Consents in order to facilitate the process of obtaining such Consents.

ARTICLE VI

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

6.1 Environmental Defects.

(a) Assertions of Environmental Defects. Buyer must deliver claim notices to
Seller meeting the requirements of this Section 6.1(a) (collectively the
"Environmental Defect Notices" and individually an "Environmental Defect
Notice") not later than the Defect Claim Date setting forth any matters which,
in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and which
Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this Section 6.1.
For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and
Seller shall have no liability for, any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails
to assert as an Environmental Defect by a properly delivered Environmental
Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the Defect Claim Date, with such
liabilities being "Buyer's Environmental Liabilities." To be effective, each
Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a
description of the matter constituting the alleged Environmental Condition
(including the applicable Environmental Law violated or implicated thereby)
and the Conveyed Interests affected by such alleged Environmental Condition,
(ii) the Allocated Value of the Conveyed Interests (or portions thereof)
affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of such alleged
Environmental Condition, and (iv) a calculation of the Remediation Amount
(itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is attributable to such
alleged Environmental Condition. Buyer's calculation of the Remediation Amount
included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable detail
the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental Condition that gives
rise to the 

asserted Environmental Defect and identify all assumptions used by Buyer in
calculating the Remediation Amount, including the standards that Buyer asserts
must be met to comply with Environmental Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article VI, the aggregate Remediation Amounts attributable to
the effects of all Environmental Defects upon any single Conveyed Interest
shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Conveyed Interest. Seller shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any asserted Environmental
Defect on or before the expiration of the Cure Period. No reduction shall be
made to the Purchase Price with respect to any asserted Environmental Defect
for which Seller has provided notice to Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date
that Seller intends to attempt to cure the asserted Environmental Defect
during the Cure Period. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing
and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to
give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect
Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by
Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in
nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claim Date.

(b) Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right
to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation
Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to Section 14.1(e), in the event that any Environmental Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 6.1(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured prior to Closing, Seller shall, at its sole option but
subject to Buyer's agreement in the case of the remedy described in Section
6.1(b)(iii), elect to:

(i) Subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount;

(ii) retain the entirety of the Conveyed Interest that is subject to such
Environmental Defect, together with all associated Conveyed Interests, in
which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Conveyed Interest and such associated Conveyed
Interests;

(iii) if and only if Buyer agrees to this remedy in its sole discretion, to
indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Environmental Defect
with respect to the Conveyed Interests pursuant to an indemnity agreement
prepared by Seller in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer
(each, an "Environmental Indemnity Agreement"); or

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(e).

If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses
attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to
such Environmental Defect and for all Liabilities with respect thereto and
Buyer's obligations with respect to the foregoing shall be deemed to
constitute Assumed Obligations.

(c) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 14.1(e), the provisions set forth in Section 6.1(b) shall
be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental
Defect with respect to any Conveyed Interest or other environmental matter. 

(d) Environmental Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price
or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect
for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $200,000 (the "Individual
Environmental Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustment
to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any
Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate
Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the
Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Remediation Amounts
attributable to any Environmental Defects cured by Seller and Conveyed
Interests retained by Seller pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(ii)) plus (2) the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to
Title Defects cured by Seller and Title Defect Properties retained by or
reassigned to Seller, as applicable, pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(ii)), exceeds
(B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available
hereunder, but only with respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount
of such Remediation Amounts and Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate
Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller elects to retain any
Conveyed Interest related to any Environmental Defect pursuant to Section
6.1(b)(ii), then (x) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such retained Conveyed Interest and (y) the Remediation Amount for
the Environmental Defect relating to such retained Conveyed Interest will not
be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible.

(e) Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree
on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing. If
Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects
and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 6.1(e). There shall be a
single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least 10
years' experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties in any of the regional areas in which the affected Conveyed
Interests are located, as selected by the mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller
within 15 days after the Closing Date (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). If the
Parties do not mutually agree upon the Environmental Arbitrator in accordance
with this Section 6.1(e), the Houston office of the AAA shall appoint such
Environmental Arbitrator under such conditions as the AAA in its sole
discretion deems necessary or advisable. The place of arbitration shall be
Houston, and the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA
Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section
6.1(e). The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall be made within 30
days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding
upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section
6.1 and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the
opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a
proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award
Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by
Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts submitted
by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the Environmental
Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear 

one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. To the
extent that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any
Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.6, then within ten 10 days after
the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of
his award with respect to any Remediation Amount, and, subject to Section
6.1(d), (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing
herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section 6.1(e), and, to the extent any
adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent adjustments to
the Purchase Price, if any, will be made pursuant to Section 3.7 or this
Section 6.1(e).

6.2 NORM, Asbestos, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the
Conveyed Interests have been used for exploration, development, and production
of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or
other substances or materials located in, on or under the Conveyed Interests
or associated with the Conveyed Interests. Equipment and sites included in the
Conveyed Interests may contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances.
NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment
located on the Conveyed Interests or included in the Conveyed Interests may
contain asbestos, NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM
containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come
in contact with various environmental media, including water, soils or
sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation,
removal, transportation, or disposal of any affected environmental media,
wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Conveyed
Interests. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
permitted to claim any Environmental Defect on the account of the presence of
NORM or asbestos-containing materials that are non-friable, unless and only to
the extent such presence of NORM or asbestos-containing materials that are
non-friable constitutes an Environmental Condition resulting in a violation of
Environmental Laws or to the extent such NORM or asbestos-containing material
is present on out of service surface equipment included in the Conveyed
Interests.

operate its property and to carry on its business as now conducted. Buyer is
duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign limited liability
company in all jurisdictions in which it carries on business or owns assets
and such qualification is required by Law except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a material adverse effect upon the ability of Buyer
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or perform its
obligations hereunder.

8.2 Authorization, Approval and Enforceability. Buyer has full power and
authority to enter into and perform this Agreement, the Transaction Documents
to which it is a party and the transactions contemplated herein and therein.
The execution, delivery, and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents have been duly and validly authorized and approved by
all necessary limited liability company action on the part of Buyer. This
Agreement is, and the Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party, when
executed and delivered by Buyer, will be the valid and binding obligations of
Buyer and enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,

such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 

8.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery, and performance by Buyer of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein will not (a)
conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the organizational or
other governing documents of Buyer or (b) result in a default or the creation
of any Encumbrance or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, license or other agreement to which Buyer is a
party or by which Buyer or any of its property may be bound or (c) violate any
Law applicable to Buyer or any of its property, except in the case of clauses
(b) and (c) where such default, Encumbrance, termination, cancellation,
acceleration or violation would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect upon the ability of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or perform its obligations
hereunder.

8.4 Consents. Except as described in Section 9.9, there are no consents or
other restrictions on assignment, including requirements for consents from
Third Parties to any assignment, in each case, that Buyer is required to

ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or perform its obligations hereunder.

8.7 Regulatory. Buyer (or, if applicable, its affiliate Linn Operating, Inc.)
is and hereafter shall continue to be qualified under Law to own and assume
operatorship of the Conveyed Interests in all jurisdictions where the Conveyed
Interests are located, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

operator. To the extent required by any Laws, Buyer has maintained, currently
has, and will hereafter continue to maintain, lease bonds, area-wide bonds or
any other surety bonds as may be required by, and in accordance with, all Laws
governing the ownership and operation of the Conveyed Interests and has filed
any and all reports necessary for such ownership and/or operation with all
Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over such ownership and/or
operation. To Buyer's Knowledge, there is no fact or condition with respect to
Buyer or its obligations hereunder that may cause any Governmental Authority
to withhold its unconditional approval of the transactions contemplated hereby
to the extent approval by such Governmental Authority is required by Law.

8.8 Financing. Buyer has, and Buyer shall have as of the Closing Date,
sufficient cash in immediately available funds with which to pay the Purchase
Price, consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. Buyer
expressly acknowledges that the failure to have sufficient funds shall in no
event be a condition to the performance of its obligations hereunder, 

and in no event shall the Buyer's failure to perform its obligations hereunder
be excused by failure to receive funds from any source.

purchase, ownership and operation of oil and gas properties and related

so evaluated, the merits and risks of the Conveyed Interests, Buyer's
acquisition, ownership, and operation thereof, and its obligations hereunder,

Interests, Buyer's acquisition, ownership, and operation thereof, and its
obligations hereunder. In making its decision to enter into this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer (i) has relied or
shall rely solely on its own independent investigation and evaluation of the
Conveyed Interests and the advice of its own legal, Tax, economic,
environmental, engineering, geological and geophysical advisors and the
express provisions of this Agreement and not on any comments, statements,
projections or other materials made or given by any representatives or
consultants or advisors of Seller or any Affiliates of Seller, and (ii) has
satisfied or shall satisfy itself through its own due diligence as to the
environmental and physical condition of and contractual arrangements and other
matters affecting the Conveyed Interests. Buyer has no knowledge of any fact
that results in the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of
Seller given hereunder.

8.10 Brokers' Fees. None of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates has incurred any
liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokers' or finders' fees relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents
for which Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates has or shall have any
responsibility.

defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will
acquire the Conveyed Interests for its own account and not with a view to a
sale, distribution, or other disposition thereof in violation of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder,

operations covered by the AFEs and other capital commitments described in
Schedule 7.12, (y) for actions taken in connection with emergency situations
or to maintain a Lease, and/or (z) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement
or as expressly consented to by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, withheld or conditioned),

(a) Seller shall, from and after the Execution Date until Closing:

types currently in force.

(b) Seller shall not, from and after the Execution Date until Closing:

properties comprising the Conveyed Interests with respect to which it is not
the operator, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of any other Working
Interest owner (including any operator) or any other Person who is not Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller shall not constitute a breach of the provisions of
this Section 9.1, and no action required by a vote of Working Interest owners
shall constitute such a breach so long as Seller has voted its interest in a
manner that complies with the provisions of this Section 9.1.

9.2 Successor Operator. Buyer acknowledges that it desires to succeed Seller
as operator of those Conveyed Interests or any portion thereof that Seller may
presently operate. 

Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that Seller does not covenant or warrant
that Buyer shall become successor operator of such Conveyed Interests. Seller
agrees, however, that, as to the Conveyed Interests it operates, it shall use

possible and permitted under any applicable joint operating agreement, Buyer
(through its affiliate Linn Operating, Inc.) as successor operator of such
Conveyed Interests effective as of Closing.

in the applicable statute of limitations), (a) retain the Records, (b) provide
Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective officers, employees and
representatives with access to the Records during normal business hours for
review and copying at Seller's expense, and (c) provide Seller, its Affiliates
and its and their respective officers, employees and representatives with
access, during normal business hours, to materials received or produced after
Closing relating to any indemnity claim made under Section 13.2 for review and

destroying any of the Records, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing in advance
of such destruction and provide Seller a reasonable opportunity to copy any or
all of such Records at Seller's expense.

9.5 Guarantees. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in order to cause Seller and
its Affiliates to be released, as of the Closing Date, from all guarantees,
including any performance bonds previously put in place by Seller, including

foregoing, if required by a counterparty to any Guarantee, Buyer shall, and,
if applicable, shall cause its Affiliates to, provide, effective as of the
Closing Date or such later date as may be required by such counterparty,
substitute guarantee or similar arrangements for all periods covered by the
Guarantees, which guarantee or similar arrangements shall (a) constitute a
type of security, and (b) be provided by a party whose creditworthiness is, in
each case, equivalent to or better than that required by the counterparty to
such Guarantee. In the event that any counterparty to any such Guarantee does
not release Seller or any of its Affiliates, then, from and after Closing,
Buyer shall indemnify Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, as applicable,
against all amounts incurred by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, as
applicable, under such Guarantee (and all costs incurred in connection with
such Guarantee) if applicable to the Conveyed Interests acquired by Buyer.

placed in escrow by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller pursuant to the 

Guarantees must be returned to Seller as soon as practicable and shall be
deemed an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder.

9.6 Knowledge of Breach. Buyer will notify Seller promptly and in reasonable
detail promptly after Buyer or any Affiliate or Buyer, or any of their
respective officers or representatives, obtains knowledge that any
representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement of Seller contained in
this Agreement is, becomes, or will be untrue, or has been or may be breached,
as applicable, in any material respect on or before the Closing Date.

9.7 Amendment to Schedules. Buyer agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall have the continuing right until the Closing Date to add, supplement or
amend the Schedules to its representations and warranties with respect to any
matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or known on the
Execution Date or thereafter, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all purposes
of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Article X have been fulfilled and whether Seller owes
Buyer an indemnity under Article XIII, the Schedules to Seller's
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include only that information contained therein on the Execution Date and
shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement or amendment thereto; provided, however, that if Closing shall
occur, then all matters disclosed pursuant to any such addition, supplement or
amendment at or prior to the Closing Date that arose in the ordinary course of
business shall be waived and Buyer shall not be entitled to make a claim with
respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise.

(b) Schedule 9.8 sets forth a list of employees, or field personnel of or
under contract to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to whom Buyer shall offer
employment to be effective as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date (or with
respect to any individual on Schedule 9.8 who is on a leave of absence,
effective as of 12:01 A.M. on such later date as such individual is released
to return to work or is entitled to be restored to employment). Each offer of
employment must be made no later than 21 Business Days after the Execution

compensation, and (iii) participation in employment benefit plans and
arrangements that are, in each case for a period of at least 12 months after

provided to such individual immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) In the event that any individuals on Schedule 9.8 become employed by a
Third Party acquiring any of the Assets from Buyer in connection with such
acquisition, Buyer 

shall obtain from such Third Party at the closing of such acquisition a
written agreement by such Third Party to comply with the provisions of this
Section 9.8 with respect to such individuals. Such written agreement shall be
in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller and shall expressly permit Seller to
rely on its provisions. In the event that all of the terms and conditions of
this Section 9.8(c) are satisfied, Buyer shall be released from its
obligations under Section 9.8(b) with respect to the individual(s) hired by
the Third Party.

with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than 10 Business Days, after the Execution
Date, Seller and Buyer shall request early termination of the HSR Act waiting
period on the Notification and Report Form, and Seller and Buyer shall bear
their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such filings,
provided that Buyer shall pay any filing fees in connection therewith, and (b)
use their commercially reasonable efforts to respond at the earliest
practicable date to any requests for additional information made by the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Authority, to take all
actions necessary to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
Laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date, to resist in good
faith, at each of their respective cost and expense, any assertion that the
transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation of Laws, and to
eliminate every impediment under any Laws that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible in accordance herewith, all to the end of expediting
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with this
Section 9.9, the Parties shall, to the extent permitted by Laws, (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing, submission,
investigation or inquiry, (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any

or the FTC or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case, regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall

submitted to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, any other Person, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) consult with
each other in advance of any meeting, discussion, telephone call or conference
with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the

Authority or person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences, in each case, regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby.

financial information relating to the Conveyed Interests (the "Financial

pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and that such Financial
Statements may be required to be audited. In that regard, Seller shall provide
Buyer reasonable access to such records (to the extent such information is
available) and personnel of Seller as Buyer may reasonably request to enable
Buyer, and its representatives and accountants, at Buyer's sole cost and
expense, to create and audit any Financial Statements that Buyer deems

required to create new records relating to the Conveyed Interests and (ii) the

interfere with Seller\'s ability to prepare its own financial statements or
its regular conduct of business and shall be made available during Seller\'s
normal business hours.

(b) Seller shall consent to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of the
Financial Statements in any registration statement, report or other document
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to be filed with the SEC in which Buyer or
such Affiliate reasonably determines that the Financial Statements are
required to be included or incorporated by reference to satisfy any rule or
regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under the
Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Upon
request of Buyer, Seller shall request the external audit firm that audits the
Financial Statements (the "Audit Firm") to consent to the inclusion or
incorporation by reference of its audit opinion with respect to the audited
Financial Statements in any such registration statement, report or other
document. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide

letters provided by Seller to Seller\'s independent accountants.

STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED

13.6 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, from and after Closing, Sections 4.1(c), 9.5, 13.2 and 13.3,
the Assignments and any Title Indemnity Agreement or Environmental Indemnity
Agreement entered into by the Parties contain the Parties' exclusive remedies
against each other with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any document or
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Except as specified in

Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, hereby releases, remises and forever discharges Seller and its
Affiliates and all of such Persons' equityholders, partners, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, and representatives from any
and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
losses, costs, Liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever, at Law or
in equity, known or unknown, which Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties
might now or subsequently have, based on, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the ownership, use
or operation of any of the Conveyed Interests prior to Closing or 

the condition, quality, status or nature of any of the Conveyed Interests
prior to Closing, including rights to contribution under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
and any similar Environmental Law, breaches of statutory or implied
warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common
law rights of contribution and rights under insurance maintained by Seller or
any of its Affiliates (except as provided in Section 5.4).

13.7 Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under Sections
4.1(c), 9.5, 13.2 and 13.3 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of Section 4.1(c), Section 9.5 and this Article XIII, the
term "Indemnifying Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities
shall mean the Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify another
Party and/or other Person(s) with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to
Section 4.1(c), Section 9.5 or this Article XIII, and the term "Indemnified
Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the
Party and/or other Person(s) having the right to be indemnified with respect
to such Liabilities by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 4.1(c),
Section 9.5 or this Article XIII.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Sections 4.1(c), 9.5, 13.2 or
13.3, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
its claim under this Section 13.7, including the specific details of and
specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third
Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has
actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all
papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that
the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as
provided in this Section 13.7(b) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations under Sections 4.1(c), 9.5, 13.2 or 13.3 (as applicable)
except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available
to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party
Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to
defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice
to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall
deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to defend and indemnify
the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and
obligation to diligently defend and indemnify, at its sole cost and expense,
the Indemnified Party against such 

Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate
in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, at its own
expense, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 13.7(d). An Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle
any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto which does not include an unconditional written release of the
Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or
(ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party
Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle such
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right
of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for 10
days following receipt of such notice to i) admit in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the liability and consent to
such settlement, ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable
judgment, the proposed settlement, or iii) deny liability. Any failure by the
Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice shall be deemed to be an election
under subsection (i) above.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its liability for
such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30-day
period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for
such Liabilities, the amount of such Liabilities shall conclusively be deemed
a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

13.8 Survival.

(a) Except for the Specified Representations, the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 7.13 and the special warranty of title
included in the Assignments, the representations and warranties of Seller in
Article VII and Buyer in Article VIII and the covenants and agreements of the
Parties in Section 9.1 and Section 12.4, shall in each case terminate on the
date that is nine calendar months from the Closing Date. The Specified
Representations shall survive Closing without time limit. The representations
and warranties set forth in Section 7.13 shall survive until 30 days after the
expiration of the period of time set forth in the statute of limitations. The
special warranty of title included in the Assignments shall survive for the
period set forth in the Assignments. Subject to the foregoing and as set forth
in 

Section 13.8(b), the remainder of this Agreement shall survive Closing without
time limit. Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of
no further force or effect after the date of their expiration, provided that
there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

(b) The indemnities in Sections 13.2(a), 13.2(b), 13.3(a) and 13.3(b) shall
terminate as of the termination date of each respective representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification. Seller's
indemnities set forth in Section 13.2(c) shall survive the Closing for a
period of three years from the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i)
Seller's indemnities set forth in Section 13.2(c) relating to the portions of
the Specified Obligations defined in item (i) of Section 13.1(b) shall survive
until 30 days after the expiration of the period of time set forth in the
statute of limitations regarding same and Seller's indemnities set forth in
Section 13.2(c) relating to the portions of the Specified Obligations defined
in item (iv) of Section 13.1(b) shall survive without time limit. Buyer's
indemnity set forth in Sections 4.1(c), 9.5 and 13.3(c) shall survive the
Closing without time limit and shall be deemed covenants running with the
Conveyed Interests (provided that Buyer and its successors and assigns shall
not be released from any of, and shall remain jointly and severally liable to
the Seller Indemnified Parties for, the obligations and Liabilities of Buyer
under such Sections of this Agreement upon any transfer or assignment of any
Conveyed Interest). Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no
termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to the indemnities in
Sections 13.2(a) and 13.2(b) or Sections 13.3(a) through 13.3(c) prior to the
date of termination for such indemnity.

13.9 Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or Buyer,
or their respective Affiliates, any indirect, consequential, punitive,
exemplary, remote or speculative damages or damages for lost profits of any
kind arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent any such Party suffers such damages
to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages)
shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of the Seller Indemnified Parties,
waive any right to recover punitive, special, indirect, exemplary, or
consequential damages, remote or speculative, or damages for lost profits of
any kind, arising in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

13.10 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that,
following Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this
Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any other claim
arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation,
following Closing, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.11 Insurance. The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in
connection with or 

with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
reduced by any corresponding insurance proceeds from insurance policies
carried by Buyer realized or that could reasonably be expected to be realized
by Buyer if a claim were properly pursued under the relevant insurance
arrangements.

13.12 Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute
relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE XIV

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

14.1 Right of Termination. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

(a) by the mutual prior written consent of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if Closing has not occurred on or before
September 30, 2014 (or such later date as agreed to in writing by Seller and
Buyer);

(c) by Seller, at Seller's option, if any of the conditions set forth in
Article XI have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date;

(d) by Buyer, at Buyer's option, if any of the conditions set forth in Article
X have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date and, following written
notice thereof from Buyer to Seller specifying the reason such condition is
unsatisfied (including any breach by Seller of this Agreement), such condition
remains unsatisfied for a period of 10 Business Days after Seller's receipt of
written notice thereof from Buyer; or

(e) by Buyer if the condition set forth in Section 10.4 has not been satisfied
on or before the Closing Date or by Seller if the condition set forth in
Section 11.4 is not satisfied on or before the Closing Date;

provided, however, that neither Party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Sections 14.1(b) through (d) above if such Party or its
Affiliates are, at such time, in material breach of this Agreement.

14.2 Effect of Termination. If the obligation to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of
Section 14.1 hereof, then, except for the provisions of Article I, Sections
4.1(c) through 4.1(g), 4.2, 4.3, 9.8, 13.9, this Section 14.2, Section 14.3,
Article XV (other than Sections 15.2(b), 15.7, and 15.8) and such of the
defined terms in Appendix I to give context to the surviving provisions, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and the Parties shall have no liability
or obligation hereunder except and to the extent such termination results from
the material breach by a Party of any of its covenants or agreements hereunder
in which case the other Party shall have the right to seek all remedies
available at law or in equity, including specific performance, for such
material breach and shall 

be entitled to recover court costs and attorneys' fees in addition to any
other relief to which such Party may be entitled.

14.3 Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. Upon termination of this
Agreement, Buyer shall destroy or return to Seller all title, engineering,
geological and geophysical data, environmental assessments and/or reports,
maps and other information furnished by or no behalf of Seller to Buyer or
prepared by or on behalf of Buyer in connection with its due diligence
investigation of the Conveyed Interests, in each case, in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement and, if Buyer elects to destroy any such
information, an officer of Buyer shall certify the destruction of such
information to Seller in writing.

ARTICLE XV

MISCELLANEOUS

15.1 Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules. All of the Appendices, Exhibits and
Schedules referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and constitute a part of this Agreement. Each Party to
this Agreement and its counsel has received a complete set of Appendices,
Exhibits and Schedules prior to and as of the execution of this Agreement.

15.2 Expenses and Taxes.

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Parties in negotiating this Agreement or in
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the Party incurring the same, including legal and accounting fees, costs and
expenses.

(b) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes for any period or
portion thereof ending prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer shall be
allocated and bear all Asset Taxes for any period or portion thereof that
begins at or after the Effective Time. Each Party shall be responsible for its
own Income Taxes.

(c) For purposes of Section 15.2(b), (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to
the severance or production of Hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the period
in which the severance or production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred,
(ii) Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts or
imposed on a transactional basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in
clause (i)), shall be allocated to the period in which the transaction giving
rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem,
property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period
ending immediately prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs and
the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the date on which the
Effective Time occurs by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of
days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in such
Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause (iii) of the preceding
sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall begin on the date on which
ownership of the 

applicable Conveyed Interests gives rise to liability for the particular Asset
Tax and shall end on the day before the next such date.

(d) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not determinable at the
Closing or at the time of the determination of the Final Settlement Statement
pursuant to Section 3.6, as applicable, (i) the Parties shall utilize the most
recent information available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for
purposes of such adjustment, and (ii) upon the later determination of the
actual amount of such Asset Tax, timely payments will be made from one Party
to the other to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of
such Asset Tax that is allocable to such Party under Section 15.2(b). Buyer
shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns
and the payment to the applicable Taxing Authority of all Asset Taxes that
become due and payable on or after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall indemnify
and hold Seller harmless for any failure to file such Tax Returns and to make
such payments; except Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all ad
valorem, real property and personal property taxes for the Straddle Period on
Conveyed Interests operated by Seller, provided that Buyer shall reimburse
Seller for any such Taxes that are allocated to Buyer pursuant to Section
15.2(b).

(e) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances or
other instruments required to convey title to the Conveyed Interests to Buyer
shall be borne by Buyer. Any and all sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary,
registration or similar Taxes incurred or imposed with respect to the
transactions described in this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
shall be borne by Buyer, provided that Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to
the applicable Governmental Authorities any Transfer Taxes that it is required
by law to collect and remit. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless
from and against such Transfer Taxes within thirty (30) days of Seller\'s
written demand therefor. If Seller (not Buyer) is required by applicable law
to appeal or protest the assessment of Transfer Taxes, the appeal or protest
of such proposed assessment shall be treated as an item for which Seller is
entitled to indemnification and if Buyer provides a written request and
instructs Seller to do so, Seller shall prosecute the protest or appeal; in
such event Buyer shall pay all out-of-pocket expenses of Seller (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller in connection with such appeal or protest.
Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the
extent permissible under applicable law, the amount of any such Transfer
Taxes.

(f) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Conveyed Interests. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
another Party's request) the provision of records and information that are
relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Conveyed Interests relating to any Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective Tax periods and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority. 

15.3 Assignment. Subject to the provisions of Section 15.19, this Agreement
may not be assigned by Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller;
provided, however, at any time prior to three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer may, by written notice to Seller, direct Seller to assign
Buyer's interest in this Agreement or all or a portion of the Conveyed
Interests and Assumed Obligations to one or more Affiliates of Buyer. Such
assignment shall not relieve Buyer of any obligations and responsibilities
hereunder, including obligations and responsibilities arising following such
assignment. Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer or its successors and
assigns of any of the Conveyed Interests shall not relieve Buyer or its
successors or assigns of any of their obligations (including indemnity
obligations) hereunder, as to the Conveyed Interests so assigned or
transferred.

15.4 Preparation of Agreement. Both Seller and Buyer and their respective
counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the identity
of the draftsman of this Agreement.

15.5 Publicity. Seller and Buyer shall promptly consult with each other with
regard to all press releases or other public or private announcements issued
or made at or prior to Closing concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein, and, except as may be required by applicable Laws or the
applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or stock
exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue any such press release or other
public or private announcement without the prior written consent of the other
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS OR THE STATE COURTS
LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS FOR ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE

DOCUMENTS OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY SHALL BE
EXCLUSIVELY LITIGATED IN SUCH COURTS DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVING SITES IN HOUSTON,
TEXAS AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS
SOLELY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR ANY
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THAT A FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT AGAINST A
PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING CONTEMPLATED ABOVE SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND
MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

(WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY (I) WAIVES SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND (II) SUBMITS TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF ANY

contrary, each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-Person claim of any
kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to the
Agreement or the Debt Financing, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under the applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the

Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). Each of the
Parties hereto irrevocably agrees to waive trial by jury in any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-Person claim referred to in this
paragraph.

15.15 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

15.16 Removal of Name. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within 60
days after the Transition Period or such earlier time as may be required by
applicable Law, Buyer shall eliminate the names "Seller" and any variants
thereof from the Conveyed Interests and, except with respect to such grace
period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos,
trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

15.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.

15.18 Several Liability of Seller. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the obligations of Seller under this Agreement shall be
shared severally, and not jointly, by DEPCO and Devon Uinta to the extent of
their respective interests in the Conveyed Interests relevant to the
obligation in question. As an example, if an indemnity obligation of Seller
under Section 13.2 relates only to Conveyed Interests owned by Devon Uinta,
Devon Uinta alone would be responsible for 100% of such indemnity obligation.
As another example, if an indemnity obligation of Seller under Section 13.2
relates 70% to Conveyed Interests owned by DEPCO and 30% to Conveyed Interests
owned by Devon Uinta, DEPCO would be responsible for 70% of such indemnity
obligation and Devon Uinta would be responsible for 30% of such indemnity
obligation.

15.19 Like-Kind Exchange. Buyer and Seller agree that either or both of Seller
and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the Conveyed Interests
as an exchange of like-kind property under Section 1031 of the Code (an
"Exchange"), provided that the Closing shall not be delayed by reason of the
Exchange. Each Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
other Party in the completion of such an Exchange including an Exchange
subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(k)-1 and/or
Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign all or a part of
its rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that term is
defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an exchange
accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service
Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect an Exchange. In connection with any such
Exchange, any 

exchange accommodation titleholder shall have taken all steps necessary to own
the Conveyed Interests under applicable Law. Each Party acknowledges and
agrees that neither an assignment of a Party's rights under this Agreement nor
any other actions taken by a Party or any other Person in connection with the
Exchange shall release either Party from, or modify, any of its liabilities
and obligations (including indemnity obligations to the other Party) under
this Agreement, and neither Party makes any representations as to any
particular Tax treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by reason of
such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange.
Either Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the Conveyed
Interests as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional costs
incurred hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for the
cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment shall
agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold
the other Party, its Affiliates, and their respective former, current and
future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
liabilities and Taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the
Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the
electing Party's Exchange election.

15.20 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed by a Party in accordance with their specific
terms, the other Party shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity.

15.21 Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to
the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), (a) no
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Financing Source, agent, attorney, advisor or
representative or Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement, in their
respective capacities as such, and (b) no past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Financing
Source, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing, in their respective capacities as such, shall have any liability
(whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more Seller or Buyer under this Agreement (whether
for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim based on, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the Debt Financing.
