fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, without par value, of the

(ii) _Excluded Shares_. Each share of Company Capital Stock owned by the
Company (or held in the Companys treasury) or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or

to the Effective Time represented any such outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the

interest.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, all unvested
Company Options shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the

Effective Time. Company Options will not be continued, assumed or substituted
for by the Company or Parent as part of the Merger. At the Effective Time,
each then-outstanding Company Option shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive, for each Company Option, the Amount Per Share _less_ the

Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or cause to be
paid, the Option Merger Consideration to the Surviving Corporation in

Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail Parents calculation of (i)

set forth in the Estimated Closing Date Statement shall be binding on Parent
and Parent shall be deemed to have agreed to the accuracy of the Estimated
Closing Date Statement as true, complete and accurate and Parent shall not
have any right to object with respect to and may not disagree with any of the
items included in the Estimated Closing Date Statement.

(b) _Closing Date Statement Preparation_. Parents preparation of the
Closing Date Statement shall be for the sole purpose of determining
differences between (x) the Estimated Closing Date Cash, the Estimated Closing
Date Indebtedness, the Estimated Transaction Expenses, the Estimated Net
Working Capital and the resulting calculation of the Estimated Merger
Consideration, on one hand and (y) the Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, Net Working Capital and the resulting
calculation of the Merger Consideration, on the other hand, which each shall
be determined on a consolidated basis using the Accounting Principles. The
Parties further agree that neither Party shall permit the introduction of
different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
preparing, reviewing or disputing the Closing Date Statement other than the
Accounting Principles.

 

(c) _Disputes_.

 

(i) If the Equityholder Representative objects to Parents calculation of
the Merger Consideration, including the amount of Closing Date Cash, Closing
Date Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, or Net Working Capital, as set forth
in the Closing Date Statement, then, within forty-five (45) days after the
delivery to the Equityholder Representative of the Closing Date Statement
(the " _Review Period_ "), the Equityholder Representative shall deliver to
Parent a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") describing in reasonable
detail the Equityholder Representatives objections to Parents calculation
of the amounts set forth in such Closing Date Statement and containing a
statement setting forth the Equityholder Representatives calculation of the
amount of the Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses, Net Working Capital and the resulting calculation of the Merger
Consideration. If the Equityholder Representative does not deliver a Dispute
Notice to Parent during the Review Period, then the calculations set forth in
the Closing Date Statement shall be binding on the Equityholder Representative
and each of the Company Equityholders and the Equityholder Representative, on
behalf of the Company Equityholders, shall be deemed to have agreed to the
accuracy of the Closing Date Statement as true, complete and accurate and the
Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Company Equityholders, shall not
have any right to object with respect to and may not disagree with any of the
items included in the Estimated Closing Date Statement.

(ii) During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of a
Dispute Notice by the Equityholder Representative to Parent, Parent and the
Equityholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the disputed
portions of the Closing Date Statement as specified in such Dispute Notice.
Any disputed items resolved in writing between Parent and the Equityholder
Representative within such thirty (30) day period shall be binding and
conclusive on the Parties. If Parent and the Equityholder Representative have
not resolved all such differences by the end of such thirty (30) day period,
then Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall jointly engage a
mutually agreeable independent nationally or regionally recognized accounting
firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve any items remaining in dispute
(and only such items), it being understood

 



22

    

 that the Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an expert and not as an
arbitrator and shall not have any authority to interpret any provision of this
Agreement. Within ten (10) days after the Accounting Firm is appointed,
Parent shall forward a copy of the Closing Date Statement to the Accounting
Firm, and the Equityholder Representative shall forward a copy of the Dispute
Notice to the Accounting Firm, together with, in each case, all relevant
supporting documentation. The Accounting Firms role shall be limited to
resolving such objections and determining the correct calculations to be used
on only the disputed portions of the Closing Date Statement (including
any dispute with respect to the timeliness of delivery or receipt of any
Dispute Notice), and the Accounting Firm shall not make any other
determination, including any determination as to whether any other items on
the Closing Date Statement are correct. The Accounting Firm shall not assign
a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
the Equityholder Representative or Parent or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by the Equityholder Representative or Parent and shall be
limited to the selection of either the Equityholder Representatives or
Parents position on a disputed item (or a position in between the positions
of the Equityholder Representative and Parent) based solely on presentations
and supporting material provided by Parent and Equityholder Representative and
not pursuant to any independent review. In resolving such objections, the
Accounting Firm shall apply the provisions of this Agreement
concerning determination of the amounts set forth in the Closing Date
Statement, including the definition of the Merger Consideration contained
herein (and the definitions of the defined terms contained therein). The
Accounting Firm shall deliver to the Equityholder Representative and Parent a
written determination (such determination to be made in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(b)_ and include a work sheet setting forth all material
calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on
information provided to the Accounting Firm by the Equityholder Representative
and Parent) of the disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm within
thirty (30) days of receipt of such disputed items. The determination by the
Accounting Firm of the disputed amounts and the resulting calculation of the
Merger Consideration shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent
manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for
such determination shall be borne by the Equityholder Representative, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the manner
in which such Person prevails on the items resolved by the Accounting Firm,
which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis
based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be
computed by the Accounting Firm at the time its determination of the items in
dispute is rendered. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount
to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Equityholder
Representatives position, 60% of the costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm would be borne by Parent and 40% would be borne by the Equityholder
Representative. The Merger Consideration, as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Merger
Consideration_ ".

 

(iii) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be positive or negative, shall
be equal to (A) the Final Merger Consideration minus (B) the Estimated Merger
Consideration.

(d) _Payment of Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then within five (5)
Business Days after the final determination of such amount, Parent shall pay
to the Payment Administrator, for further payment to the Company Shareholders,
each Company Shareholders Pro Rata Share of the Adjustment Amount.

 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then within five (5)
Business Days after the final determination of such amount (the " _Parent
Adjustment Amount_ "), Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing it to
disburse to Parent from the NWC Escrow Fund, cash equal to the Parent
Adjustment Amount (or, if the Parent Adjustment Amount exceeds the NWC Escrow
Amount, then cash equal to the NWC Escrow Amount). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Equityholder Representative, 

 



23

    

 the Key Shareholders, the other Company Equityholders and their respective
Affiliates and representatives shall not have any Liability to Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates for any portion of the Parent
Adjustment Amount that is in excess of the NWC Escrow Amount. Recovery of cash
from the NWC Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Holdings, Parent, the Company and any of its or their respective Affiliates
for any claims arising out of or relating to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(d)_, and
none of Holdings, Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
shall have any claim against the Equityholder Representative, the Key
Shareholders, the other Company Equityholders or their respective Affiliates
or representatives in respect thereof. Any portion of the NWC Escrow Amount
that is not distributed to Parent as part of the Parent Adjustment Amount
shall be distributed in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.10(c)_.

(e) Parent agrees that the adjustments to the Estimated Merger
Consideration and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.9_ shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed
herein.

 

(f) The Parties agree that any payments pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.9_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for
federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 

(g) _Cooperation_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in
_Sections_ _2.8_ and  _2.9_ , each of Parent and the Equityholder
Representative shall cooperate with each other and make available to the other
Party, the other Partys representatives and the Accounting Firm all
information, records, data and working papers, and shall permit access to its
facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Closing Date Statement and the resolution of
any disputes thereunder.

 

2.10 _Payment Administrator; Payment Procedures; Escrow Agreement_.

 

(a) _Payment Administrator_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall, at
its sole cost and expense, designate a Acquiom Financial LLC (or another
payments administrator reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as
payments administrator in the Merger (the " _Payment Administrator_ "),
pursuant to an agreement in customary form that requires the Payment
Administrator to comply with the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.10_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Payment
Administrator, for payment through the Payment Administrator in

Closing Cash Payment. The Payment Administrator shall cause the Closing Cash
Payment to be: (A) held for the benefit of the applicable Company
Shareholders immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) applied
promptly to making the payments to such Company Shareholders as required by
the terms hereof. The Closing Cash Payment shall not be used for any other
purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) Prior to, or promptly following, the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Payment Administrator to, deliver to each Company Shareholder (pursuant to
contact information provided by in the Capitalization and Payment

form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , which shall include (A) a release of
claims against the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub,
(B) confirmation of the Equityholder Representative as the agent of such

or destroyed certificate (in customary form without a bond requirement) for
any Person claiming a Certificate representing Company Capital Stock has been
lost, stolen, destroyed or is

 



24

    

 otherwise not available to be surrendered to the Payment Administrator (a "
_Lost Certificate Affidavit_ "), and (E) be in such form and have such other
reasonable provisions not inconsistent with this Agreement. Promptly
following receipt by the Payment Administrator of a duly executed Transmittal
Letter by a Company Shareholder and all documents required therein (including
the surrender of Certificates or a Lost Certificate Affidavit, if
applicable), the Payment Administrator shall promptly deliver, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts specified by
such Company Shareholder, the consideration that such Company Shareholder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, in each case without
interest thereon. Until so surrendered, each Certificate outstanding after the
Effective Time will be deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter,
to evidence only the right to receive the consideration that such Company
Shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (without
interest). No portion of the consideration that such Company Shareholder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ will be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall have either (X) surrendered such Certificate to the
Payment Administrator; or (Y) in the event such Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen, destroyed or is otherwise not available for surrender to the
Payment Administrator, executed and delivered to the Payment Administrator the
Lost Certificate Affidavit, in each case together with a Transmittal Letter
to the Payment Administrator, and, upon satisfaction thereof, such Company
Shareholder shall be entitled to receive the consideration that such Company
Shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_
(without interest).

(ii) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by a Certificate are
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that: (A) any Certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer; (B) the Transmittal Letter delivered to the Payment Administrator
shall be properly executed and otherwise in proper form; and (C) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the Person in whose name the shares of Company
Capital Stock are registered, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Payment Administrator that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(iii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of shares of
Company Capital Stock on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, a request for the transfer of shares of Company
Capital Stock or any Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof,
which shall be in customary form without a bond requirement) is presented to
the Payment Administrator the relevant shares of Company Capital Stock shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.6_ and this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_. The payment of the consideration that
such Company Shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.6_ shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Capital Stock.

 

(iv) Any portion of the Closing Cash Payment that remains undistributed to
the Company Shareholders twelve (12) months after the Closing Date will be
promptly delivered to Parent by the Payment Administrator along with any and
all earnings thereon, and any applicable Company Shareholders shall look only
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for satisfaction of any claims for its
right to receive the consideration payable in respect of the applicable shares
of Company Capital Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(iii)_. Any
portion of the Closing Cash Payment that remains undistributed immediately
prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of the Payment
Administrator, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be liable to any
Company Shareholder for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



25

Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub, (B) confirmation of the Equityholder

(C) an agreement that such holder shall receive its portion of the Option
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __

entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation, and shall be paid by the

ARTICLE 8

_GENERAL COVENANTS_

8.1 _Books and Records; Access_. Following the Closing, except as
necessary to comply with applicable Law (as reasonably determined by the
Company in good faith) or preserve the attorney-client privilege, other legal
privilege or contractual confidentiality obligation, Parent shall provide the
Equityholder Representative and its representatives with reasonable access to
and/or copies of all documents, books, records, agreements, and financial data
relating to the business of the Company for any bona fide purpose under this
Agreement during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice,
including its review of the Closing Date Statement. Unless otherwise consented
to in writing by the Equityholder Representative, Parent shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation not to, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books
and records of the Surviving Corporation for any period prior to the Closing
Date without first giving reasonable prior written notice to the
Equityholder Representative and offering to surrender to the Equityholder
Representative such books and records or any portion thereof which Parent or
any of its Affiliates may intend to destroy or dispose of.

 

8.2 _Post-Closing Employment_.

 

(a) During the six (6) month period following the Effective Time, Holdings
and Parent shall take, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take, all
actions required so that all individuals who are employed by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who intend to continue their
employment with Holdings, Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time (including employees on vacation, leave of absence, or short or
long-term disability) (the " _Post-Transaction Employees_ "): (i) receive base
compensation and bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than that
provided immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided, that there is no
obligation to continue any option plans or equity-based compensation); and
(ii) receive benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and (iii) receive severance pay that is no less than the severance pay
that would have been payable under the severance policy or any agreement with
such employee in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Holdings and Parent shall take, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to take, all actions required so that all Post-
Transaction Employees shall receive service credit for all purposes under any
employee benefit plans and arrangements in which they participate following
the Effective Time. To the extent that Holdings, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation modifies any coverage or benefit plans under which the Post-
Transaction Employees participate, Holdings, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall waive any applicable waiting periods, pre-existing
conditions or actively-at-work requirements and shall give such employees
credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for deductibles, co-insurance
and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid during the year in which such
coverage or plan modification occurs. Holdings and Parent shall be solely
responsible for any obligations arising under Section 4980B of the Code with
respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9).

(c) For a period of ninety (90) days following the Effective Time,
Holdings and Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not
to, terminate any Post-Transaction Employees in such numbers as would trigger
any liability under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of

Holdings and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
comply with any notice or filing requirements under the WARN Act and any
similar state or local Law occurring on or after the Effective Time.

 



59

    

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, whether express or
implied, will be construed to (i) confer upon any Person any rights to
employment or continued employment or any term or condition of employment for
any period with Parent, (ii) limit the ability of the Company, Holdings,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract or arrangement at
any time assumed, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by any of them,
or (iii) confer upon any Person who is not a Party, including any employee of

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall survive the Effective Time and shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of Holdings, Parent and the Company.

8.3 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless all current and former directors,
officers, and employees of the Company (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_")
against any Losses incurred in connection with any Action, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), in each case in their capacities as such
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under
indemnification agreements existing on the date hereof or the organizational
or governing documents of the Company in effect on the date hereof, to
indemnify such DandO Indemnified Persons. From and after the Effective Time,
except as required by changes in Law, the Surviving Corporation shall not
amend, repeal or modify any provision of any indemnification agreements
existing on the date hereof or any provision in the Surviving Corporations
organizational or governing documents relating to the indemnification of the
DandO Indemnified Persons, in each case in a manner that would limit the scope
of such indemnification.

(b) At the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, maintain
and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" or comparable insurance policies naming
the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at
least six (6) years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with an
A.M. Best Rating of A or better with respect to directors liability insurance
in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall not, and Holdings and Parent
shall not authorize or permit the Surviving Corporation to, cancel or amend
such insurance policies in any respect adverse to the DandO Indemnified
Persons.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns: (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then Holdings, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation to assume all of the obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be released from such obligations.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are intended for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person and his
or her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have had, under applicable Law, by Contract or otherwise.

8.4 _Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy_. Holdings and Parent
have obtained the RandW Insurance Policy bound effective on and as of the date
hereof, a copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ (the " _R andW
Insurance Policy_"), and Holdings and Parent have paid or shall pay all fees,
costs and expenses (including all premium amounts) related to the RandW
Insurance Policy. Holdings and Parent shall cause the RandW Insurance Policy to
expressly include a waiver by the insurer of any and all subrogation rights
against the Company Shareholders, other than with respect to Fraud. Holdings
and Parent shall cause each insured party under the RandW Insurance Policy not
to waive, amend, modify or otherwise revise the RandW Insurance Policy in a
manner that is adverse to the Company without the prior written consent of
the Equityholder Representative. Holdings and Parent have delivered evidence
of the binding of the RandW Insurance Policy as of the date hereof.

 

8.5 _Release_.

 

(a) In consideration for the Merger Consideration, as of and following the
Closing Date, each Key Shareholder (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
knowingly, voluntarily and unconditionally releases, forever discharges, and
covenants not to sue Holdings, Parent or their respective Affiliates
(including the Company) from or for any and all claims, causes of
action, demands, suits, debts, obligations, liabilities, damages, losses,
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) of every kind or nature
whatsoever, known or unknown, actual or potential, suspected or unsuspected,
fixed or contingent, that such Key Shareholder has or may have, now or in the
future, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from any act or omission,
error, negligence, breach of contract, tort, violation of law, matter or cause
whatsoever from the period of time prior to the Closing Date and relating to
the operation of the business of the Company or the ownership of the Company
Capital Stock (each, a " _Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing release will not apply to (i) any rights or Claims arising out of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (ii) if such Key Shareholder is an
employee of the Company, any rights or Claims relating to such Key
Shareholders employment with the Company, including such Key Shareholders
right to receive any compensation he has earned as an employee of the Company
and such Key Shareholders rights and benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan
in which he is a party or in which he participates; or (iii) if such Key
Shareholder is a DandO Indemnified Person, such Key Shareholders right to
exculpation, indemnification, advancement, reimbursement of expenses or
coverage in his capacity as a DandO Indemnified Person under the Articles
of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or any insurance policy or indemnification
agreement, including any policy obtained pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_
of this Agreement (other than with respect to any claim against such
Key Shareholder for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3 of this
Agreement).

(b) Each Key Shareholder (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby
expressly agrees that the release contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_
extends to any and all rights granted under Section 1542 of the California
Civil Code or any analogous state law or federal law or regulation are hereby
expressly waived. Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (" _Section_ __ _
1542_") reads as follows:

 

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING
PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF
EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY
AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY."

 

(c) Each Key Shareholder understands that Section 1542, or a comparable
statute, rule, regulation or order of another jurisdiction, gives such party
the right not to release existing claims of which such party is not aware,
unless such party voluntarily chooses to waive this right. Having been so
apprised, Key Shareholder (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
nevertheless hereby voluntarily elects to and does

 



61

    

 waive the rights described in Section 1542, or such other comparable
statute, rule, regulation or order, and elects to assume all risks for claims
that exist, existed or may hereafter exist in its favor, known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, arising out of or related to claims or other matters
purported to be released pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, in each case,
effective upon the Closing Date. Each Key Shareholder (on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waiver is an
essential and material term of this Agreement and that, without such waiver,
Parent would not have agreed to the terms of this Agreement. Each Key
Shareholder (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby represents to
Holdings and Parent that it understands and acknowledges that it may hereafter
discover facts and legal theories concerning Holdings, Parent and their
Affiliates (including the Company) and the subject matter hereof in addition
to or different from those which it now believes to be true. Each Key
Shareholder understands and hereby agrees that the release set forth herein
shall remain effective in all respects notwithstanding those additional or
different facts and legal theories or the discovery of those additional or
different facts or legal theories. Each Key Shareholder (on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates) assumes the risk of any mistake of fact or applicable law
with regard to any potential claim or with regard to any of the facts that are
now unknown to it relating thereto.

 

8.6 _Post-Closing Confidentiality_. Following the Closing, each of the Key
Shareholders hereby agrees that he shall, and shall cause his Affiliates and
representatives to, protect and keep confidential all confidential and
proprietary information of, and relating to, the Company (the " _Confidential
Information_ ") and shall not, directly or indirectly, use or disclose such
Confidential Information for any purpose (other than as authorized in his
capacity as an officer or employee of the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates following Closing). Confidential Information shall not include any
information that is or becomes generally publicly known other than as a result
of disclosure by the Key Shareholders (or their Affiliates or representatives)
in breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Key
Shareholder may make disclosure of Confidential Information if he reasonably
concludes, based upon the written advice of counsel, that disclosure of
Confidential Information is required by applicable Law, in which case he shall
(i) provide Holdings and Parent with written notice of such proposed
disclosure, in reasonable detail, as far in advance of such disclosure as
reasonably practicable, (ii) cooperate reasonably with Holdings and Parent in
their efforts to protect the information from disclosure, including, without
limitation, assisting such Persons or their Affiliates in obtaining, at the
Holdings and Parents expense, an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information and (iii) limits disclosure to the minimum required by applicable
Law unless Holdings and Parent agree in writing to a greater level of
disclosure.

 

8.7 _Exclusive Dealings_. From the date hereof until the Closing or the
earlier termination of this Agreement, neither the Key Shareholders nor the
Company shall, and each such Person shall cause their respective Affiliates
and representatives not to, take any action to solicit, knowingly encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
information to, enter into any agreement with, or furnish any confidential
information to any Person (other than Holdings and Parent and their
Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of the Companys Capital Stock or
any merger, sale of substantial assets, or similar transaction involving the
Company or the Business (each, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "). Company and
Key Shareholders shall cease, and cause their respective Affiliates and
representatives to cease, and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Holdings
and Parent and their Affiliates) conducted prior to or on the date hereof with
respect to any Acquisition Transaction. In the event that the Key
Shareholders or Company or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives receives an Acquisition Transaction proposal after the date
hereof but prior to Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement,
Company and Key Shareholders shall provide Holdings and Parent with prompt
written notice thereof, which notice shall include the terms of, and the
identity of the Person or Persons making such Acquisition Transaction
proposal.

intention of the Parties that the survival periods and expiration and
termination dates set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ supersede any
applicable statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply to the subject
matter of such sections. The Parties further acknowledge that the time
periods set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ for the assertion of claims
under this Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation among the
Parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by
the Parties.

severally indemnify and hold harmless all Company Shareholders, all Affiliates

9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Order of Recovery_. The Parent Parties source of payment or
indemnification for any claims under this Agreement shall be (subject in all

_ 9.4(c)_):

 

(i) In the case of Losses arising pursuant to (x) _ Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(d)_ or (y) _ Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ or _Section_ __
_ 9.3(c)_ (solely to the extent also covered by _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(d_)):

(A) First, if the Indemnity Escrow Amount held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund has not been released in full, then from the Indemnity Escrow Amount up
to the amount of the RandW Policy Retention Amount;

 

(B) Second, if the Indemnity Escrow Amount held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund is released in full prior to satisfaction of the RandW Policy Retention
Amount, from the Key Shareholders, on a joint and several basis and subject to
the limitations in this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, for the amount, if any, by which
the RandW Policy Retention Amount exceeds the Indemnity Escrow Amount then
available to the Parent Parties as a source of payment or indemnification
under _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(i)_; and

 

(C) Third, from the RandW Insurance Policy until the coverage thereunder has
been exhausted.

 



64

    

(ii) In the case of Losses arising pursuant to (x) __ _ Section_ __ _
9.3(e) _or (y) _ Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_ (to the

solely from the Indemnity Escrow Amount held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

 

(b) _Cap_. Except for Actions arising out of or related to Fraud:

 

(i) the aggregate liability of the Company Shareholders (including the Key
Shareholders) under  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a_) and _Section_ __ _ 9.3(d)_
shall be limited to an amount equal to the RandW Policy Retention Amount;

 

(ii) the aggregate liability of the Company Shareholders (including the Key

_Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_ shall be limited to an amount equal to the Indemnity
Escrow Amount.

 

(iii) other than the Key Shareholders, in no event shall the Company
Shareholders be obligated to indemnify the Parent Parties under _Section_ __
_ 9.3_ from any source other than the Indemnity Escrow Fund;

 

(iv) the aggregate liability of any Key Shareholder under _Section_ __ _
9.3_ shall not exceed such Key Shareholders Fully-Diluted Pro Rata Share of
the Final Merger Consideration; and

(v) the aggregate liability for Holdings and Parent under _Section_ __ _
9.2_ shall not exceed the Final Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Recovery_. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, as applicable, will be
reduced by the amount of insurance or indemnification proceeds or other
amounts actually recovered from other sources (net of any fees, costs
and expenses related to the recovery of such payment, including deductibles,
retrospective premium adjustments, experience-based premium adjustments and
indemnification obligations) by such Indemnified Party, and promptly following
receipt thereof, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the Indemnifying Party
any such amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party from the other
source of recovery. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be compensated more than once for the
same Loss. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, (i) this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)_ shall not modify or otherwise
impact the order of recovery set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ of this
Agreement and (ii) for recoveries under the RandW Insurance Policy, (A) an
Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to remit any amounts recovered
thereunder to the Indemnifying Party and (B) assuming compliance with the
order of recovery set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_, the amount of Loss
subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ shall not be
reduced by recoveries under the RandW Insurance Policy.

9.5 _Materiality_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, all of the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or any words of similar import shall be deemed to have been
made without any such qualification for purposes of determining (i) the
amount of Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to any breach of a
representation or warranty and (ii) whether any such breach has occurred;
_provided_ ,  _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not
apply to the use of "Material" in the defined terms "Material Contract" or
"Material Adverse Effect."

 

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties agree that, from and after the
Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties for any
monetary Losses based upon or arising out of the matters set forth in this
Agreement (other than for claims of, or causes of action arising from, Fraud
or the matters described in _Section_ __ _ 2.9 _or arising under the
Restrictive Covenant Agreements or the Parent

 



65

    

 Operating Agreement) are the obligations of the parties set forth in this
_ARTICLE 9_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ will not, however,
prevent or limit a cause of action (a) under _Section_ __ _ 12.16_ to obtain
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, or (b) under  _Section_
__ _ 2.9_ to enforce any decision or determination of the Accounting Firm.

Indemnified Party to mitigate any Losses as required under applicable Law
with respect to which it is seeking indemnification hereunder.

9.8 _Adjustments to Merger Consideration; Manner of Payment_. All
indemnification payments made pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ will be treated as

Parent shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing it to disburse to such Parent Party, from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, the lesser of (i) the amount of such Losses and (ii) the then remaining
balance of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. Any other indemnification payments to
be made pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within five (5) Business Days after the final determination thereof an
account designated by the Indemnified Party.

9.9 _R andW Insurance Policy_.

 

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, none of Holdings, Parent nor Merger Sub
shall be entitled to recover against the Company or any Company Shareholders
for any Liability or Loss arising solely as a result of any non-issuance,
termination, expiration, amendment and/or modification of, or the denial of
any claim by the insurer for any reason or no reason under, the RandW Insurance
Policy.

(b) In no event shall the RandW Insurance Policy be deemed to constitute a
part of this Agreement or be integrated with this Agreement, and in no event
shall the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy have any right to bring a
claim against the Company or any Company Shareholder under this Agreement
(other than subrogation rights in the case of Fraud). In no event shall the
Company or any Company Shareholder be responsible for the issuing insurance
companys failure to pay any claim made by any of the Parent Parties under
the RandW Insurance Policy.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
limitations or exceptions set forth in this _ARTICLE 9_ , including any
survival periods with respect to the representations, warranties and covenants
set forth herein, shall in any way limit or modify the ability of the Parent
Parties to make claims under, or recover under, the RandW Insurance Policy.

9.10 _Procedure_.

 

(a) If any Person who or which is entitled to seek indemnification under
_ARTICLE_ __ _ 10_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or _9.3_ (an " _Indemnified Party_
") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any Third Party Claim
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Person against whom
or which such indemnification is being sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party will give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof;  _provided_ , that if a Parent Party is the Indemnified Party,
notice shall be delivered to the Equityholder Representative and the
Equityholder Representative shall control the decisions of the Indemnifying
Party under this  _Section_ __ _ 9.10_. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
will describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies
of any complaint, petition or any other pleading received in connection with
such Third Party Claim and all available material written evidence thereof,
and

 



66

    

 will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Losses
that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party will have the right to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense, or at its option (subject to the
limitations set forth in this _ Section_ __ _ 9.10_) to assume the defense
thereof by appointing a recognized and reputable counsel to be the lead
counsel in connection with such defense; _ provided_, _ however_, that:

 

(i) The Indemnifying Party must give the Indemnified Party written notice
of its election to assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim
within ten (10) days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of the
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party disclaims any liability in
connection with such matter, the Indemnifying Party shall give the
Indemnified Party written notice of such disclaimer of liability within ten
(10) days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of the Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party timely disclaims any Third Party
Claim, whether in full or in part, then the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith for a period of twenty (20) Business Days from the date the Indemnified
Party receives such objection (such period is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Third Party Claim_ ___Negotiation Period_ "). After the Third Party Claim
Negotiation Period, if the Parties still cannot agree on such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party may only assume such defense if (i) the
Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will have
adequate financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and
fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (ii) the Third Party Claim
involves only monetary damages and does not seek an injunction, other
equitable relief or criminal liabilities against the Indemnified Party, (iii)
the maximum amount of monetary damages and related costs and expenses which
could be payable with respect to such Third Party Claim does not exceed the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim hereunder, (iv) the Third Party Claim is not made by any Governmental
Authority or a customer or supplier of the Company, and (v) the Indemnified
Party has not been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in
connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim.

(iii) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim and to employ a recognized and reputable
counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees
and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party.

 

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party unless the terms of such
settlement or compromise (i) call only for a payment to the Indemnified Party
(or of the Third Party Claim directly), the full amount of which is
indemnified hereunder, (ii) does not impose an injunction or other equitable
relief upon the Indemnified Party, (iii) does not require an admission or
acknowledgment of fault by the Indemnified Party and (iv) contains
an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim.
If the Indemnifying Party shall not have elected to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim within ten (10) days of receipt of the written notice
described in  _Section_ __ _ 9.10(a)(i)_, or is otherwise not entitled to
assume such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its
option, to do so in such manner as it deems appropriate. In the event any
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party and its counsel
in contesting any Third Party Claim or, if appropriate and related to the
Third Party Claim in question, in making any reasonable counterclaim against
the Person making such Third Party Claim, or any cross complaint against any
Person (other than the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates) or similar
action.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying
Party may only investigate, contest, defend or settle any Third Party Claim if
the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy is not entitled, or if entitled
does not elect, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(b) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Losses that does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted by
giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof;
_provided_ , that if a Parent Party is the Indemnified Party, notice shall be
delivered to the Equityholder Representative and the Equityholder
Representative shall control the decisions of the Indemnifying Party under
this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe
the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all available
material written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of Liabilities that have been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of ten (10)
Business Days from which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not respond within such ten (10) Business Day period,
the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party rejects (or is deemed to have rejected) any Direct Claim,
whether in full or in part, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith for
a period of twenty (20) Business Days from the date the Indemnified
Party receives such objection or is deemed to have rejected such Direct Claim
(such period is hereinafter referred to as the " _Negotiation Period_ ").
After the Negotiation Period, if the parties still cannot agree on the claim,
the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party.

(c) A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified
information in any notice as provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.10(a)_ or _9.10(b)_
will not affect the rights or obligations of any Party, except and only to the
extent that, as a result of such failure, any Party that was entitled to
receive such notice was deprived of its right to recover any payment under its
applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Third Party Claims with respect to
Taxes shall be addressed in the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.7
_herein.

ARTICLE 10

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

10.1 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, including
the provisions under _Section_ __ _ 10.7_. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such filing of Tax Returns,
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Parties agree: (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to
any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by any Party, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority; and (ii) to give
the other Parties reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if any other Party so requests,
each Party shall allow the other Parties to take possession of such books and
records.

 



68

    

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_ or _Section_ __ _
10.4_, on the Closing Date or after the Closing Date, none of Holdings,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates shall: (A) file
or permit to be filed or amend or otherwise modify, or permit to be amended
or otherwise modified, any Tax Return for any period beginning on or prior to
the Closing Date; (B) discuss, correspond, negotiate, make or initiate any
voluntary contact with any Governmental Authority or representative thereof
with respect to, or settle with any Governmental Authority or representative
thereof, any Tax liability of the Company with respect to any period beginning
on or prior to the Closing Date or that may affect the Tax liability of
Company Shareholders for any period; (C) extend or waive, or cause to be
extended or waived, any statute of limitations or other period for the
assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to any period beginning on or
prior to the Closing Date; or (D) make any Tax election (including an
election under Section 338 of the Code or any similar provision under state,
local or foreign Law) that has retroactive effect to any period or portion of
any period beginning on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case, except as
required by Law or with the prior written approval of the Equityholder
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

 

(c) Tax Returns for the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including
any Straddle Period) that are first required to be filed after the Closing
Date shall be prepared by the Companys Accountants, all costs and expenses of
which shall be paid by the Equityholder Representative from the Equityholder
Representative Reserve (to the extent of funds available) and then paid by
the Key Shareholders to the extent that the Equityholder Representative
Reserve is not sufficient to cover such costs, and shall be subject to the
approval of Parent and Equityholder Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Except as required by
applicable Tax Law or this Agreement, any such Tax Return shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with those previously filed by the Company prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties agree that, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, all Transaction Deductions shall be treated
as arising in the Pre-Closing Tax Period. For the avoidance of doubt, all
estimated tax payments or prepaid income Taxes paid by the Company prior to
Closing for the current Tax year shall be applied as a credit to the
applicable Tax Return for such Taxes. Holdings and Parent shall not, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, waive any carryback of a net
operating loss of the Company generated in a Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided,
however, that none of Holdings, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
have any obligation to carry back any Tax losses or credits that arise in any
post-Closing period. The Parties shall, to the extent permitted or required
under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the Tax
period of the Company for all Tax purposes, and Holdings and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to join the "consolidated group" (as defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-1(h)) that includes Parent effective on
the day after the Closing Date. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
due date of any income Tax Return subject to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_
(and fourteen (14) days prior to the due date for any other Tax return subject
to this _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_), a copy of the Tax Return proposed to be
filed shall be delivered to Parent and the Equityholder Representative for
their review and comment. In the event of any dispute between Holdings and
Parent, on the one hand, and the Equityholder Representative, on the other
hand, concerning such a Tax Return, the decision of the Companys Accountants
shall be final and binding on the Parties, absent manifest error.

(d) The Parties further agree, upon request, to use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Company Shareholders
or Parent (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby);
_provided_ , however, that all costs related to obtaining such certificates or
other documents under this  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(d)_ shall be paid by the
Equityholder Representative from the Equityholder Representative Reserve (to
the extent of funds available) and then paid by the Key Shareholders to the
extent that the Equityholder Representative Reserve is not sufficient to
cover such costs.

 



69

    

10.2 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be borne by Parent and paid when due, and Parent shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes.

 

10.3 _Tax Refunds_. The Company Equityholders shall be entitled to any Tax
refunds or credits that are received by Holdings, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their Affiliates attributable to Taxes paid by the
Company prior to the Closing Date, including, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any estimated Taxes paid by the Company prior to Closing. Holdings
and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid over to (i) the Payment
Administrator, for further payment to the Company Shareholders, each Company
Shareholders Fully-Diluted Pro Rata Share of any such refund or the amount
of any such credit less the amount of the employer portion of any Taxes
payable on account of the payments to the Company Optionholders pursuant to
subsection (ii) of this sentence; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation, the
balance of such credit or refund for payment to the Company Optionholders
(and payment of Taxes with respect thereto), in each case within 30 days after
actual receipt of such refund (or credit in lieu of such refund) or actual
realization of such credit against Taxes. Following the Surviving
Corporations receipt of such refund or credit, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay or cause to be paid through its payroll system to each Company
Optionholder that has timely returned a Stock Option Cancellation Agreement
to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(v)_, (A) that Company
Optionholders Fully-Diluted Pro Rata Share of the refund or credit, _less_
(B) that portion of the refund or credit otherwise payable to such Company
Optionholder that is required to be withheld from such Company Optionholder
under applicable Tax withholding laws. Neither Holdings nor Parent shall
request a credit in lieu of a refund with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Periods. Further, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
Holdings, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to
carry back any items that arise in any post-Closing period and the Company
Equityholders shall have no right to refunds resulting from the carryback of
deductions or losses in periods after Closing. All costs of requesting Tax
refunds with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be paid by the
Equityholder Representative from the Equityholder Representative Reserve (to
the extent of funds available) and then paid by the Key Shareholders to the
extent that the Equityholder Representative Reserve is not sufficient to
cover such costs. In no event shall any Tax refunds be payable under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ with respect to any amounts that were taken into account
as assets or receivables in the calculation of Estimated Net Working Capital
and Net Working Capital pursuant to _Sections_ _2.8(a)_ and _2.8(b)_.

 

10.4 _Carrybacks_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns
under  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall elect to
carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit from the Pre-Closing Tax
Period, including any Transaction Deductions, to prior Tax years to the
fullest extent permitted by Law (using any available short-form or accelerated
procedures (including filing IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding form for
applicable state, local and foreign Tax purposes) and filing amended
Tax Returns to the extent necessary) and to obtain any potential Tax refunds
or claims related thereto; _provided_ , however, that all costs related to
carry backs, amended Tax Returns, and all other costs arising under this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.4_ shall be paid by the Equityholder Representative from
the Equityholder Representative Reserve (to the extent of funds available) and
then paid by the Key Shareholders to the extent that the
Equityholder Representative Reserve is not sufficient to cover such costs.

10.5 _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_. For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Taxes payable for a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall in the case of any
(i) Taxes other than gross receipts, value added, sales or use Taxes and
Taxes based upon or related to income or payments, be deemed equal to the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period

 



70

    

 and (ii) Tax based upon or related to income or payments and any gross
receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date.
The costs and expenses of preparing any Tax Return for a Straddle Period shall
be allocated in the same proportion as the Taxes payable with respect to such
Tax Return.

 

10.6 _Tax Treatment of Additional Payments to Company Shareholders_. Any
additional payments to the Company Shareholders pursuant to _Sections_ _10.3_
shall be treated by the Parties as increases to the amount paid to the Company
Shareholders for their Equity Interests in the Company to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 

10.7 _Audits_.

 

(a) Parent shall promptly provide the Equityholder Representative with
written notice of any inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments
by the IRS or any other taxing authority, which relate to any Pre-Closing Tax
Periods within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notice. The
Equityholder Representative shall have the sole right to represent the
interests of the Company in any Tax audit or other Action or proceeding
relating to Taxes in any Pre-Closing Tax Periods, to employ counsel of
its choice at its own expense, and to settle any issues and to take any other
actions in connection with such proceedings relating to such taxable periods;
_provided_ that the Equityholder Representative shall inform the Parent of the
status of any such proceedings, shall provide the Parent (at the Parents
cost and expense) with copies of any pleadings, correspondence, and other
documents as the Parent may reasonably request and shall consult with the
Parent prior to the settlement of any such proceedings and shall obtain the
prior written consent of the Parent prior to the settlement of any such
proceedings that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Parent
or the Company in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date, which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed; _provided_
further that the Parent and counsel of their own choosing shall have the right
to participate in, but not direct, the prosecution or defense of such
proceedings at the Parents sole expense.

(b) Parent shall have the right to control all other Tax audits or Actions
or proceedings of the Company. Parent shall obtain the prior written consent
of the Equityholder Representative prior to the settlement of any such
proceedings that could reasonably be expected to increase the
Company Shareholders Tax Liability for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or result in
indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(d)_, which consent shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

agreements contained in this Agreement); (ii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed by written notice to Parent that all conditions set forth in

Law claim, controversy or dispute) that apply to agreements made and performed
entirely within the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law
provisions thereof or of any other jurisdiction. Each Party agrees and
acknowledges that the application of the Laws of the State of Delaware is
reasonable and appropriate based upon the Parties respective interests
and contacts with the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties waives any right
or interest in having the Laws of any other state, including specifically,
state law regarding the statute of limitation or other limitations period,
apply to any Partys state Law claim, controversy or dispute which in any way
arises out of or relates to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

12.8 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Prevailing Party; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Subject to the alternative dispute mechanisms expressly set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_ and  _ARTICLE 10_ , each Party irrevocably agrees
that any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and each such Party shall not bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid court), and each
Party hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for itself
and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each Party hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any such Action: (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named court for any reason other than
the failure to lawfully serve process; (ii) that it or its property is exempt
or immune from jurisdiction of such court or from any legal process commenced
in such court (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment 

 



75

    

 or otherwise); and (iii) that (A) such Action in any such court is brought
in an inconvenient forum; (B) the venue of such Action is improper; and (C)
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the subject matter
hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such court.

 

(b) In the event any Action is commenced by any Person (the " _Claiming
Party_ ") to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other Person
(the " _Defending Party_ "), if the Defending Party is the prevailing party in
such Action, all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and court costs, incurred by the Defending Party in such Action will be
reimbursed by the Claiming Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Defending Party prevails in part, and loses in part, in such Action, the
court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such Action will award
a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Defending
Party on an equitable basis; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Defending Party
is deemed to have prevailed by virtue of claims being voluntarily reduced,
the equitable adjustment shall take into account the proportion of the amount
of Losses actually paid relative to the amount of Losses alleged or sought.
For purposes hereof, and without limitation, the Defending Party will
be deemed to have prevailed in any Action described in the immediately
preceding sentence if the Claiming Party commences any such Action and: (i)
such underlying claim(s) are subsequently dropped or voluntarily dismissed or
voluntarily reduced; and/or (ii) the Defending Party defeats any such
claim(s).

(c) TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED,
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER
AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM
IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE OR ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION OR SUIT (IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT
OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH PARTY
HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO THAT
THIS SECTION 12.8(c) CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THEY ARE
RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 12.8(c) WITH ANY COURT
AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

12.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may
be amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by Parent and the Equityholder
Representative (after the Closing) or the Parent and the Company (prior to
the Closing). The waiver by a Party of any breach hereof or default in the
performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by
the Parties as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 12.9_ at any time before or
after adoption of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders, but, after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires the further
approval of the Company Shareholders without obtaining such further approval.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent may,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party; (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, in each
case, made by the other Party; and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Any agreement on the part
of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any
Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such rights preclude any other or further

 



76

    

 exercise thereof. No such waiver or extension shall be effective unless
signed in writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is
asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof
shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to
enforce such provisions, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
rights preclude any other or further exercise thereof.

 

12.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any
term, provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, illegal, void,
unenforceable or against regulatory policy, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

12.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all fees, costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors, brokers, finders, investment bankers and
accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees, costs and
expenses.

 

12.12 _Construction; Mutual Drafting_. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

12.13 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and
Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof.

 

12.14 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules shall be subject to
the following terms and conditions: (a) the disclosures in any section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed or to
qualify, as applicable, all other sections or subsections of the Disclosure
Schedules for which applicability of such information and disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face; (b) where the representations and warranties
in this Agreement contain specific dollar threshold items, disclosures listed
in response thereto may include items that are below such dollar threshold
and no disclosure of any matter contained in the Disclosure Schedules shall
create an implication that such matter meets any standard of materiality; (c)
matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited
to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure
Schedules and such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature, nor
shall the inclusion of any item be construed as implying that any such item
is "material" for any purpose; (d) any disclosures contained in the Disclosure
Schedules which refer to a document are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the text of such document, a true and complete copy of which was
included in the Evaluation Material provided or made available to Holdings,
Parent or Merger Sub; (e) no reference in the Disclosure Schedules to any
agreement or document shall be construed as an admission or indication by any
party to this Agreement to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including
that such agreement or document is enforceable or currently in effect or that
there are any obligations remaining to be performed or any rights that may be
exercised under such agreement or document, except as otherwise explicitly set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules or this Agreement (e.g., _Schedule
3.15(b)_); (f) no disclosure relating to any possible breach or violation of
any agreement, Law or regulation shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred;
(g) headings and introductory language 

 



77

    

 have been inserted on the sections of the Disclosure Schedules for
convenience of reference only and shall to no extent have the effect of
amending or changing the express description of the sections as set forth in
this Agreement; (h) Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed to have
knowledge of all disclosures contained in the Disclosure Schedules; (i) the
sections of the Disclosure Schedules are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the provisions of this Agreement, and are not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations of the Parties except as and to the
extent provided in this Agreement; (j) unless otherwise defined herein or
unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Schedules have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement, and
(k) any reference to a section number in the Disclosure Schedules refers to
that section of this Agreement unless the context otherwise is reasonably
apparent.

 

12.15 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with regard to all dates
and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

12.16 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed as required by their
specific terms or were to be otherwise breached, irreparable damage will occur
to the other Parties, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would
be difficult to determine. It is accordingly agreed that Holdings and Parent,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by
the other (as applicable) and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. No Party shall oppose, argue, contend or
otherwise be permitted to raise as a defense that an adequate remedy at law
exists or that specific performance or equitable or injunctive relief
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason with
respect to any breach of this Agreement. The Parties further agree that: (i)
by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 12.16_, a Party
shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that
may be available to a Party under this Agreement (including monetary damages)
in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 12.16_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted; and (ii) nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 12.16_
shall require any Party to institute any Action for (or limit any Partys
right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this _Section_
__ _ 12.16_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_ARTICLE 11_ (or pursuing damages prior to or after such termination), nor
shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.16_
or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.16_ restrict or limit any
Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_ARTICLE 11_ or to pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter. If any Party brings any Action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by: (A) the amount of
time during which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days; or
(B) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
Action.

12.17 _Equityholder Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment; Authority_. For purposes of this Agreement, each Company
Equityholder shall, without any further action on the part of any such
Company Equityholder, be deemed (by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, such Company Equityholders execution of a Transmittal Letter, and/or
such Company Equityholders acceptance of any consideration paid pursuant to
this Agreement) to have consented to the appointment of the Equityholder
Representative as the representative and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of
such Company Equityholder, with full power of substitution, to act in the
name, place and stead of such Company Equityholder for purposes taking any and
all actions and making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by
the Equityholder Representative under or contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, including the exercise of the power to: (i) execute
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and any other agreements, documents
and certificates pursuant to

 



78

    

 such agreements, including all amendments to such agreements, and take all
actions required or permitted to be taken under such agreements; (ii) resolve,
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, claims in
connection with this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement; (iii) receive and
forward notices and communications pursuant to this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement; and (iv) take all other actions necessary, desirable or
appropriate in the judgment of the Equityholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and any other
agreements, documents and certificates pursuant thereto. Michael Scobey hereby
accepts his appointment as the Equityholder Representative. All decisions,
actions, consents and instructions of the Equityholder Representative shall
be final and binding upon all the Company Equityholders, and no Company
Equityholder shall have any right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same, except for fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct.

(b) _Replacement_. The Company Equityholders entitled to at least a
majority of the Merger Consideration can appoint a new Equityholder
Representative by written consent and by sending notice and a copy of the duly
executed written consent appointing such new Equityholder Representative to
Parent. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by Parent.

 

(c) _Expenses and Liabilities_. Any fees, costs, expenses or Liabilities
incurred by the Equityholder Representative in connection with the
performance of its duties under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
shall not be the personal obligation of the Equityholder Representative but
shall be payable by and attributable to the Company Shareholders (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share). The Equityholder
Representative may from time to time submit invoices to the Company
Shareholders covering such fees, costs, expenses or Liabilities and, upon the
request of any Company Equityholder, shall provide such Company Equityholder
with an accounting of all fees, costs, expenses or Liabilities paid.

 

(d) _No Liability_. Neither the Equityholder Representative nor any agent
employed by the Equityholder Representative shall incur any Liability to any
Company Equityholder relating to the performance of his duties hereunder
except for actions or omissions constituting fraud, bad faith or willful
misconduct. The Equityholder Representative shall not have by reason of this
Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Company Equityholder,
except in respect of amounts actually received on behalf of such Company
Equityholder. The Equityholder Representative shall not be required to
make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.

 

(e) _Equityholder Representative Reserve_. The Equityholder Representative
Reserve shall be available to the Equityholder Representative: (i) as a
source of recovery for any fees, costs, expenses or Liabilities incurred by
the Equityholder Representative in connection with the performance of his
duties under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; and (ii) as a source
of payment for any amounts owed by the Company Equityholders pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Any portion of the
Equityholder Representative Reserve remaining following the determination of
all such fees, costs, expenses, Liabilities and amounts by the Equityholder
Representative in its sole discretion (such portion, the " _Remaining Reserve
Amount_ ") shall be distributed by the Equityholder Representative to the
Payment Administrator, for further payment to the Company Shareholders each
Company Shareholders Pro Rata Share of the Remaining Reserve Amount.

 



79

    

12.18 _Conflicts; Privileges_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Company has retained
Blank Rome to act as its counsel in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that Blank Rome has not acted as counsel for any other Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that no
other Party to this Agreement has the status of a client of Blank Rome for
conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof.

 

(b) Holdings and Parent each hereby agrees that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Effective Time between Holdings, Parent or any of
their Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) and any Company Equityholder or any of its Affiliates (including,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company), Blank Rome may represent
the Company Equityholder or any such Affiliate in such dispute, even though
the interests of the Company Equityholder or such Affiliate may be directly
adverse to Holdings, Parent or any of their Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), and even though Blank Rome may
have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such
dispute.

 

(c) Holdings and Parent each (i) hereby waives, on behalf of itself and
each of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) any claim that it has or may have that Blank Rome has a conflict
in interest in connection with or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in
such representations described in  _Section_ __ _ 12.18(b)_; and (ii) agrees
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Effective Time between
Holdings, Parent or any of their Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) and any Company Equityholder or any of its Affiliates, Blank
Rome may represent Company Equityholder or any such Affiliate in such dispute,
even though the interest of Company Equityholder or any such Affiliate may be
directly adverse to Holdings, Parent or any of their Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation), and even though Blank Rome may have represented
the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 

(d) Each of Holdings and Parent, on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation)

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") is entered into and
effective this the [●] day of [●], 2020, by and among Acquiom Clearinghouse
LLC (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), Vision Investment, LLC (" _Purchaser_ ") and
Michael Scobey, solely in his capacity as the Equityholder Representative (the
" _Equityholder Representative_ " and together with the Purchaser, the "
_Parties_ ") on behalf of the Company Equityholders (as defined in the Merger
Agreement). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Escrow
Agreement have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as
defined below).

 

WHEREAS, Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative have entered into that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 25, 2020, (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), with EnPro Industries, Inc., a North Carolina
corporation, Vision Investment Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
Alluxa, Inc., a California corporation, and the Key Shareholders;

WHEREAS, Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative desire for the Escrow
Agent to open an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") into which Purchaser will
deposit (or cause to be deposited), funds to be held, disbursed, and invested
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Escrow Agreement, and Escrow Agent
is willing to act as the escrow agent with respect to the Escrow Account,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof;

WHEREAS, EnPro Holdings, Inc., a North Carolina corporation and the indirect
parent entity of Purchaser, has entered into that certain Master Payments
Administration Agreement , dated as of [●], 2020 (the " _Payments Agreement_
"), with Acquiom Financial LLC (" _Payments Administrator_ "), pursuant to
which the Payments Administrator has established an account for the purpose of
receiving certain funds disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Escrow
Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, _Schedule I_ to this Escrow Agreement sets forth the wire transfer
instructions for the Purchaser, the Payments Administrator and the Escrow
Agent.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 



   I. |

Terms and Conditions; Disposition of Escrow Funds; Presentation and Payment of
Claims  

---|--- 

1.1. Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative hereby appoint the
Escrow Agent as their escrow agent, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts its
duties as provided herein. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of
this Escrow Agreement, Purchaser will transfer (or cause to be transferred),
funds in the amount of $5,137,500 (the " _Escrow Funds_ ") by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent to be held, disbursed and
invested as provided in this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall maintain
the Escrow Account as a segregated account, and upon receipt of the Escrow
Funds, the Escrow Agent shall designate an amount equal to (a) $2,000,000 to
be maintained in a segregated subaccount (the " _NWC Escrow Fund_ "), and (b)
$3,137,500 to be maintained in a segregated subaccount (the " _Indemnity
Escrow Fund_ "). No Escrow Funds held in one subaccount shall be used for any
other purposes other than as set forth in this Escrow Agreement.

 

1.2. Within two Business Days (except as provided below) of receipt of
written instructions or a Final Judgment, as defined below (" _Joint
Instructions_ "), signed by an authorized representative (" _Authorized
Representative_ ") of each of Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative (a
list of whom are provided in _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_, respectively),
the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Funds (or a portion thereof) as
provided in such Joint Instructions, but only to the extent that funds have
been delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1_.
The Joint

   

 Instructions shall include the amount to be disbursed from the NWC Escrow
Fund or the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as applicable, and shall identify the party
to whom the disbursement shall be made. Disbursements made to Purchaser or
the Payments Administrator (for further payment to the Company Shareholders),
as applicable, pursuant to Joint Instructions shall be made in accordance with
the payment instructions set forth on _Schedule I_  hereto or as otherwise
specified in the Joint Instructions. For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, "
_Business Day_ " shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other
day on which commercial banks are required or permitted to be closed in the
State of California or Illinois (excluding closures of physical commercial
bank offices so long as banking transactions can be completed). " _Final
Judgment_ " shall mean a final, non-appealable judgment, order or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction accompanied by a written certification from
counsel for the instructing Party attesting that such order or decree is final
and not subject to further proceedings or appeal along with a written
instruction from an Authorized Representative of the instructing Party given
to effectuate such order or decree.

 

1.3 In the event that Purchaser or the Equityholder Representative provides
a formal notice to the other regarding a claim against funds in the Escrow
Funds, the party delivering such notice shall simultaneously deliver a copy of
such notice to Escrow Agent; _provided, however_ , that Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to act upon any such notice and shall be considered
informational only with respect to Escrow Agent.



   II. |

Provisions as to the Escrow Agent 

---|--- 
 

2.1. This Escrow Agreement expressly and exclusively sets forth the duties
of the Escrow Agent with respect to any and all matters pertinent hereto and
no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Escrow Agreement
against the Escrow Agent. In performing its duties under this Escrow
Agreement, or upon the claimed failure to perform its duties, the
Escrow Agent shall have no liability hereunder except for the Escrow Agents
fraud, willful misconduct, bad faith, or gross negligence. In no event shall
the Escrow Agent be liable hereunder for incidental, indirect, special,
consequential or punitive damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The
Escrow Agent shall have no liability with respect to the transfer or
distribution of any funds effected by the Escrow Agent pursuant to wiring or
Joint Instructions provided to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Escrow Agreement. Any wire transfers of funds made by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement will be made subject to and in
accordance with the Escrow Agents usual and ordinary wire transfer procedures
in effect from time to time, including without limitation call-back
procedures. The Parties understand that the Escrow Agents inability to
receive or confirm funds transfer instructions pursuant to such security
procedure may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer and agree
that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any such
delay. Except as otherwise provided herein, no provision of this Escrow
Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability or potential financial liability in
the performance of its duties or the exercise of its rights under this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or
to commence any proceedings in connection with this Escrow Agreement or any
property held hereunder or to appear in, prosecute or defend in any such legal
action or proceedings. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to perform any of
its duties hereunder through its affiliates, agents, attorneys, custodians
or nominees. Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.1_, the Escrow Agent shall be responsible for the acts or omissions of its
affiliates, agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees performed in connection
with the Escrow Agents duties hereunder.

 



2

    

2.2. This Escrow Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
Escrow Agent and Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative (but not
between Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative) in connection with the
subject matter of this Escrow Agreement, and no other agreement entered into
between Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative, or either of them,
including, without limitation, the Merger Agreement, shall be considered as
adopted or binding, in whole or in part, upon the Escrow Agent notwithstanding
that any such other agreement may be deposited with the Escrow Agent or the
Escrow Agent may have knowledge thereof.

2.3. Subject to the terms hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be protected in
acting upon any written instruction, notice, request or instrument which the
Escrow Agent reasonably believes to be genuine and what it purports, to be,
including, but not limited to, items directing investment or non-investment
of funds, items requesting or authorizing release, disbursement or retainage
of the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement and items amending the terms of
this Escrow Agreement, in each case, to the extent the Escrow Agent is
entitled to act upon such item pursuant to the terms of this Escrow Agreement.

 

2.4. The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in the event of any
dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or
its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no liability and shall be fully
protected in acting in good faith in accordance with the advice of such
counsel.

 

2.5. In the event of any disagreement between Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative, or between either of them and any other party,
resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the
matters covered by this Escrow Agreement, or in the event that the Escrow
Agent is reasonably in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder,
the Escrow Agent may, at its option, refuse to comply with such claims or
demands on it, or refuse to take any other action hereunder, so long as such
disagreement continues or such doubt exists, and in any such event, the Escrow
Agent shall not be or become liable in any way or to any party for its
failure or refusal to act, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue
to refrain from acting until (a) the rights of Purchaser and the Equityholder
Representative and all other interested parties shall have been fully and
finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (b) all
differences shall have been adjudged and all doubt resolved by agreement among
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative and all other interested
parties, and the Escrow Agent shall have been notified thereof in writing
signed by Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative. Notwithstanding the
preceding, the Escrow Agent may in its reasonable discretion obey the order,
judgment, decree or levy of any court, whether with or without jurisdiction,
or of an agency of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, or
of any agency of any State of the United States or of any political
subdivision thereof, and the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized in its
reasonable discretion, to comply with and obey any such orders, judgments,
decrees or levies and it shall not be liable to any of the Parties hereto or
to any other person, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance
notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated. The rights of the Escrow Agent under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_ are cumulative of all other rights which it may have by
law or otherwise.

2.6. Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Company Shareholders and in its capacity as the Equityholder Representative,
not in its individual capacity) agree, except as specifically provided in
_Section_ __ _ 4.2_, to severally but not jointly indemnify and hold harmless
the Escrow Agent and each of the Escrow Agents officers, directors, agents
and employees (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against
any and all losses, liabilities, claims made by any Party or any other person
or entity, damages, expenses and costs (including, without limitation,
reasonable documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses) of every
nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Losses_ ") which any such Indemnified
Party may incur and which arise directly or indirectly from this Escrow
Agreement or which arise directly or indirectly by virtue of the Escrow
Agents undertaking to serve as the Escrow Agent hereunder; _provided_ ,
however, that no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnity with respect
to Losses that have been primarily caused by any

 



3

    

 Indemnified Partys fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. Solely as between Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative,
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall each be responsible for
payment of fifty percent (50%) of such Losses. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 2._ _5_ shall survive the termination of this Escrow Agreement
and any resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent with respect to Losses
attributable to the time period prior to such termination, resignation or
removal.

 

2.6. Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or
substantially all the escrow business of the Escrow Agent may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

 

2.7. The Escrow Agent may resign at any time from its obligations under
this Escrow Agreement by providing thirty (30) calendar days prior written
notice to Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative. Similarly, the Escrow
Agent may be removed and replaced following the giving of thirty (30) calendar
days prior written notice to the Escrow Agent by the other Parties hereto.
In either event, such resignation or removal shall be effective on the date
set forth in such written notice, which shall be no earlier than thirty (30)
calendar days after such written notice has been furnished, and Purchaser and
the Equityholder Representative shall promptly appoint a successor escrow
agent. In the event no successor escrow agent has been appointed on or prior
to the date such resignation is to become effective, the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to tender into the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction
all Escrow Funds delivered hereunder and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon be
relieved of all further duties and obligations under this Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent hereunder.



   III. |

Compensation of the Escrow Agent 

---|--- 
 

3.1. Purchaser shall pay the fees, costs, and expenses for the services
provided by the Escrow Agent hereunder in accordance with invoices,
consistent with the fees, costs, and expenses set forth on _Exhibit B_
attached hereto. The Escrow Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, a prior
lien upon the Escrow Funds with respect to its unpaid fees and unsatisfied
indemnification rights, superior to the interests of any other persons or
entities and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees
and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the Escrow Funds that remain
unpaid for a period of thirty (30) days after providing the Purchaser with an
invoice for such amounts.



   IV. |

Miscellaneous 

---|--- 
 

4.1. During the term of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Funds shall be
held at HSBC Bank, USA, N.A., in an account that will not earn interest.
Instructions to deposit in any other manner must be in writing and signed by
each of the Parties. The Parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent
will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either
the investment of moneys held in the Escrow Account or the purchase, sale,
retention or other disposition of any investment. Any interest will accrue on
Escrow Funds deposits beginning the day immediately following the day Escrow
Funds deposits are received, based on the daily average balances of Escrow
Funds so held in the Escrow Account. Any interest will be credited monthly and
become part of the Escrow Funds. Deposits into the Escrow Account are insured,
subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ "), in the standard FDIC insurance amount
of $250,000, including principal and accrued interest, and are not secured.
Escrow Agent or its affiliates may receive compensation from third parties
based on balances deposited in the Escrow Account.

 



4

    

4.2 Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative agree that, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement, the owner of the Escrow
Account is the Purchaser and all interest and income from the investment of
the funds shall be reported by the Escrow Agent to the United States Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") as having been earned by Purchaser as of the end
of the calendar year in which it was earned, whether or not such income was
disbursed during such calendar year. The Escrow Agent shall be deemed a payor
of any interest or other income paid upon investment of the Escrow Account
for purposes of performing tax reporting and shall withhold any taxes as
required by applicable law, and shall properly remit such taxes to the
appropriate authorities. With respect to any other payments made under this
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be deemed a payor and shall have
no responsibility for performing tax reporting. The Escrow Agents function of
making such other payments is solely ministerial and upon express direction
of the Parties. On or before the execution and delivery of this Escrow
Agreement, each of Purchaser and Equityholder Representative shall provide to
the Escrow Agent a correct, duly completed, dated and executed current
IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8, whichever is appropriate (or any successor forms
thereto), in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Escrow Agent,
including appropriate supporting documentation and/or any other form,
document, and/or certificate required or reasonably requested by the Escrow
Agent to validate the form provided. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein provided, except for the delivery and filing of tax information
reporting forms required pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, to be delivered and filed with the IRS by the Escrow Agent, as escrow
agent hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall have no duty to prepare or file any
federal or state tax report or return with respect to any funds held pursuant
to this Escrow Agreement or any income earned thereon. Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Shareholders and in
its capacity as the Equityholder Representative, not in its individual
capacity), jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax, late payment, interest,
penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed against the Escrow
Agent on or with respect to the funds deposited under this Escrow Agreement or
any earnings or interest thereon unless such tax, late payment, interest,
penalty or other cost or expense was finally adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have been directly caused by the fraud, gross
negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. The
indemnification provided in this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ is in addition to
the indemnification provided to the Escrow Agent elsewhere in this Escrow
Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and
the termination of this Escrow Agreement with respect to Losses attributable
to the period prior to such resignation, removal or termination.

4.3 The Escrow Agent shall provide monthly reports of transactions
and balances to Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative as of the end
of each month, until the final disbursement of all Escrow Funds. Except as
otherwise provided herein, this Escrow Agreement shall terminate upon the
final disbursement of all Escrow Funds and property held by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement.

4.4. Any notice, request for consent, report, or any other communication
required or permitted in this Escrow Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed to have been given when delivered (i) personally, (ii) by electronic
mail to the e-mail address given below, and written confirmation of receipt is
obtained promptly after completion of the transmission, (iii) by overnight
delivery with a reputable national overnight delivery service, or (iv) by

4.5. This Escrow Agreement is intended to be construed according to the
laws of the State of Delaware. Except as permitted in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
neither this Escrow Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by any party hereto without the express written consent of each of

4.6. The terms of this Escrow Agreement may be altered, amended, modified
or revoked only by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties hereto.

4.7. If any provision of this Escrow Agreement shall be held or deemed to
be or shall in fact, be illegal, inoperative or unenforceable, the same shall
not affect any other provision or provisions herein contained or render the
same invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.

4.8. This Escrow Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Indemnified
Parties, Purchaser, the Equityholder Representative and the Escrow Agent, and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person or entity any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Escrow Agreement.

4.9. No party to this Escrow Agreement shall be liable to any other party
hereto for Losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under
the terms of this Escrow Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war,
terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission
failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control.

4.10. All titles and headings in this Escrow Agreement are intended solely
for convenience of reference and shall in no way limit or otherwise affect the
interpretation of any of the provisions hereof.

 

4.11. This Escrow Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

4.12. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Escrow Agreement and, if necessary, from time to time thereafter, each of the
Parties shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Certificate of
Incumbency substantially in the form of _Exhibit A-1_ and  _Exhibit A-2_
hereto (a " _Certificate of Incumbency_ ") for the purpose of establishing the
identity and authority of persons entitled to issue notices, instructions or
directions to the Escrow Agent on behalf of each such Party. Until such time
as the Escrow Agent shall receive an amended Certificate of Incumbency
replacing any Certificate of Incumbency theretofore delivered to the Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in relying, without further
inquiry, on the most recent Certificate of Incumbency furnished to the Escrow
Agent. Whenever this Escrow Agreement provides for Joint Instructions, joint
written instructions or other joint actions to be delivered to the Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in relying, without further
inquiry, on any Joint Instruction, joint written notice, joint written
instructions or action executed by persons named in such Certificate
of Incumbency.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT:

 

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When
a party opens an account, the Escrow Agent will ask for each partys name,
address, date of birth, or other appropriate information that will allow
the Escrow Agent to identify such party. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see
each partys drivers license or other identifying documents.

(b) _Sharing Percentage_. A Member owning Common Units shall have that "

shall determine to be in the best interests of the Company, and any such
additional issuance may result in a dilution of the Sharing Percentage (or
other measure of participation) of any previously issued Membership Interests
(or Membership Interests for which any previously issued options may be
exercised). The Company shall admit the recipient(s) of any such Membership

limiting the foregoing, upon an issuance by the Company of any options or

Company may, with the consent of the Board of Directors, offer the Members the

3.5 _Preemptive Rights_.

 

(a) Each Member shall have a preemptive right to purchase New Membership
Interests in connection with a capital call pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.4(b)_ or otherwise which the Company may, from time to time, propose to sell
or issue, in the respective amounts as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.5(c)_;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the preemptive right of any Member to purchase
New Membership Interests pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ shall not apply
to any (i) issuances of New Membership Interests pursuant to bank,
other institutional or lease financing, or other credit arrangements of the
Company, including in connection with debt financings, refinancings,
restructurings or similar transactions, (ii) issuances of New Membership
Interests as consideration in connection with any acquisition by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, consideration in
the form of "roll-over" equity or initial grants of New Membership Interests
to management or employees of an acquired or merged Person), (iii) issuances
of New Membership Interests to employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (A) as compensation, or (B) in exchange for consideration, and
(iv) New Membership Interests issued in connection with any Unit split, Unit
dividend, recapitalization or similar transactions involving the Company.

 

(b) In the event the Company proposes to undertake a sale or issuance of
New Membership Interests as provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ ("
_Company Issuance_ "), it shall give written notice (the " _Preemptive Right
Notice_ ") of its intention to do so to each Member. The Preemptive Rights
Notice shall describe (i) the type of New Membership Interests to be sold or
issued, (ii) the amount of New Membership Interests to be sold or issued (the
" _Issuance Amount_ "), (iii) the price for each such New Membership Interest,
and (iv) any other material terms of the Company Issuance.

(c) Each Member shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase
up to its Sharing Percentage of the Issuance Amount (each such right, a "
_Preemptive Right_ "), at the purchase price and on the other terms set forth
in the Preemptive Rights Notice. Each Member may exercise its Preemptive
Right by providing written notice thereof (an " _Exercise Notice_ ") to the
Company within 10 Business Days after its receipt of the Preemptive Rights
Notice (the " _Preemptive Rights Period_ "). Any Member who does not deliver
an Exercise Notice within the Preemptive Rights Period shall be deemed to have
waived its Preemptive Right with respect to such New Membership Interests.

 



11

    

(d) If any Member fails or declines to exercise its Preemptive Rights in
accordance with subsection _(c)_ above in full, the Company shall promptly
give notice (the " _Second Exercise Notice_ ") to the Members who exercised in
full their Preemptive Rights (the " _Oversubscription Participants_ ") in
accordance with subsection _(b)_ above. Each Oversubscription Participant
shall have 5 Business Days from the date of the Second Participation Notice
(the " _Second Participation Period_ ") to notify the Company of its desire
to purchase more than its Sharing Percentage of the Issuance Amount, stating
the number of the additional Issuance Amount it proposes to purchase (the "
_Additional Number_ "). If, as a result thereof, such oversubscription
exceeds the total amount of the remaining Issuance Amount available for
purchase, each Oversubscription Participant will be cut back by the Company
with respect to its oversubscription such that each Oversubscription
Participant may purchase a portion of such remaining New Securities equal to
the portion of the New Securities it could subscribe for in accordance with
subsection _(c)_ above.

 

(e) In the event that any Member elects to exercise its Preemptive Right,
such Member(s) shall pay the Company the purchase price for such New
Membership Interests on or before the earlier of (i) 15 days after expiration
of the Preemptive Rights Period, and (ii) such other date as is expressly set
forth in the Preemptive Rights Notice.

 

(f) In the event that the Members do not elect to purchase (in the
aggregate) the entire amount of the Issuance Amount pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_, the Company may sell or issue such remaining amount of
the Issuance Amount pursuant to the Company Issuance, for a purchase price not
less, and upon the terms and conditions no more favorable, than as set forth
in the Preemptive Rights Notice. If the Company Issuance is not consummated
within 120 days after the expiration of the Preemptive Rights Period, then the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ must be satisfied  _de nov_ o before
the Company can undertake a sale or issuance of New Membership Interests.

(g) No Preemptive Right may be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole
or in part by any Member except in connection with a Transfer of such Members
Membership Interests permitted under _Article 7_.

 

3.6 _Member Capital_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement: (a)
no Member shall demand or be entitled to receive a return of or interest on
its Capital Contributions, and (b) no Member shall withdraw any portion of its
Capital Contributions or be entitled to receive any distributions from the
Company as a return of capital on account of such Capital Contributions.

3.7 _Member Loans; Cash Management_. No Member shall be required to make
any loans or otherwise lend any funds to the Company. The parties acknowledge
that the Company and its Subsidiaries may freely engage in activities related
to cash management, cash pooling and intercompany lending (including
maintaining the accounting for the assets and liabilities for the respective
entities) as directed by Holdings, Parent and their Affiliates. Holdings,
Parent or their Affiliates shall be permitted (but not required) to make loans
to, act as surety or endorser for, assume one or more specific obligations
of, provide collateral for, or enter into other similar credit, guarantee,
financing or refinancing arrangements with, the Company for any purpose, and
the

 



12

    

 Company and its Subsidiaries may be required to act as guarantors, co-
borrowers, grantors or pledgors of security interests in their assets, or in
any other capacity as credit parties with respect to the financing facilities
of Parent and its Affiliates; provided that the foregoing shall be subject to
Section 5.3(d) for Related Party Transactions to the extent that such section
is applicable. No loans made by any Member to the Company shall have any
effect on such Members Sharing Percentage, such loans representing a debt of
the Company payable or collectible solely from the assets of the Company in
accordance with the terms and conditions upon which such loans were made.

3.8 _Loans by Third Parties_. Without limiting _Article 5_ , the Company,
and the Board of Directors on behalf of the Company, may borrow funds or enter
into other similar credit, guarantee, financing or refinancing arrangements
for any purpose.

 

3.9 _Limited Liability of the Members_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary and except as otherwise required by Law, no Member shall have
any liability for any losses of the Company (beyond the potential loss of its
share of undistributed assets of the Company, including the amount of its
unreturned capital contributions).

 

ARTICLE 4

 

 _DISTRIBUTIONS_

 

4.1 _Distributions_.

 

(a) The Board of Directors shall determine, in its sole and absolute
discretion, (i) to what extent the Company has Available Cash available for
distribution, and (ii) to the extent Available Cash is available, whether it
is in the best interests of the Company and its Members to distribute any such
Available Cash to the Members; provided, that in the event the Board of
Directors decides to make any such distributions to the Members, such
distributions shall be made to the Members _pro rata_ in accordance with their
respective Sharing Percentage.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_, the Company shall make
payments to Holdings (or Parent) in an amount reasonably determined by Parent
to reflect the Companys share of the groups consolidated or combined
federal, state, and local income tax liability. Any payments made pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_ shall not be treated as an advance on
distributions to which Holdings is otherwise entitled under this Agreement.

 

4.2 _Distributions In Kind_. In the event that the Company distributes
property in kind, such property shall be reasonably valued by the Board of
Directors. Valuations so determined will be binding on the Members for all
purposes. The property shall be deemed to be an amount of cash equal to the
determined value of such property and distributed in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.1_.

4.3 _Limitations on Distributions_. The Company shall make
no distributions to the Members except as provided in this _Article 4_ or in
_Article 9_. A Member may not receive a distribution from the Company to the
extent that, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the
Company, other than liability to Members on account of their Capital
Contributions, would exceed the fair value of the Company Assets.

 



13

    

4.4 _Return of Distributions_. Members and Assignees who
receive distributions by the Company made in violation of the Act or this
Agreement (or due to overpayment for any reason, such as accounting error)
shall promptly return such distributions to the Company. The amount of any
distribution returned to the Company by a Member or Assignee shall be added
to the account or accounts from which it was subtracted when it was
distributed to such Member or Assignee.

 

4.5 _Indemnification_ _and Reimbursement for Payments on Behalf of a
Member_. Except as otherwise provided herein, if the Company is required by
law to make any payment to a governmental body that is specifically
attributable to a Member or a Members status as such (including federal
withholding taxes, state personal property taxes, state unincorporated
business taxes), then such Member shall indemnify and contribute to the
Company in full for the entire amount paid (including interest, penalties and
related expenses). The Board of Directors may offset distributions to which a
Member is otherwise entitled under this Agreement against such Members
obligation to indemnify the Company under this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_. A
Members obligation to indemnify and make contributions to the Company under
this  _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ shall survive the transfer, forfeiture or other
disposition of such indemnifying Members ownership interest in the Company
and the termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company,
and for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_, the Company shall be treated
as continuing in existence. The Company may pursue and enforce all rights and
remedies it may have against each Member under this  _Section_ __ _ 4.5_,
including instituting a lawsuit to collect such indemnification and
contribution with interest calculated at a rate per annum equal to the Prime
Rate plus three percentage points (but not in excess of the highest rate per
annum permitted by law).

appoint the Director whose death, resignation, removal or other departure
resulted in such vacancy shall have the right to appoint another individual to
serve in place of such Director.

any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or passing any
written consent or resolution of the Board of Directors, provided that at any
time that less than 80% of the Directors are appointed by Holdings, then the
Directors appointed by Holdings shall at all times have the right to cast at
least 80% of votes on all matters submitted to the Board of Directors. If more
than one Director appointed by Holdings is participating in voting on any
matter submitted to the Board of Directors, then the foregoing voting
percentage shall be allocated in equal amounts to each such participating
Director. At all meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof,
the Directors holding a majority of the votes entitled to be voted
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act by a
majority vote of the votes entitled to be voted by the Directors or committee
members present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of
the Board of Directors.

Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors by means of a
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which
all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such
participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting.

 



15

    

(f) _Action of the Board of Directors by Written Consent_. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the
minimum number of members of the Board of Directors that would be necessary
to authorize or take such action at a meeting, and such writing or writings

Subsidiarys board of managers or board of directors, be prohibited from
pursuing and engaging in any such activities, (E) no Member or its Affiliates
will be obligated to inform the Board of Directors, the Company or any of its

extent that they restrict, eliminate or otherwise modify duties or
liabilities (including fiduciary duties) of the aforesaid Persons existing at

performed by such Director in connection with the Business and affairs of the

corporation formed under the laws of Delaware and such Director were a
director of such corporation.

(ii) The Company, its receiver, or its trustee (in the case of its
receiver or trustee, to the extent of the Companys property) shall indemnify,
hold harmless and pay

 



20

    

 all judgments and claims against any Member and its Affiliates relating to
any liability or damage incurred from third party claims by reason of being a
Member, or an Affiliate of a Member, except to the extent such Member is
liable for indemnity under _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_, __ and shall advance
reasonable expenses in connection therewith.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no indemnity under 
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_ shall extend to any claim
related to, or any losses or damages resulting from (A) a claim, action or
demand between or among the Members or (B) a Directors, Persons or Members

indemnity is claimed, together with photocopies of any and all letters,
pleadings or other documents in the Indemnitees possession which are alleged
to form the material basis of any such claim or action; provided, that the
failure to provide such notice in a timely fashion shall not affect the
Indemnitors obligations hereunder except to the extent that any delay in
providing such notice results in actual prejudice to the Indemnitor. In any
case, the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in the defense of any
such claim or action to the extent that the Indemnitor and Indemnitee are not
adverse parties or have adverse interests therein. The Indemnitor shall have
the right to control the defense of any such claim or action by counsel of the
Indemnitors choice, at the Indemnitors sole cost and expense. The
Indemnitee shall have the right to observe any legal proceedings relating to
any such claim or action and to retain its own counsel, it being understood
that the fees and expenses of the Indemnitees counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnitee (unless (i) the defendants in any such claim or action include both
the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee shall have been advised
by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such
Indemnitee that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnitor or (ii) the Indemnitor fails promptly to assume the defense and
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, in which cases such
reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid by the Indemnitor). The Indemnitor

direction (however embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ __ shall not be deemed

_however_ , that any Transfer by Holdings that is not to an Affiliate of
Holdings, to any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or pursuant to an initial public offering of the Business (a "
_Triggering Sale_ ") shall be subject to the restrictions described in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_. In addition to the foregoing, any merger,
consolidation, tender offer or other business combination or similar
transaction which results in Holdings or an Affiliate of Holdings owning a
smaller percentage of the outstanding Membership Interests of the Company that
Holdings held immediately prior to such transaction shall also be deemed to
be a " _Triggering Sale_ " and shall therefore be subject to the restrictions
described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

Sale, Holdings shall deliver a tag-along notice (the " _Tag-Along Notice_")

purchaser (the " _Tag-Along Purchaser_") or that are otherwise subject to the
Triggering Sale (the " _Offered Interests_ "), the price and the terms of
payment therefor, and any other material terms of such proposed Triggering
Sale. The Rollover Equityholders shall have the right to elect to participate
in the proposed Triggering Sale, upon the terms and conditions set forth in
the Tag-Along Notice, by delivering written notice of such election to
Holdings within ten (10) Business Days after the Tag-Along Notice is delivered
to such Rollover Equityholder (such period, the " _Tag-Along Option
Period_"). Each Rollover Equityholder shall be entitled, but is not required,
to sell to the Tag-Along Purchaser, on substantially the same terms and
conditions as Holdings, up to such Rollover Equityholders Sharing Percentage
of the aggregate amount of the Offered Interests. Each Rollover Equityholder
that exercises its right to sell any portion of its Membership Interests
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ agrees to timely take all such other
actions as Holdings reasonably requests in connection with such proposed
Triggering Sale, and to make representations and warranties and agree to
covenants and indemnities that are substantially similar to those made by
Holdings in connection with such Triggering Sale; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, other than as set forth in any agreement that the
Rollover Equityholders may agree to enter into prior to the closing of the
Proposed Sale, the Rollover Equityholders shall not be required to covenant to
restrict its ability to compete or engage in any line or type of business or
in any geographic area. 

(b) Failure by a Rollover Equityholder to deliver to Holdings a notice of
its intent to participate in the proposed Triggering Sale prior to the
expiration of the Tag-Along Option Period shall be deemed an election of such
Rollover Equityholder not to participate in the proposed Transfer.

 

(c) To the extent any Rollover Equityholder validly exercised its tag-
along right pursuant to, and otherwise complied with, _Section_ __ _
7.3(a)_, Holdings shall not Transfer any Offered Interests to the Tag-Along
Purchaser or otherwise effectuate the Triggering Sale unless and until,
simultaneously with such Triggering Sale, the Tag-Along Purchaser purchases
such Rollover Equityholders Membership Interests it elected to include in the
contemplated Triggering Sale in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_.

7.4 _Further Restrictions_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, unless expressly waived in writing by the Company (if such wavier is
permitted by applicable Law), which waiver may be given or withheld in the
Board of Directors absolute discretion, any otherwise permitted Transfer

(a) such Transfer requires the registration of such Transferred
Membership Interests pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities
Laws;

(b) such Transfer subjects the Company to regulation under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, or Title I of the

loss and similar items and to distributions as was held by such Incapacitated

50 miles from such employees current office, other than a temporary
relocation (including any relocation caused by a force majeure event) or a
relocation approved by the Rollover Director; provided the Company does not
cure such situation within 30 days following the employees written notice to
the Company of the event constituting Good Reason (which notice of Good Reason
must be provided to the Company within 60 days after the date on which the
event constituting Good Reason first becomes known to the Employee).

(i) " _Measurement Date_ " means, with respect to each installment of
any Employee Termination Sale, December 31 of the applicable calendar year
for which Adjusted EBITDA is determined.

 

(j) " _Per-Unit Portion_" means a ratio, the numerator of which one (1)
Common Unit, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Common
Units issued and outstanding as of the applicable Trigger Date.

 

(k) " _Trigger Date_ " means, with respect to the applicable Rollover
Equityholder, the earliest to occur of the Put/Call Notice Date, the Employee
Termination Notice Date, or the Company Termination Notice Date.

 

8.6 _Dispute Resolution_. If the Rollover Equityholder notifies Holdings
and the Company of its disagreement with the amount paid in connection with
any installment due under this _Article 8_ within 30 days following the date
of such payment, and if such Rollover Equityholder and Holdings are unable to
resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of such notice of disagreement, then either the Rollover
Equityholder or Holdings may require that the Rollover Equityholder and
Holdings mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same shall be
finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by an
independent nationally or regionally recognized accounting firm mutually
agreed to by the Rollover Equityholder and Holdings (the accounting firm
ultimately chosen, the " _Accounting Referee_ "). The Rollover Equityholder,
the Company and Holdings will cooperate with the Accounting Referee in good
faith and in all reasonable respects as may be requested by the Accounting
Referee, including providing the Accounting Referee reasonable access during
normal business hours and on reasonable advance notice to any relevant
personnel, properties, and books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, subject to confidentiality obligations. The Rollover
Equityholder and Holdings will cause the Accounting Referee to limit its
review and

 



36

    

 determination to those items set forth on the Rollover Equityholders notice
of disagreement that remain in dispute and that relate to accounting matters,
and to deliver a written report containing its calculations of each such
disputed item. The final determination of the Accounting Referee will be made
in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the
definitions of Exit Price). The Accounting Referee will determine the items
in dispute solely based on written submissions made by the Rollover
Equityholder and Holdings (and their respective representatives) consistent
with the terms hereof (and not by independent review). The Accounting Referee
shall determine and report in writing to the Rollover Equityholder and
Holdings as to the resolution of all disputed matters and the effect of such
determinations on the Preliminary Exit Price Statement within thirty (30) days
after such submission or such longer period as the Accounting Referee may
reasonably require, and such determinations shall be final, binding and
conclusive on all parties hereto, absent manifest error, and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. None of the
Rollover Equityholder, Holdings, the Company or their respective
representatives will have any ex parte communications or meetings with the
Accounting Referee concerning the subject matter hereof without the prior
written consent of the other party. The Accounting Referee will not assign a
value to any disputed item that is greater than the greater value for such
disputed item claimed by either party in its written submission or less than
the lesser value for such item claimed by either party in its written
submission. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Referee shall be
borne by the parties (i.e., the Rollover Equityholder, on the one hand, or
Holdings, on the other hand) proportionately, based on the amount assigned by
each party to items in dispute, on a net basis, relative to the amount finally
determined by the Accounting Referee (or equally in the event the parties
assigned amounts were, on a net basis, equally far from the amount finally
determined by the Accounting Referee).

ARTICLE 9

 

 _DISSOLUTION, LIMITATION, AND TERMINATION OF THE COMPANY_

 

9.1 _Limitations_. The Company may be dissolved, liquidated, and
terminated and have its affairs wound up only pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article 9_ , and the Members hereto do hereby irrevocably waive any and
all other rights they may have to cause a dissolution of the Company or a sale
or partition of any or all of the Company Assets.

 

9.2 _Exclusive Causes_. The following and only the following events shall
cause the Company to be dissolved, liquidated, and terminated:

(a) subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, an election by a
Majority in Interest to dissolve the Company;

(b) subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, a determination by
the Board of Directors to dissolve the Company;

 

(c) the Incapacity of the sole remaining Member; or

 

(d) a judicial determination that an event has occurred that makes it
unlawful, impossible or impractical to carry on the Business and affairs of
the Company.

 



37

    

Any dissolution of the Company other than as provided in this _Section_ __ _
9.2_ shall be a dissolution in contravention of this Agreement.

9.3 _Effect of Dissolution_. The dissolution of the Company shall be
effective on the date on which the event occurs giving rise to the
dissolution, but the Company shall not terminate until it has been wound up,
the Company Assets have been liquidated and/or distributed as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_, and its certificate of dissolution and/or certificate of
cancellation, as applicable, has been filed with the Secretary of State.
Notwithstanding the dissolution of the Company, prior to the termination of
the Company, the Business and the affairs of the Company and the Members, as
such, shall continue to be governed by this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Article 9_ is intended to limit the survival of provisions of this Agreement
that expressly survive the dissolution and termination of the Company.

9.4 _Liquidation and Final Distribution Proceeds_.

 

(a) Upon the dissolution of the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_,
the Company shall thereafter engage in no further business other than that
which is necessary to wind up the Business and affairs of the Company, and the
Board of Directors, after the establishment of appropriate reserves, shall
liquidate all Company Assets and distribute the cash proceeds therefrom. The
cash proceeds from the liquidation of Company Assets shall be applied or
distributed by the Company in the following order:

 

(i) First, to the payment and discharge of all of the Companys debts and
other liabilities to creditors (including Members that are creditors); and

(ii) The balance, if any, to the Members in accordance with _Section_ __ _
4.1_.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board of
Directors determines that an immediate sale of all or any portion of the
Company Assets would cause undue loss to the Members, the Board of Directors,
in order to avoid such loss to the extent not then prohibited by the Act, may
either defer liquidation of and withhold from distribution for a reasonable
time any Company Assets except those necessary to satisfy the Companys debts
and obligations, or distribute such Company Assets to the Members in kind; 
_provided_ , that with respect to distributions in kind of Company Assets, the
Board of Directors shall give advance written notice of any such in-kind
distribution and, if, after receiving such notice a Member shall determine
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such distribution in kind would
cause such Member to be in violation of any Law, regulation or order, such
Member shall give written notice thereof to the Board of Directors within
five (5) Business Days following its receipt of the notice of distribution,
and the Member and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to
make alternative arrangements.

 

(b) The Board of Directors, in its reasonable discretion, shall determine
whether any Member or Director shall receive additional compensation for any
services performed pursuant to this _Article 9_.

ARTICLE 10

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

 

10.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Members_. Each Member hereby
makes the following representations and warranties to the Company and each
other Member:

(a) If such Member is not a natural person, such Member has been duly
formed or organized and is validly existing in good standing, with all
requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized by
all necessary action on behalf of such Member, and this Agreement constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of such Member, and is enforceable against such
Member in accordance with its terms.

 

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in any
violation of or default under any provision of any charter, bylaws, trust
agreement, operating agreement or other governing instrument applicable to
such Member or under any material agreement or other instrument to which such
Member is a party or by which such Member, or any of its property is bound, or
any permit, franchise, judgment, decree, or Law applicable to such Member or
its business or property.

 

10.2 _Additional Representations and Warranties of Certain Members_. In
addition to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
10.1_, each Member acquiring Membership Interests on the date hereof hereby
makes the following representations and warranties to the Company and
Holdings:

 

(a) Such Rollover Equityholder is acquiring its Membership Interests solely
for investment, for its account and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, the distribution or other disposition thereof.

(b) Such Member understands that the purchase of Membership Interests is a
speculative investment which involves a high degree of risk of loss of its
entire investment therein, there are substantial restrictions on the
transferability of the Membership Interests under the provisions of this
Agreement and the Securities Act, and there will never be a public market for
the Membership Interests and, accordingly, it may not be possible to liquidate
its investment in the Company prior to the dissolution and liquidation of the
Company. Such Member acknowledges that the Membership Interests have not been
registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable blue sky Laws in
reliance in part on such Members representations, warranties and agreements
herein.

(c) Such Members financial situation is such that it can afford to bear
the economic risk of holding the Membership Interests for an indefinite
period of time and can afford to suffer a complete loss of its investment in
the Company.

 

(d) Such Members knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters are such that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
acquisition of its Membership Interests.

 



39

    

(e) No representations or warranties have been made to such Member or its
representatives concerning the Membership Interests or the Company, their
prospects or other matters except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. In
acquiring its Membership Interests, such Member is relying in any way upon any
business plans, projections, representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or promises made by or on behalf of the Company.

 

(f) Such Member is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

(g) Such Member has been advised to discuss this Agreement with its own
attorney, and has carefully read and fully understands all of the provisions
of this Agreement.

(h) Without limiting the representations and warranties set forth above,
such Member will not make any disposition of all or part of its Membership
Interests which will result in the violation by it or the Company of the
Securities Act or any other applicable securities Laws.

10.3 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company hereby
makes the following representations and warranties to each Member acquiring
Membership Interests on the date hereof:

(a) The Company has been duly formed and is validly existing in good
standing, with all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized by
all necessary action on behalf of the Company, and this Agreement constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of the Company, and is enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms.

 

(c) The Membership Interests issued to such Member pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.2_ __ have been duly authorized and validly issued, free and clear of
any liens, except for restrictions provided for herein or under the Securities
Act and other applicable securities Laws.

 

The representations and warranties set forth in this _Article 10_ shall
survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. The Company, on the
one hand, and the Members, on the other hand, agree to indemnify, defend,
protect, and hold harmless the other parties against any and all loss,
liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, without
limitation, any and all expenses whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation commenced or
threatened or any claim whatsoever) arising out of or based upon any false
representation or warranty made by the Company or Members, as applicable,
herein.

ARTICLE 11

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

11.1 _Spousal Consent_. If a Member who is a natural Person is married,
then such Member shall obtain from his or her spouse an executed spousal

binding effect of all provisions and restrictions contained in this
Agreement.

Agreement, such Member shall within thirty (30) days thereafter obtain a
Consent of Spouse from his or her new spouse.

 

11.2 _Amendments_. Amendments to this Agreement and to the Certificate of
Formation shall be effective only if approved in writing by a Majority in

agree on behalf of itself, its successors, and its assigns, without further
consideration, to prepare, execute, acknowledge, file, record, publish, and

11.8 _Confidentiality_. Without limiting the provisions of  _Section_ __
_ 6.5_, each Member agrees that the provisions of this Agreement, all
understandings, agreements and other arrangements between and among the

waiver is in writing and is signed by the party against whom the waiver is to
be effective.

 

11.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision and such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
will be reformed, construed and enforced as if such provision had never been
contained herein and there had been contained in this Agreement instead such
valid, legal and enforceable provisions as would most nearly accomplish the
intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

11.12 _Certain Rules of Construction; Interpretation_. Unless the context
requires otherwise:

other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time. This
Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule
requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an

11.13 _Applicable Law; Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware (including in respect of the statute of
limitations or other limitations period applicable to any state Law claim,
controversy or dispute) that apply to agreements made and performed entirely
within the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of
law provisions thereof or of any other jurisdiction. Each party agrees and
acknowledges that the application of the Laws of the State of Delaware is
reasonable and appropriate based upon the parties respective interests and
contacts with the State of Delaware. Each of the parties waives any right or
interest in having the Laws of any other state, including specifically, state
law regarding the statute of limitation or other limitations period, apply to
any partys state Law claim, controversy or dispute which in any way arises
out of or relates to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Subject to the alternative dispute mechanisms expressly set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.6_, each party irrevocably agrees that any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware (and each such party shall not bring any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in
any court other than the aforesaid court), and each party hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of

 



44

    

 motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Action: (i) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
court for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process; (ii)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of such court or
from any legal process commenced in such court (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise); and (iii) that (A) such Action
in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum; (B) the venue of such
Action is improper; and (C) this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by
such court.

 

(c) In the event any Action is commenced by any Person (the " _Claiming
Party_ ") to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other Person
(the " _Defending Party_ "), if the Defending Party is the prevailing party in
such Action, all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and court costs, incurred by the Defending Party in such Action will be
reimbursed by the Claiming Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Defending Party prevails in part, and loses in part, in such Action, the
court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such Action will award
a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Defending
Party on an equitable basis; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Defending Party
is deemed to have prevailed by virtue of claims being voluntarily reduced,
the equitable adjustment shall take into account the proportion of the amount
of Losses actually paid relative to the amount of Losses alleged or sought.
For purposes hereof, and without limitation, the Defending Party will
be deemed to have prevailed in any Action described in the immediately
preceding sentence if the Claiming Party commences any such Action and: (i)
such underlying claim(s) are subsequently dropped or voluntarily dismissed or
voluntarily reduced; and/or (ii) the Defending Party defeats any such
claim(s).

11.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the parties thereto in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each Member shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
by the other and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to thereafter cause the transactions contemplated hereby to
be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth
in this Agreement. The foregoing rights are in addition to and without
limitation of any other remedy to which the parties may be entitled at law or
in equity. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. Each of the parties hereto waives (a) any defenses in any
action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.
