the Accounting Firm is appointed, Parent shall forward a copy of the Closing Date Statement to the Accounting Firm, and the Equityholder Representative shall forward a copy of the Dispute Notice to the Accounting Firm, together with, in each case,
all relevant supporting documentation. The Accounting Firm&#146;s role shall be limited to resolving such objections and determining the correct calculations to be used on only the disputed portions of the Closing Date Statement (including any
dispute with respect to the timeliness of delivery or receipt of any Dispute Notice), and the Accounting Firm shall not make any other determination, including any determination as to whether any other items on the Closing Date Statement are
correct. The Accounting Firm shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by the Equityholder Representative or Parent or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by the Equityholder
Representative or Parent and shall be limited to the selection of either the Equityholder Representative&#146;s or Parent&#146;s position on a disputed item (or a position in between the positions of the Equityholder Representative and Parent) based
solely on presentations and supporting material provided by Parent and Equityholder Representative and not pursuant to any independent review. In resolving such objections, the Accounting Firm shall apply the provisions of this Agreement concerning
determination of the amounts set forth in the Closing Date Statement, including the definition of the Merger Consideration contained herein (and the definitions of the defined terms contained therein). The Accounting Firm shall deliver to the
Equityholder Representative and Parent a written determination (such determination to be made in accordance with <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.9(b)</U> and include a work sheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Accounting Firm by the Equityholder Representative and Parent) of the disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt of such disputed items.
The determination by the Accounting Firm of the disputed amounts and the resulting calculation of the Merger Consideration shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for such
determination shall be borne by the Equityholder Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the manner in which such Person prevails on the items resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be computed by the Accounting Firm at the time its determination of the items in dispute is rendered. For example, should
the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Equityholder Representative&#146;s position, 60% of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm would be borne by Parent and 40% would be borne by
the Equityholder Representative. The Merger Consideration, as finally determined pursuant to this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.9</U>, shall be referred to herein as the &#147;<U>Final Merger Consideration</U>&#148;. </P>
