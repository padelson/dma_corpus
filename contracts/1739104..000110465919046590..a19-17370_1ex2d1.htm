each relevant jurisdiction, that the terms of this Agreement shall govern in
all respects the transfer of the Seller Shares, and that the payment of the
Transaction Consideration under this Agreement shall be deemed to include the
payment of any applicable Transaction Consideration under each Local Share

Section 2.9 _Deferred Closing_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect

Liabilities in such Interim Commercialization Country on the Closing Date;
(ii) the Transferred Employees in such Interim Commercialization Country shall
not be deemed Business Employees at the Closing Date; and (iii) neither Party

Commercialization Country and the delivery of the Interparty Lease Agreements
and Local Asset Purchase Agreements with respect to such Interim
Commercialization Country shall be consummated by entering into a Local Asset
Purchase Agreement with respect to such Interim Commercialization Country at
10:00 a.m., Central European Time, on the last day of the interim period as
defined in the Interim Commercialization Agreement with respect to such
Interim Commercialization Country (each such transaction, a " _Deferred
Closing_ " and each such date, a " _Deferred Closing Date_ "), and the
Deferred Closing shall be deemed to be the Closing, and the Deferred Closing
Date the Closing Date, with respect to all such Transferred Assets, Assumed
Liabilities and Transferred Employees for the purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller Parent shall not be bound by the obligations set forth in Section 5.2
with respect to any Interim Commercialization Country following the Closing
Date and neither Seller Parent nor Purchaser shall be deemed to have given any
of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement as of any
Deferred Closing Date.

 



 

(b) In no event shall the payment of the Transaction Consideration be reduced
or deferred in any respect due to any Deferred Closing; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Closing Working Capital Amount (and the estimation thereof to
determine the Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount), the
Estimated Closing Intercompany Trade Accounts, the Closing Intercompany Trade
Accounts, the Estimated Closing Net Pension Liabilities and the Closing Net
Pension Liabilities, in each case relating to the Transferred Assets, Assumed
Liabilities or Transferred Employees in any Interim Commercialization Country,
shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the Estimated Cash
Consideration Amount and the Cash Adjustment Amount.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Within sixty (60) days following any Deferred Closing, Seller Parent shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser a statement setting forth the
Closing Working Capital Amount, the Closing Intercompany Trade Accounts, and
the Closing Net Pension Liabilities, in each case relating to the Transferred
Assets, Assumed Liabilities and Transferred Employees in the applicable
Interim Commercialization Country as of the applicable Deferred Closing Date
(a " _Deferred Closing Date Statement_ "). Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(d),
Section 2.10(e), Section 2.10(f) and Section 2.10(h) shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ following the delivery of any Deferred Closing Date Statement.
Promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the final
determination of the amounts set forth on a Deferred Closing Date Statement
pursuant to the foregoing sentence, (i) if the Deferred Cash Adjustment Amount
is a positive number, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller Parent the applicable
Deferred Cash Adjustment Amount in Dollars by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Seller Parent or (ii) if the
Deferred Cash Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then Seller Parent shall
pay to Purchaser the absolute value of the Deferred Cash Adjustment Amount in
Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Purchaser.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Calculation of Estimated Cash Consideration Amount, the Cash
Consideration Amount and the Cash Adjustment Amount_.

 



 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller Parent shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser a statement in all material
respects in the form attached hereto as Part A of Exhibit 1 setting forth its
good faith estimate of the following items:

 



 

(i) the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Closing
Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ");

 



 

(ii) the Closing Net Financial Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Net
Financial Indebtedness_ ");

 



 

(iii) the Closing Intercompany Trade Accounts (the " _Estimated Closing
Intercompany Trade Accounts_ ");

 



 

(iv) the Closing Net Pension Liabilities (the " _Estimated Closing Net Pension
Liabilities_ ");

 



 

(v) the Closing Net Tax Position (the " _Estimated Closing Net Tax Position_
"); and

 



 

(vi) the Estimated Cash Consideration Amount, derived from the foregoing.

 



 

(b) On or prior to the one hundred twentieth (120th) day following the Closing
Date, Seller Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser a
statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") in all material respects in the
form attached hereto as Part B of Exhibit 1 setting forth the following items:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount;

 



 

(ii) the Closing Net Financial Indebtedness;

 



 

(iii) the Closing Intercompany Trade Accounts;

 



 

(iv) the Closing Net Pension Liabilities;

 



 

(v) the Closing Net Tax Position; and

 



 

(vi) the Cash Consideration Amount, derived from the foregoing.

 



 

(c) In the event that Purchaser determines that the Closing Date Statement is
incorrect or has not been prepared in accordance with Section 2.10(h),
Purchaser shall, on or before the sixtieth (60th) day following the date the
Closing Date Statement is given, so inform Seller Parent in writing (the "
_Purchaser s Objection_"), setting forth a specific description of the items
to which Purchaser objects, the basis of Purchasers Objection and the
adjustments to the Closing Date Statement that Purchaser believes should be
made, together with any evidence or documentation supporting such objection or
adjustments. If Purchasers Objection is not received by Seller Parent on or
before the last day of such sixty (60)-day period or if Purchaser earlier
notifies Seller Parent that it agrees with the Closing Date Statement provided
by Seller Parent, then the Cash Consideration Amount set forth in the Closing
Date Statement delivered by Seller Parent shall be final and binding on the
Parties and their respective Affiliates. Seller Parent shall not be liable
under Section 9.2 for any Losses to the extent reflected in the calculation of
the Cash Consideration Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.10.

 



 

(d) If Seller Parent and Purchaser are unable to resolve all of their
disagreements with respect to the proposed adjustments set forth in
Purchasers Objection within forty-five (45) days following the delivery of
Purchasers Objection, then they shall refer any remaining disagreements to
the CPA Firm which, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall determine,
in accordance with Section 2.10(h), and only with respect to the remaining
disagreements so submitted, whether there were mathematical errors in the
Closing Date Statement or whether items on the Closing Date Statement were
determined or calculated in accordance with Section 2.10(h), to what extent,
if any, the Closing Date Statement and the Cash Consideration Amount require
adjustment. In resolving any disputes pursuant to this Section 2.10(d), the
CPA Firm shall only assign a value to any disputed Closing Date Statement item
that is at or between Seller Parents valuation of such disputed Closing Date
Statement item and the Purchasers valuation of such disputed Closing Date
Statement item. Copies of any written material submitted to the CPA Firm shall
simultaneously be submitted to the other Party. Purchaser and Seller Parent
shall instruct the CPA Firm to deliver its written determination to Purchaser
and Seller Parent no later than thirty (30) days after such remaining
disagreements underlying Purchasers Objection are referred to the CPA Firm.
Subject to Section 319 German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch  BGB_),
the CPA Firms determination shall be

 



     

 

 



 

final and binding upon each Party and its respective Affiliates (as the sole
and exclusive remedy available to the Parties in connection with the
determination of the Closing Date Statement and the calculation of the Cash
Consideration Amount pursuant to this Section 2.10(d)), assuming each of the
Parties is otherwise in compliance with this Section 2.10(d). The fees and
disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller
Parent. Purchaser and Seller Parent shall make readily available to the CPA
Firm all relevant books and records and any work papers (including those of
the Parties respective accountants, to the extent permitted by such
accountants) relating to the Closing Date Statement and Purchasers Objection
and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm in connection
therewith.

 



 

(e) Purchaser shall provide to Seller Parent and its accountants full access
to the Books and Records and to any other information, including work papers
of its accountants (to the extent permitted by such accountants), and to any
employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates during regular Business hours and on
reasonable advance notice, to the extent necessary for Seller Parent to
prepare the Closing Date Statement, to respond to Purchasers Objection and to
prepare materials for presentation to the CPA Firm in connection with Section
2.10(d).

 



 

(f) Seller Parent shall provide to Purchaser and its accountants full access
to any information, including information used by Seller Parent in preparing
the statement referred to in Section 2.10(a) or Closing Date Statement
including work papers of its accountants (to the extent permitted by such
accountants), and to any employees of Seller Parent and its Affiliates during
regular Business hours and on reasonable advance notice, to the extent
necessary for Purchaser to review the statement referred to in Section 2.10(a)
or the Closing Date Statement and to prepare materials for presentation to the
CPA Firm in connection with Section 2.10(d).

 



 

(g) If the amount equal to the Cash Consideration Amount _minus_ the Estimated
Cash Consideration Amount (the " _Cash Adjustment Amount_ ") is a positive
number, then Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) after the final determination thereof in accordance with this
Section 2.10(g) pay to Seller Parent the Cash Adjustment Amount, in Dollars by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Seller Parent. If the Cash Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then Seller
Parent shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after
the final determination thereof in accordance with this Section 2.10(g) pay to
Purchaser the absolute value of the Cash Adjustment Amount, in Dollars by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cash Adjustment Amount shall be reduced by
an amount in Dollars equal to the aggregate cash amounts paid as adjustments
to Local Closing Cash Payments in Local Payment Countries pursuant to the
terms of an applicable Local Agreement, in each case converted into Dollars at
the Reference Exchange Rate as of the date which is one (1) day prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

(h) All determinations under this Agreement (i) with respect to the Estimated
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, shall each be prepared in accordance with the Working

 



      

 

 



 

Capital Provisions and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the Seller
Accounting Guideline; (ii) with respect to Estimated Closing Net Financial
Indebtedness and Closing Net Financial Indebtedness, shall each be prepared in
accordance with the Net Financial Indebtedness Provisions and, to the extent
not inconsistent therewith, the Seller Accounting Guideline; (iii) with
respect to the Estimated Closing Intercompany Trade Accounts and the Closing
Intercompany Trade Accounts shall each be prepared in accordance with the
Intercompany Accounts Provisions and, to the extent not inconsistent
therewith, the Seller Accounting Guideline; (iv) with respect to Estimated
Closing Net Pension Liabilities and Closing Net Pension Liabilities, shall
each be prepared in accordance with the Pension Assets and Liabilities
Provisions and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the Seller
Accounting Guideline; and (v) with respect to the Estimated Closing Net Tax
Position and the Closing Net Tax Position, shall each be prepared in
accordance with the Tax Provisions and, to the extent not inconsistent
therewith, the Seller Accounting Guideline; and in each case the calculations
shall be made in a manner to avoid any duplication of entries across (A)
Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Estimated Closing Net
Financial Indebtedness, Estimated Closing Intercompany Trade Accounts,
Estimated Closing Net Pension Liabilities and Estimated Closing Net Tax
Position; and (B) Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Closing Net
Financial Indebtedness, Closing Intercompany Trade Accounts, and Closing Net
Pension Liabilities and Closing Net Tax Position.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Local Cash Refund_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that any consideration provided for in any Local Asset
Purchase Agreement (such consideration, " _Local Consideration_ "), if
applicable, shall be included in, and shall be payable as part of (and not in
addition to), the Transaction Consideration. Accordingly, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any Local Asset Purchase Agreement and
except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Purchaser and the Purchaser
Ancillary Counterparties shall have no obligation to deliver any separate
payment with regard to any Local Consideration.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that there are
certain jurisdictions in which consideration may be required to be paid
locally at the Closing in the applicable local currency either (i) pursuant to
applicable Law or (ii) by agreement between the Parties (the " _Local Payment
Countries_ "), and that such payment, and any adjustments thereto due to
payment of the Cash Adjustment Amount, shall be made pursuant to the
provisions of the applicable Local Agreement. The Parties agree that the
amount of any such payments made on or around the Closing Date (the " _Local
Closing Cash Payments_ ") shall be determined in Dollars and, if applicable
Law requires or the Parties mutually agree to, payment in a currency other
than Dollars, such Dollar amount shall be converted into such other currency
at the Reference Exchange Rate as of the date which is two (2) Business Days
prior to the date Seller Parent or its applicable Subsidiary receives such
Local Closing Cash Payment. Seller Parent shall, within two (2) Business Days
following receipt of all Purchaser Local Closing Cash Payments, pay to
Purchaser a refund in Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by Purchaser in an amount equal to the aggregate
value of all Purchaser Local Closing Cash Payments, in each case converted
into Dollars from the

 



     

 

 



 

applicable local currency at the Reference Exchange Rate as of the date such
Local Closing Cash Payment was received by Seller Parent or its applicable
Subsidiary.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Non-Assignability of Assets_.

 



 

(a) Each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) secure as
promptly as practicable all material Permits or Consents required in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) deliver required notices
to third parties required in connection with the Contemplated Transactions,
(iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and (iv) take any other necessary actions, including initiating or
defending any Proceeding in relation to any action seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the Contemplated Transactions. Without
limiting the foregoing, (A) Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable prior to the Closing the Seller Required Approvals and (B)
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable prior to the Closing the
Purchaser Required Approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (A) (x) except for the Seller Required Approvals, Seller Parent
shall not be required to request a Permit or Consent from any third party if
Seller Parent reasonably believes that such request would materially and
adversely affect Seller Parents relationship with such third party with
respect to any of Seller Parents businesses other than the Business and (y)
the failure to obtain any Permit or Consent shall not in and of itself be a
breach of this Agreement by Seller Parent and (B) (x) except for the Purchaser
Required Approvals and the Regulatory Clearances, Purchaser shall not be
required to request a Permit or Consent from any third party if Purchaser
reasonably believes that such request would materially and adversely affect
Purchasers relationship with such third party with respect to its businesses
and (y) the failure to obtain any Permit or Consent shall not in and of itself
be a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that (i) the consummation of Contemplated Transactions requires any
Permits or Consents under any Business Contract or Business Lease, and such
Permits or Consents shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, or (ii)
the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted
sale, sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Purchaser of
any asset that would be a Transferred Asset (other than any Business Contract
or a Business Lease which is a Transferred Asset) or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any
applicable Law or would require any Permits or Consents, and such Permits or
Consents shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, then the Closing
shall nevertheless proceed (without the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of any asset referred to above) unless such failure
causes a failure of any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article
VIII, in which event the Closing shall proceed only if the failed condition is
waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof. In the event
that the Closing proceeds without the applicable Consent or Permit having been
obtained, then (A) such Contracts or assets shall be regarded as

 



     

 

 



 

included in the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount, or Closing Net
Pension Liabilities, if applicable, for purposes of the calculations required
under Section 2.10 (except to the extent that the benefit of such assets
cannot effectively be provided to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.12(b)),
and (B) following the Closing, the Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such Permits or
Consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates, nor Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to make any payment in connection with obtaining
any Permits or Consents (other than filing, recordation or similar fees which,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be shared equally by
Seller Parent and Purchaser), initiate any claims or agree to or execute any
changes to any Contract in connection with its obligations under this Section
2.12(b). To the extent that, with the other Partys prior written consent,
either Party incurs any out-of-pocket costs in order to secure any Permit or
Consent, then the other Party shall promptly reimburse the Party which
incurred such costs for fifty percent (50%) of any such costs. Pending such
Permit or Consent, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other to agree to any reasonable and lawful arrangements
designed to provide (i) to Purchaser and/or its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Entities) the benefits and burdens of use of such Contract or
asset and (ii) to Seller Parent and the Retained Subsidiaries the benefits,
including any indemnities, that they would have obtained had the applicable
Contract or asset been sold, assigned, subleased, transferred, conveyed or
delivered to Purchaser at the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller
Parent shall be deemed to be Purchasers duly appointed agent, and shall act
at Purchasers direction, for the sole purpose of completing, fulfilling and
discharging all of Purchasers rights and obligations with respect to any
Transferred Asset of a type described in the first sentence of this Section
2.12(b). Once the required Permit or Consent is obtained, Seller Parent shall,
or shall cause the relevant Retained Subsidiaries to, sell, assign, sublease,
transfer, convey and deliver such Contract or asset to Purchaser at no
additional cost. To the extent that any such Permit or Consent cannot be
obtained within twelve (12) months following the Closing pursuant to this
Section 2.12(b), then Purchaser and Seller Parent shall, subject to applicable
Law and any restrictions under Permits or Consents, enter into commercially
reasonable arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting)
to provide to the Parties the economic (taking into account Tax costs and
benefits) and operational equivalent of obtaining such Permit or Consent and
the performance by Purchaser of the obligations thereunder. Seller Parent
shall hold in trust for and pay to Purchaser promptly upon receipt thereof,
all income, proceeds and other monies (including any Tax refunds and Tax
Benefits) received by Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with its use of any Contract or asset (net of any Taxes and any other
reasonable out-of-pocket costs imposed upon Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) in connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.12(b).
Seller Parent will vis-a-vis the third party ( _im Au ßenverhaltnis_) remain
the party to any such Contract (any such Contract, a " _Non-Transferring
Contract_ "), and Seller Parent and Purchaser shall, for the purpose of their
internal relationship ( _im Innenverh altnis_), to the extent permitted under
applicable Law and the terms and conditions of the applicable Contract, behave
and treat each other as if the transfer and assumption of the Non-Transferring
Contract had effectively taken place with economic and legal effect as of the

 



     

 

 



 

Closing Date, and shall enter into any agreement reasonably required to
achieve that end. Seller Parent will act for Purchaser as a commission agent (
_Kommission ar_). The terms of such commission arrangement (including its VAT
treatment) will be set out in the Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.13 _Mixed Contracts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, none of this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements shall constitute an assignment or transfer of the
Mixed Contracts except to the extent contemplated by this Section 2.13.
Purchaser and Seller Parent shall, subject to Section 2.12, use their
reasonable best efforts to assign or transfer (a) those portions of the Mixed
Contracts that are Related to the Business to the extent so Related to the
Business to Purchaser and (b) those portions of the Mixed Contracts that are
not Related to the Business to Seller Parent, in each case if so assignable or
transferable, or appropriately amend the Mixed Contracts or replace with
separate Contracts, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date,
so that each of Purchaser and Seller Parent or their respective Affiliates
shall be entitled to the rights and benefits and shall assume the related
portion of any Liabilities inuring to their respective Businesses. If any
Mixed Contract cannot be so assigned, transferred, amended or replaced,
Purchaser and Seller Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause:
(i) the benefits associated with that portion of such Mixed Contract that is
Related to the Business, the Transferred Assets and/or the Assumed Liabilities
to be enjoyed by Purchaser and its Affiliates; (ii) the obligations associated
with that portion of such Mixed Contract that is Related to the Business, the
Transferred Assets and/or the Assumed Liabilities to be borne by Purchaser and
its Affiliates; (iii) the benefits associated with that portion of each Mixed
Contract that is not Related to the Business to be enjoyed by Seller Parent or
any Retained Subsidiary; and (iv) the obligations associated with that portion
of each Mixed Contract that is not Related to the Business to be borne by
Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts
to take all actions and prepare all documents necessary to effect the
assignment, transfer, amendment or replacement of all Mixed Contracts
necessary to comply with this Section 2.13. From Closing until the date that
is one (1) year after the Closing Date, each of Purchaser and Seller Parent
shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to cause the terms of any
assigned or transferred Mixed Contract or any amended or replacement Contract
to Purchaser and its Affiliates to be on terms no less favorable to either
Party than the terms of Seller Parents and its Subsidiaries applicable Mixed
Contract as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.14 _Affiliate Acquisitions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser may elect to have any or all
of the Transferred Assets and/or Seller Shares conveyed or transferred to, or
any of the Assumed Liabilities assumed by, one or more of its Affiliates
(each, an " _Affiliate Purchaser_ ") so long as (i) except for any withholding
Taxes which are the subject of Section 2.15, no such conveyance or transfer
results in any greater cost, Taxes or obligation than Seller Parent or any
Retained Subsidiary would otherwise have incurred, (ii) no such conveyance or
transfer would materially impair or delay the consummation of any of the
Contemplated Transactions and (iii) no such conveyance or transfer would
unduly complicate, delay or impair the receipt of any Seller Required
Approvals, any

 



     

 

 



 

Purchaser Required Approvals or any other Permits needed to effect the
Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such conveyance or transfer
shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations to Seller Parent and its
Subsidiaries hereunder with respect to the Assumed Liabilities or otherwise.
The Transaction Consideration shall be allocated among those Transferred
Assets and Seller Shares to be conveyed to Purchaser and those Transferred
Assets and Seller Shares to be conveyed to the respective Affiliate Purchaser,
but in no event shall the amount of the Transaction Consideration or any other
items to be paid for the Transferred Assets, the Seller Shares, the nature of
the Assumed Liabilities to be assumed, the obligation to pay Taxes or Transfer
Taxes or the allocation of risk and responsibility between Seller Parent and
Purchaser be modified to the detriment of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries
as a result of the delivery of separate bills of sale, assignments and other
closing documents.

 



 

Section 2.15 _Withholding Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 2.15(b), any payment by Purchaser of any amount
specified in this Agreement shall be paid free and clear of, and without any
deduction or withholding on account of or in relation to, any Tax; _provided_
, _however_ , that Seller Parent shall provide Purchaser with any statements,
forms or other documents reasonably requested by Purchaser to reduce or
eliminate such deduction or withholding. The Parties agree to take
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to eliminate or reduce any such
deduction or withholding.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
Section 2.15(a)) or any Local Agreement, to the extent that (i) Seller Shares
or Transferred Assets are acquired pursuant to this Agreement by an Affiliate
of Purchaser that is organized and tax-resident in the same country as the
relevant Share Seller, Retained Subsidiary, Transferred Entity or Transferred
Assets, or (ii) Seller Shares or Transferred Assets are acquired pursuant to
this Agreement by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser organized in the
United States, Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts allocable to such transfers and otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or to any Local Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld under applicable Tax Law or according to an order issued
by a Government Entity after following the procedures specified in Section
2.15(c).

 



 

(c) Except for any amounts that are withheld by reason of the failure to
provide the certificate described in Section 2.8(b)(vi), to the extent that
Section 2.15(b) applies to a payment, if Purchaser believes that any
withholding of Tax is required with respect to any payment under this
Agreement or any Local Agreement, then Purchaser shall give written notice to
Seller Parent, if applicable, or the applicable Subsidiary of Seller Parent
describing the basis for such withholding in reasonable detail at least twenty
(20) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall provide
Seller Parent or such Subsidiary of Seller Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to provide any applicable certificate, form or documentation that
would reduce or eliminate the requirement to deduct and withhold Tax with
respect to such payment, and Purchaser shall otherwise cooperate with Seller
Parent or the applicable Subsidiary of Seller Parent and take such steps as
Seller Parent or such Subsidiary of Seller Parent may reasonably

 



     

 

 



 

request to reduce or eliminate such withholding obligation to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) To the extent that amounts are deducted and withheld pursuant to Section
2.15(b): (i) such deducted and withheld amounts shall be timely remitted by
Purchaser to the applicable Government Entity, (ii) such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement or any Local
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made, and such Person shall not be entitled to claim a
gross-up in respect of such amounts, and (iii) full evidence of such payment
to the applicable Governmental Entity and any further documentation that is
reasonably requested by Seller Parent and available to Purchaser shall be as
promptly as practicable forwarded by Purchaser to Seller Parent.

 



 

(e) To the extent that Purchaser has paid any additional amounts to Seller
Parent under Section 2.15(a), Seller Parent is obliged to promptly pay to
Purchaser the amount of any (i) Tax Refunds of the relevant withholding Taxes
or (ii) such relevant withholding Taxes for which Seller Parent or any
Affiliate of Seller Parent receives a credit or offset against its Tax
liability. The amount of any payments to Purchaser pursuant to this Section
2.15(e), shall not be subject to Section 7.1(c).

 



 

Section 2.16 _Post-Closing Payment_. Following the Closing, the Parties shall
perform the covenants set forth in Section 2.16 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

 



 

 _ARTICLE III_

 



 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER PARENT_

 



 

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller Parent
represents and warrants to Purchaser, by way of an independent guarantee
irrespective of fault ( _verschuldensunabh angig_) pursuant to Section 311 (1)
German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch  BGB_), as of the date of this
Agreement and, with respect only to the Seller Fundamental Representations, as
of the Closing Date, as follows; _provided_ that it is understood and agreed
that any such representation and warranty which expressly speaks as of a
particular date or period of time shall be deemed to be true and correct as of
the date of this Agreement and, with respect only to the Seller Fundamental
Representations, as of the Closing Date, if it was true and correct as of such
particular date or period of time.

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Seller Parent is a stock
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of Germany and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on such portion of
the Business as it currently conducts. Seller Parent is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
where the ownership or operation of the Transferred Assets or the conduct of
its portion of the Business requires such qualification, except for failures
to be so qualified or in good standing, as the case may be, that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, (A) have a material adverse effect on the
assets,

 



     

 

 



 

liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Business,
taken as a whole, or (B) prevent, materially delay or materially impair Seller
Parents ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Subsidiaries_. Each Share Seller, each Transferred Entity and
each Retained Subsidiary of Seller Parent which has title to any Transferred
Asset is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws
of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its portion of the Business as currently conducted. Each Share
Seller, each Transferred Entity and each Retained Subsidiary of Seller Parent
which has title to any Transferred Asset is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of the Business Assets or the
conduct of the Business requires such qualification, except, in each case, for
failures to be so qualified or in good standing that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Business,
taken as a whole.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Capitalization of the Transferred Entities_. Annex 4 sets forth a
correct and complete list of each Transferred Entity, listing for each such
Transferred Entity its name, its jurisdiction of organization, its authorized
equity interests, the number and type of its issued and outstanding equity
interests and the current record and beneficial ownership of such equity
interests. The Seller Shares and the equity interests of each other
Transferred Entity are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and owned beneficially and of record by the Person set forth
opposite such equity interests on Annex 4, free and clear of all Encumbrances,
other than transfer restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws. Except
for the Seller Shares and any equity interest held by a Transferred Entity,
there are no shares of common stock, preferred stock or other equity interests
of any Transferred Entity issued or outstanding, and there are no preemptive
or other outstanding rights, subscriptions, options, warrants, conversion
rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate any Transferred Entity to issue or to sell any shares of capital
stock or other securities or other ownership interest in such Transferred
Entity or any other securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for, valued by reference to or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of any Transferred Entity, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. No Share Seller or Transferred Entity is a party to any voting
trusts, proxies, or other shareholder or similar agreements or understandings
with respect to the voting, purchase, repurchase or transfer of its respective
Seller Shares or other equity interests. None of the Transferred Entities has
any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations that provide the
holders thereof the right to vote (or are convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of
such Transferred Entity on any matter. No Transferred Entity is under any
obligation, or is bound by any Contract pursuant to which it may become
obligated to, (i) declare, make or pay any dividends or distributions, whether
current or accumulated or due or payable, or (ii) make any loan to,

 



     

 

 



 

investment in, or capital contribution to, any Person.

of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or by any Seller Ancillary
Counterparty in connection with the execution and delivery by such Seller
Ancillary Counterparty of the Applicable Ancillary Agreements or the
performance of its obligations thereunder, other than those the failure of
which to obtain, give or make that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, (A) have a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities,
financial condition or results of operations of the Business, taken as a
whole, or (B) prevent, materially delay or materially impair Seller Parents
or any Seller Ancillary Counterpartys ability to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by Seller Parent
of this Agreement and the Applicable Ancillary Agreements and the performance
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the execution and delivery by
each Seller Ancillary Counterparty of each Applicable Ancillary Agreement and
the performance of its obligations thereunder do not and will not: (i) violate

any of its Subsidiaries which is a party thereto under, or result in a loss of
any benefit to which Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which is a party
thereto is entitled under, any

 



     

 

 



 

Material Contract, or the creation of any Encumbrance upon the Seller Shares
or the Business Assets, or (iii) assuming the receipt of the Seller Required
Approvals and the making of any filings or notifications described in Section
3.5(i) and Section 3.5(ii), violate or result in a breach of or constitute a
default under applicable Law to which Seller Parent or any Subsidiary of
Seller Parent (including any Seller Ancillary Counterparty) is subject, or
under any Business Permit or Business Product Authorization, other than, in
the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), conflicts, breaches, terminations,
defaults, cancellations, modifications, accelerations, losses, violations or
Encumbrances that would not, individually or in the aggregate, (A) have a
material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, financial condition or
results of operations of the Business, taken as a whole, or (B) prevent,
materially delay or materially impair Seller Parents or any Seller Ancillary
Counterpartys ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements, when duly and validly executed and delivered by Purchaser and the
Purchaser Ancillary Counterparties, constitute valid and legally binding
obligations of Seller Parent and of each Seller Ancillary Counterparty,
enforceable against Seller Parent and each Seller Ancillary Counterparty in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity

foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership
or operation of its properties and assets or the conduct of its businesses
require such qualification, except, in each case, for failures to be so
qualified or in good standing that would not (A) individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities,
financial condition or results of operations of the business of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions.

Purchaser on any matter. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill,"
anti-takeover plan or other similar device in effect applicable to the

Counterparty in connection with the execution and delivery by such Purchaser
Ancillary Counterparty of the Applicable Ancillary Agreements or the
performance of its obligations thereunder, other than those the failure of

materially impair the ability of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions.

(ii) assuming the receipt of all Seller Antitrust Clearances and Purchaser
Antitrust Clearances, the Purchaser Required Approvals, conflict with, or
result in the breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration (whether after the
filing of notice or the lapse of time or both) of any right or obligation of

Section 4.7 _Purchaser SEC Filings_.

 



 

(a) Since September 24, 2018 (the " _Emerald IPO Date_ "), Purchaser has filed
or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, registration
statements, prospectuses, reports, certifications, schedules, and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including all exhibits thereto and any
other information incorporated by reference therein) (such documents filed or
furnished to the SEC and those filed or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Purchaser SEC
Filings_ "). Each of the Purchaser SEC Filings, at the time of its filing or
being furnished, complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in
all material respects, with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of their respective dates (or,
if amended, as of the date of such amendment), the Purchaser SEC Filings did
not, and any Purchaser SEC Filings filed with or furnished to the SEC
subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated income statements
included in or incorporated by reference into the Purchaser SEC Filings

 



     

 

 



 

(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case

present, in all material respects, the financial position and results of
operations of the business and operations of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as

GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein or in the notes thereto.

 



 

(c) Purchaser maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by Purchaser is recorded and reported on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Purchasers
filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. Purchaser
maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting is effective, in all material respects, in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

U.S. GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Purchaser, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of Purchaser are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Purchaser, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Purchasers assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. The records, systems, controls,
Data and information of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that are used in the
systems of disclosure controls and procedures and of financial reporting
controls and procedures described above are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Purchaser or its accountants or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Purchaser.

 



 

(d) Purchaser has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief
executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this
Agreement, to Purchasers auditors and the audit committee of the Purchaser
Board (i) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Purchasers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and has identified for Purchasers auditors and audit
committee of the Purchaser Board any material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Purchasers internal control over financial reporting. Purchaser has made
available to Seller Parent (x) a summary of any such disclosure made by
management to Purchasers auditors and audit committee since the Emerald IPO
Date and (y) any material communication made by management or Purchasers
auditors since the Emerald IPO Date to the audit committee required or
contemplated by listing standards of the NYSE, the audit committees charter
or

 



     

 

 



 

professional standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since
the Emerald IPO Date, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, no material complaints
from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters, and no concerns from Purchaser employees regarding questionable
accounting or auditing matters, have been received by Purchaser. Purchaser has

Section 4.12 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser has provided to Seller Parent a complete and correct copy of a
fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (as the
same may be amended or replaced in accordance with Section 5.4, and including
any executed debt commitment letter or similar agreement for Alternative
Financing entered into in accordance with Section 5.4 and all exhibits,
schedules and annexes thereto, collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_
"), from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto, pursuant to which such Debt
Financing Sources have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
provide the amount of debt financing stated therein (collectively, the " _Debt
Financing_ "), and the fee letter related thereto (except that the fee
amounts, "flex" terms and other economic terms may be redacted so long as no
redaction covers terms that would reduce the aggregate principal amount of the
Debt Financing or adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability,
availability or termination of the Debt Financing) (such fee letter, the "
_Fee Letter_ ").

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Assuming (i) the accuracy in all material aspects of the representations
and warranties set forth in Article III, (ii) the satisfaction of the
conditions contained in Section 8.1, Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.2(d) and
(iii) the performance in all material respects by Seller Parent of its
obligations under this Agreement, the Debt Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, will provide, together with
available cash of Purchaser, Purchaser with net cash proceeds on the Closing
Date in an amount sufficient to consummate the Contemplated Transactions,
including the payment of the Cash Consideration Amount, and to pay related
fees and expenses (such amount, the " _Required Payment Amount_ ") and
assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter, as of the Closing Date, Purchaser will have all of the funds necessary
to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and pay the Required Payment
Amount.

 



 

(c) There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing, other than those expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. Other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, there are no agreements, side letters, arrangements or understandings
(except for the Fee Letter, a copy of which has been provided to Seller Parent
(which has been redacted as described above)) that would, or would reasonably
be expected to, (i) impair the enforceability of the Debt Commitment Letter,
(ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the level

conditions precedent to the Debt Financing, or (iv) otherwise adversely

and enforceable against Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each of
the other parties thereto, in accordance with its terms (subject to the

Fee Letter is in full force and effect, and no event has occurred that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent
on the part of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party
thereto, under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Fee Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Debt Commitment
Letter nor the Fee Letter has been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived in any manner, the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
have not been terminated, withdrawn, modified or rescinded and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, no such amendment, restatement, modification, waiver,
termination, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated (other than to add or
replace lenders, financial institutions, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or other similar entities in the manner contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter). As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will fail to be satisfied
on the Closing Date or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter will not be available to be funded on the Closing Date.
Purchaser has paid or caused to

 



     

 

 



 

be paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees or expenses that are
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter on or
before the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that it shall not be a condition to the obligation of
Purchaser to consummate the Closing that (i) Purchaser has obtained the Debt
Financing or any other Financing or (ii) Purchaser otherwise has sufficient
funds for payment of the Cash Consideration Amount or any other portion of the
Required Payment Amount.

Transactions, payment of all related fees and expenses and consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions (including the incurrence of the Debt Financing and
payment of the Required Payment Amount), Purchaser will be Solvent as of and
immediately following the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Solvent_ ," when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date
of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of
such person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors and (ii) the amount that
will be required to pay the probable Liabilities of such Person as such debts
become absolute and mature, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities as they mature.

 



 

Section 4.14 _Finders  Fees_. There is no investment banker, broker, finder
or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates who might be entitled to any fee
or commission from Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Transaction.

 



 

Section 4.15 _Tax Matters Agreement_. The execution and delivery by Purchaser
of this Agreement and the Applicable Ancillary Agreements and the performance
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the execution and delivery by
each Purchaser Ancillary Counterparty of each Applicable Ancillary Agreement
and the performance of its obligations thereunder does not and will not: (i)
constitute a breach of any covenant contained in Section 6.01 of the Tax
Matters Agreement or (ii) cause Purchaser to incur a liability pursuant to
Section 6.04(a) of the Tax Matters Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.16 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, neither Purchaser
nor any other Person makes any other representation or warranty, express or
implied, at law or in equity, in respect of Purchaser, its Subsidiaries, or
the business and operations or the assets of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries. Any such other representation or warranty is hereby expressly
disclaimed.

Agreement and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, Purchaser has
relied solely upon the representations and warranties of Seller Parent set

within the meaning of Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of
United States state or local Law) with any United States federal, state or
local Tax authority, or (J) adopt or change any material Tax accounting
principle, method, period or practice, if such action or inaction described in
(A) through (J) would reasonably be expected to materially increase any Tax
liability of a Transferred Entity (after taking into account the indemnities
and other provisions in Article VII) for any taxable period or portion of a
Straddle Period that, in each case, ends after the Closing Accounts Time;
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that for purposes of this Section
5.2(a)(xviii), any increase in a Tax liability that is an Excluded Tax subject
to the indemnity under Section 7.1(a) and any reduction in a Tax asset that is

expected to materially increase any Tax liability of a Transferred Entity;

Section 5.3 _Regulatory Clearances_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall take all lawful actions to obtain as promptly as
practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date) the Regulatory
Clearances, shall promptly undertake any and all actions necessary or
appropriate to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened
prohibition or commencement of any other action by or on behalf of any
Applicable Authority with respect to any Regulatory Clearance and shall
proffer to any Applicable Authority to take such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate in order to obtain all Regulatory Clearances as soon as
practicable (but in any event prior to the Outside Date), including (i)
agreeing promptly to effect any Divestiture Action that any Applicable
Authority shall require, propose, offer or impose ( _provided_ that such
Divestiture Action shall be conditioned on the occurrence of, and shall become
effective only from and after, the Closing), (ii) agreeing promptly to comply
with any commitment, consent decree, Encumbrance, mitigation agreement and any
other condition or operating restriction with respect to any businesses,
product lines, tangible or intangible assets, Intellectual Property,

Applicable Authority may require, propose, offer or impose and (iii) defending
any Proceeding (including any Proceeding seeking a temporary restraining order
or preliminary injunction) and initiating any appropriate Proceeding against
any Applicable Authority which acts, seeks, proposes or threatens to prevent,
delay or impair the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to,
and without limiting the obligations of, the Parties set forth in Sections
5.3(b) and 5.3(c), except as specifically set forth in Section 5.3(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for, and
Seller Parent shall have no obligations with respect to, the planning,
structuring (including tax structuring) or implementation of any Divestiture
Action; _provided_ that in connection with the Divestiture Actions described
in Section 5.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take the
actions set forth in Section 5.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. No
Partys obligations under this Section 5.3 or the performance hereof shall
entitle such Party to any adjustment or modification of the Transaction
Consideration or any other terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall (i) as promptly as practicable following the execution
of this Agreement make all filings and submissions to Government Entities
required or advisable under applicable Law (including Antitrust Laws) in order
to effect the Contemplated Transactions and (ii) promptly file any additional
information requested by any Government Entity in connection therewith as soon
as practicable after receipt of such request therefor. Each Party shall
cooperate with the other Party and shall furnish to the other Party all
information necessary or desirable in connection with any Regulatory
Clearance, and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
by any Government Entity with respect thereto; _provided_ that in no event
shall either Party have access to any information of the other Party that (x)
based on advice of such other Partys counsel, would violate or create any
potential Liability under applicable

 



     

 

 



 

Law, including Antitrust Laws, or would impair the exercise of any legal
privilege or (y) in the reasonable judgment of such other Party, would (iii)
result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of such other Party or (iv)
violate any obligation of such other Party with respect to confidentiality or
data protection requirements; _provided_ that where access to information
cannot be provided due to the exceptions set forth in the foregoing clauses
(x) or (y), to the extent permitted under applicable Law, such other Party
shall make available such information in connection with any filing on an
outside counsel-to-counsel basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
shall, following consultation with Seller Parent and after considering Seller
Parents views in good faith, and subject to Purchasers obligations under
this Section 5.3, direct and control all aspects of the Parties efforts to
obtain any Regulatory Clearance in any Proceeding brought to enjoin the
Contemplated Transactions pursuant to any Antitrust Laws, and Seller Parent
shall cooperate in good faith with Purchaser in the Parties efforts to obtain
any Regulatory Clearance in any Proceeding brought to enjoin the Contemplated
Transactions pursuant to any Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , that each of the
Parties shall (i) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
the other Party and its respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials (including
correspondence) submitted to, any third party or any Government Entity in
connection with any Proceeding with respect to the Contemplated Transactions,
(ii) promptly inform each other of any material communication (or any other
material correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, any
Government Entity and (iii) promptly furnish each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them or their
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Government Entity or its respective
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Contemplated Transactions. The
Parties shall (with respect to any in-person discussion or meeting), and shall
to the extent practicable (with respect to any telephonic discussion or
meeting), provide the other Party and its counsel with advance notice of and
the opportunity to participate in any material discussion or meeting with any
Government Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

(c) In addition to, and without limiting the generality of, the obligations in
Section 5.3(a) with respect to each Regulatory Clearance, subject to Section
5.3(b):

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (A) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, if and to the extent
customary with respect to such Regulatory Clearance, submit a draft Regulatory
Notice to the Applicable Authority, and promptly address and resolve any
questions and comments received on the draft Regulatory Notice from the
Applicable Authority; (B) promptly prepare and submit the final Regulatory
Notice to the Applicable Authority; and (C) take all lawful action to obtain
the Completion of Regulatory Process as promptly as reasonably practicable,
and promptly undertake and agree to any mitigation agreement or condition
required by any Applicable Authority, Applicable Executive or other Government
Entity in order to mitigate any concerns identified in relation to the
Transaction, and Purchaser shall, to the extent possible, be solely
responsible for the actions described in this Section 5.3(c)(i);

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, (A) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, provide
all necessary information needed to submit the Regulatory Notice to the
Applicable Authority; (B) provide any information requested by any Applicable
Authority or any other Government Entity in connection with its review or
investigation of the Transaction, within the time periods specified under
applicable Law or otherwise provided by the Applicable Authority, without the
need to request an extension of time except when reasonably necessary and
following consultation with the other Party in connection with the Parties
efforts to obtain the Completion of Regulatory Process; (C) cooperate in all
respects and consult with each other in connection with any Regulatory Notice,
including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to
review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions in relation
to such Regulatory Notice; (D) promptly inform the other Party of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any
Applicable Authority in connection with such Regulatory Notice, by promptly
providing copies to the other Party of any such written communications, except
for any personal identifying information; and (E) permit the other Party to
review in advance any communication that it gives to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with
any Applicable Authority, and give the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in any meetings, substantive telephone calls or conferences
with any Applicable Authority (to the extent not prohibited by the Applicable
Authority) in connection with any Regulatory Notice, in each of clauses (C),
(D) and (E), subject to confidentiality considerations contemplated under
applicable Law or as may be required by the relevant Applicable Authority in
connection with any Regulatory Notice. In addition, with regard to any meeting
or substantive conversation, a Party need not be represented or notified by
the other Party if any Government Entity objects to the Partys being
represented at, or notified of, as applicable, any such meeting or any such
conversation.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement including
Article VII, any incremental Taxes of Seller Parent Group (including, solely
for the purpose of this Section 5.3(d), the cost of any tax loss carryforwards
and similar Tax attributes that are consumed by a Divestiture Action) that
arise in connection with any Divestiture Action shall be borne solely by
Purchaser and its Affiliates. For purposes of this Section 5.3(d), Taxes
(including, solely for the purpose of this Section 5.3(d), the cost of any tax
loss carryforwards and similar Tax attributes that are consumed by a
Divestiture Action) are "incremental" unless such Taxes would have been borne
by Seller Parent Group in respect of the Contemplated Transactions had no
Divestiture Actions occurred.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 5.4(c), Seller Parent shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, at Purchasers sole cost and expense (other than costs
and expenses incurred in connection with preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements), use reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its and
their respective Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to
provide, all cooperation that is reasonably necessary

 



     

 

 



 

and reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with any debt and/or
equity financing by Purchaser (including the Debt Financing) in connection
with the Transaction (the " _Financing_ "), including using reasonable best
efforts to:

 



 

(i) furnish Purchaser with such financial and other information regarding the
Business and the Transferred Assets as Purchaser may reasonably request in
connection with any Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to
furnish (A) financial statements and financial data regarding the Business and
the Transferred Assets of the type that (1) would be required by Regulation
S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for an offering of high yield
secured debt securities or equity securities in a transaction registered on a
Form S-3 registration statement under the Securities Act or (2) are otherwise
reasonably necessary to permit Seller Parents independent accountants to
issue "comfort letters" in connection with the Financing, including as to
customary negative assurances and change period comfort, including (I) audited
combined statements of financial position and related statements of
operations, comprehensive income, shareowners equity and cash flows of the
Business, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2016 (each of which Purchaser acknowledges it has received as of
the date of this Agreement) and for any subsequent fiscal year of Seller
Parent ended at least seventy five (75) days prior to the Closing Date (within
seventy five (75) days after the end of each such subsequent fiscal year) and
(II) unaudited condensed combined statements of financial position and related
statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash
flows of the Business for any fiscal quarter of Seller Parent (beginning with
the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2019) and ended at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the Closing Date (within forty-five (45) days after the end
of each such fiscal quarter) (such subsequent unaudited condensed combined
financial statements, together with the subsequent audited combined financial
statements described above, the " _Subsequent Financial Statements_ ") and (B)
such other information, including financial data, as would be reasonably
necessary for Purchaser to prepare pro forma consolidated balance sheets and
related pro forma consolidated statements of income of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions and meeting the
requirements of Regulation S-X for a Form S-3 registration statement (it being
understood that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
neither Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to
provide or prepare any (u) pro forma financial statements, pro forma financial
information or projections, each of which Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for, (v) description of all or any portion of any Financing,
including any "description of notes," "plan of distribution" or information
customarily provided by the underwriters or initial purchasers of debt
securities or their counsel or advisors in the preparation of an offering

factors relating to all or any component of any Financing, (x) segment

Financing, other information customarily excluded from an offering memorandum

 



     

 

 



 

for an offering of high yield secured debt securities issued pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act);

 



 

(ii) assist Purchaser in the timely preparation of offering documents and
materials (and any supplement thereto), including registration statements,
prospectuses, investor presentations, rating agency materials and
presentations, and similar documents for any Financing, including by providing

permissible;

 



 

(iii) cooperate with legal counsel to Purchaser or any underwriter in

agreed times and locations, and upon reasonable notice;

 



 

(iv) upon Purchasers request, issue customary authorization letters and
customary representation letters to Seller Parents independent accountants
and use reasonable best efforts to cause such independent accountants, if
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with any Financing, to issue,
on customary terms and consistent with customary practice, customary audit
reports and customary comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort)
with respect to the financial information of the Business and consents to the
use of such accountants audit reports relating to the Business in SEC filings
to the extent such consents are required by Law;

 



 

(v) furnish Purchaser and any Debt Financing Source that is party to the Debt
Commitment Letter no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing

required by any Government Entity with respect to any Financing under
applicable Anti-Bribery Laws, Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Economic
Sanctions Laws;

 



 

(vi) provide Purchaser information reasonably requested thereby and reasonably
available to Seller Parent for purposes of Purchasers preparation of U.S.
GAAP reconciliations of financial statements provided by Seller Parent; and

 



 

(vii) cause appropriate members of management of Seller Parent and its
Subsidiaries to participate in a reasonable and limited number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, sessions with ratings agencies and drafting
sessions that are customary for financings of a type similar to the Financing
at reasonable and mutually agreed times and locations, and upon reasonable
notice; and

 



 

(viii) reasonably assist in the preparation, execution and delivery (limited,
in the case of execution and delivery, solely to officers continuing with the
Business after the Closing) of one or more credit agreements, indentures,
purchase agreements, pledge and security documents and other definitive
documentation and facilitating the granting of a security interest (and
perfection thereof) in collateral,

 



     

 

 



 

including obtaining releases of existing Encumbrances (to the extent otherwise
required by this Agreement), in each case, as of the Closing and as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser; _provided_ that any obligations and
releases of Encumbrances contained in all such agreements, documents and
related certificates and instruments shall be subject to the occurrence of the
Closing and become effective no earlier than the Closing.

 



 

(b) Seller Parent hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Section 5.4 or Section 5.21 shall require such
cooperation, and nothing herein shall require Seller Parent to take any
action, to the extent it would (i) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the
conduct of the Business or any other business or operations of Seller Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) require Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or cause any of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII not to be satisfied; (iii)
require Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees,
reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any monetary Liability prior to the
Closing Date unless Seller Parent shall have received reimbursement therefor;
(iv) require Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that

its Subsidiaries; (v) (A) require Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
take any action that, based on advice of Seller Parents counsel, would

Secrets of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or of third parties or
violate any obligation of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to confidentiality or data protection, or (2) the disclosure of any
information referencing the value of the Seller Parent or any of Seller
Parents Subsidiaries (other than the Business or the Business Assets), or (C)
reasonably be expected to cause the loss or waiver of the protection of any
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product privilege or other relevant
legal privilege; _provided_ that, in the case of the foregoing clauses (v)(A),
(B)(1) and (C), Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to find a suitable alternative to disclose information
in such a way that such disclosure does not violate any applicable Law,
disclose any such Trade Secrets or violate any confidentiality or data
protection obligations or cause the loss or waiver of such privilege, as
applicable; (vi) require Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any agreement or require their respective boards of directors or
equivalent governing bodies to pass resolutions or consents to approve or
authorize any such agreement (other than customary authorization or
representation letters or auditor engagement letters for purposes of effecting
the cooperation envisioned hereunder, including delivering comfort letters) or
any other document, instrument, action or transaction in connection with the
Financing; (vii) require Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its or their Representatives to deliver any certificate or take any other
action other than on behalf of Seller Parent or such Subsidiary (and not in
any personal capacity), and nothing herein shall require any Representative to

personal liability; (viii) require Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
prepare U.S. GAAP financial statements or reconciliations or otherwise provide
financial information in a format other than IFRS-IASB or (ix) require Seller
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to prepare quarterly or annual financial
statements for Seller Parent with a different fiscal quarter or fiscal year
end than Seller Parents current fiscal quarter and fiscal year end dates. In
addition, no action, Liability or obligation of Seller Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement or document relating to the Financing
(other than customary authorization or representation letters) will be
required to be effective until the Closing. Purchaser shall promptly, upon
request by Seller Parent, reimburse Seller Parent for all reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (whether internal or external, including
personnel expenses) incurred by Seller Parent in performing its obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.4 (including the costs and expenses of preparing
the Subsequent Financial Statements, including accountants fees, and
reasonable and documented outside counsel attorneys fees) or incurred by
Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
in connection with the Financing. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller Parent, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing and any
information used in connection therewith, except in the event such losses or
damages, claims, costs or expenses arise out of or result from (i) the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith by Seller Parent or its
Subsidiaries in fulfilling their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4 or
(ii) historical information provided to Purchaser in writing by Seller Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection with the
Financing containing any untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that Closing is not conditioned upon (i) Purchaser
obtaining the Debt Financing or any other Financing or (ii) Purchaser
otherwise having funds sufficient for payment of the Cash Consideration Amount
or any other portion of the Required Payment Amount, and Purchaser reaffirms
its obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Debt Financing or any other
Financing.

 



 

(e) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, as promptly as practicable,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Fee Letter (including the "flex" provisions of the Fee Letter) and to
arrange and obtain any other Financing as and to the extent required to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions and to pay the Required Payment
Amount on or prior to the Closing Date, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters and any
commitment or definitive financing documentation entered into in connection
with any Financing (such documentation, together with the Debt Commitment
Letter, the " _Financing Documentation_ ") until the Contemplated Transactions
are consummated, (ii) satisfy, or

 



     

 

 



 

cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis, or obtain a waiver of, all
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter and any other Financing Documentation
executed in connection therewith or with any Financing and otherwise complying
with its obligations thereunder, (iii) negotiate, execute and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and definitive agreements with respect to
any other Financing; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the documentation relating to the bridge loan facility shall not be
required until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt
Financing, (iv) consummate the Debt Financing and any other Financing at or
prior to the Closing, (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter
and any other Financing Documentation, and (vi) in the event that all
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter and any other Financing Documentation
have been satisfied or waived by the applicable parties thereto, cause the
Persons providing the Financing (including the Debt Financing) to fund on the
Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions. To the extent requested by Seller Parent from time to time,
Purchaser shall keep Seller Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (including the Debt Financing) and provide Seller Parent with
complete, correct and executed copies of any material Financing Documentation.
Purchaser shall give Seller Parent prompt notice: (A) of the execution of any
Financing Documentation; (B) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) of any party to
the Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing Documentation of which Purchaser
becomes aware; (C) of any oral or written notice or other oral or written
communication from any Person with respect to any: (1) actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any other Financing Documentation or any provisions of
the Debt Commitment Letter or any other Financing Documentation or (2)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any other Financing Documentation, in each case which
would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to
obtain all or any part of the Debt Financing on the terms and in the manner
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the applicable Financing
Documentation; (D) of any expiration or termination of the Debt Commitment
Letter or any other Financing Documentation; and (E) if for any reason
Purchaser believes in good faith that (1) there is (or there is likely to be)
a dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any other Financing Documentation which would reasonably be expected
to adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to obtain all or any part of the
Debt Financing on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or the applicable Financing Documentation or (2) there is a
material likelihood that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of
the Debt Financing or any other Financing on the terms, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the applicable
Financing Documentation.

 



 

(f) Purchaser shall not, without Seller Parents prior written consent, permit
or consent to any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver to be made to
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or any Financing Documentation if
such

 



     

 

 



 

amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to
(i) impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, (ii) reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing or any other Financing to an amount below the
amount necessary to satisfy the Required Payment Amount (after taking into
account available cash of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries at the Closing),
(iii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or any other
Financing in a manner adverse to Purchaser or which would reasonably be
expected to have the result, effect or consequence described in any of clause
(i), (ii) or (iv) of this sentence or (iv) otherwise adversely affect the
ability of Purchaser to timely consummate the Contemplated Transactions or
adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the applicable
Financing Documentation (including any right to seek or obtain specific
performance of the Debt Commitment Letter); _provided_ that, for the avoidance
of doubt, Purchaser may amend, supplement, modify or waive any terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter and/or the Financing Documentation related thereto
without the consent of Seller Parent in order to (1) correct typographical
errors or (2) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities (by assignment or otherwise) subject to the terms and
restrictions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
of this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly furnish to Seller Parent true and
complete copies of any amendment, replacement, supplement, modification,
consent or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter or any material Financing
Documentation. For the purposes of this Agreement, and subject to Section
4.12(a), references to the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall include such
document(s) as permitted or required by this Section 5.4(f) to be amended,
supplemented, modified or waived, in each case from and after such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver.

 



 

(g) In the event of any event or circumstance that causes any portion of the
Financing to be unavailable on the terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including, as necessary, any "flex" terms applicable thereto or any
related Fee Letter) or the applicable Financing Documentation (any such event
or circumstance, a " _Financing Failure Event_ "), Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, alternative
financing, including from alternative sources, in an amount sufficient to
satisfy the Required Payment Amount (after taking into account the available
cash of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries at the Closing) (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
Financing Failure Event, (i) on (A) economic terms taken as a whole and (ii)
other terms, in each case, that are not materially less favorable in the
aggregate to Purchaser than the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter (including
any "flex" terms applicable thereto) or the applicable Financing
Documentation, as the case may be, and (ii) containing conditions to draw and
conditions to Closing and other terms that would reasonably be expected to
affect the availability thereof that are not more onerous in any respect than
those conditions and terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and related
Fee Letter, and that would not reasonably be expected to materially delay the
Closing or make the Closing materially less likely to occur. The provisions of
this Section 5.4(g) and Section 11.15 shall be applicable to the Alternative
Financing, and, for the purposes of this

 



      

 

 



 

Section 5.4(g), and Section 11.15, all references to the Financing shall be
deemed to include such Alternative Financing, all references to Financing
Documentation shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative
Financing, and all references to the Debt Financing Sources shall include the
Persons providing or arranging the Alternative Financing. In the event
Purchaser has obtained substitute financing, the proceeds of which are
received on the Closing Date and which amount substitutes an equivalent
portion of the Debt Financing, for the purposes of Section 4.12 and this
Section 5.4, all references to the Financing shall be deemed to include such
substitute financing.

to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall take all lawful actions to cause the Consideration Shares,

free of any preemptive rights of subscription or purchase or similar rights in
respect thereof.

this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions is (i) brought, or, to
Purchasers Knowledge, threatened, against Purchaser or any members of the
Purchaser Board or (ii) brought, or, to Seller Parents Knowledge, threatened,
against Seller Parent or any members of the supervisory board or board of
management of Seller Parent, in each case from and following the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (such litigation, " _Related
Litigation_ "), Purchaser or Seller Parent, as applicable, shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable notify the other Party of such Related Litigation
and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed with respect to the status
thereof. Each Party shall give the other Party the opportunity to participate
in the defense or settlement of any Related Litigation and shall consider in
good faith the other Partys advice with respect to such Related Litigation;
_provided_ that the Party against whom the Related Litigation is brought shall
in any event control such defense or settlement and the disclosure of
information to the other Party in connection therewith shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 5.1 and Section 5.3.

Seller Shares or the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, or the retention of the Excluded Assets and the Excluded
Liabilities, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, if
and only if a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with

covenant, such Party agrees to pay, in addition to such other damages as the
other Party or its current or former Affiliates and their respective

agents, Representatives and employees may sustain as a result of such
violation, all attorneys fees and costs incurred by the other Party or its
current or former Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,
Representatives and employees, as a result of such violation, and such current
or former Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, shareholders,
partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents, Representatives and
employees are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of the foregoing rights
against such Party.

 



 

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that no party to any Local Agreement shall have any Liability
under such Local Agreement except to the extent (i) necessary to specifically
enforce the terms of this Agreement (including the payment of any Purchaser
Local Closing Cash Payments or Seller Parent Local Closing Cash Payments
pursuant to any Local Asset Purchase Agreement) and (ii) set forth in the
proviso in Section 5.9(b) above.

arrangements and the

 



     

 

 



 

settling of intercompany loans accounts), in the case of each of clause (i)
and (ii), following notice to Purchaser, which may propose a revision with
respect to such settlement or elimination. If Purchaser makes any request for
revision, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall consider such proposed revision in
good faith; _provided_ , that Seller Parent shall have no obligation to accept
any such proposed revision with respect to such settlement or elimination;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries may not
settle or eliminate such obligations in a manner that would result in any
material Liability to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates without Purchasers
prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, intercompany accounts to
the extent between and among any of the Transferred Entities only shall not be
required to have been eliminated at the Closing.

 



 

(b) Effective at the Closing, other than (i) this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, (ii) the Closing Intercompany Trade Accounts and (iii) the other
arrangements, understandings or Contracts listed in Section 5.10(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, all arrangements, understandings or Contracts,

to the extent such claim will not be validly settled prior to or at the
Closing, such claim shall be an Assumed Liability.

of any financial statements of KVP GmbH or BAH GmbH as of any date prior to
the Closing

 



     

 

 



 

Date, in each case on the grounds that the rights and obligations under the
applicable Domination Agreement related to any compensation of losses for the
current or any previous fiscal year have not been properly settled.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Insurance Matters_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that, except for insurance coverage provided under
a Business Contract, all insurance coverage for the Business, the Transferred
Entities, the Business Assets and the Assumed Liabilities under policies of
Seller Parent and the Retained Subsidiaries, including any captive insurance
program maintained by Seller Parent or its Retained Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Seller Parent Insurance Policies_ "), shall terminate as
of the Closing and, except as set forth in Section 5.12(b), following Closing
no claims may be brought against any Seller Parent Insurance Policy in
relation to the Business, the Transferred Entities, the Transferred Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities regardless of whether the events underlying such claim
arose prior to or after the Closing.

 



 

(b) If any of the Business, the Transferred Entities or the Business Assets
suffers a Loss after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and a claim for
such Loss may be made under a Seller Parent Insurance Policy prior to the
Closing, then Seller Parent shall make a claim against such Seller Parent
Insurance Policy in the manner and consistent with the past practices of
Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries in any event prior to the Closing Date. If
such a claim is made in respect of a Seller Parent Insurance Policy and not
recovered prior to the Closing, then Seller Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts after the Closing to recover proceeds for any such Loss under such
Seller Parent Insurance Policy, in each case, to the extent that the terms and
conditions of any such Seller Parent Insurance Policy so allow, and any such
proceeds recovered by Seller Parent after the Closing under this Section
5.12(b) shall be paid to Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ in no case
shall Seller Parent be required to threaten or commence litigation in respect
of any claim made pursuant to this Section 5.12(b).

 



 

Section 5.13 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing and except as (i) required by applicable Law or (ii)
as agreed in writing by Purchaser, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, treat as confidential and shall safeguard and Seller Parent
shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, disclose to any third
party (A) the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (B) any
confidential information included in the Business Intellectual Property or
other confidential information, knowledge or Data included in the Business
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, in each case to the extent related to the
Business, the Transferred Entities, the Business Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities and (C) any Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) disclosed by Purchaser to Seller Parent and its Representatives.
Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use the same degree
of care, to no less than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent the
unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge
and Data as Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries used with respect thereto prior
to the date of this Agreement.

party the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (provided that
such terms may be disclosed to any Debt Financing Source) or any information,
knowledge or Data included in (x) the Seller Leased Property or (y) any
information relating to the businesses of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries
other than the Business that becomes known to Purchaser as a result of or in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, except as otherwise agreed to
by Seller Parent in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Section 5.13(b) shall prevent the disclosure of any such information,
knowledge or Data to any Representatives of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to
whom such disclosure is necessary or desirable in the conduct of the Business
or the operation of the Business Assets if such Representatives are informed
by Purchaser of the confidential nature of such information and are directed
by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to comply with the provisions of this Section
5.13(b).

 



 

(c) At any time upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, in its sole
discretion, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall promptly, at the
option of the Receiving Party (which shall be promptly communicated in writing
to the Disclosing Party), destroy (and shall certify such destruction in
writing to the Disclosing Party by one of its Representatives) or return to
the Disclosing Party all written, electronic or other tangible confidential
information of the Disclosing Party described in this Section 5.13 and shall
not retain any copies of such confidential information. Notwithstanding such
destruction or return, all such confidential information which is oral and all
information embodied in such confidential information shall continue to be
held confidential pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.13. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the Receiving Partys legal department and its
Representatives may retain copies of any confidential information in
accordance with bona fide internal document retention policies and procedures
implemented by such Persons solely in order to comply with Law, regulation or
professional standards and (ii) the obligation to return or destroy
confidential information shall not cover information that is maintained on
routine computer system backup tapes, disks or other backup storage devices as
long as such backed-up information is not used, disclosed or otherwise
recovered from such back-up devices; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
confidential information so retained in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii)
shall continue, in each case, to be held confidential pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Purchaser and Seller Parent acknowledge that the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.13 shall not extend to information, knowledge and Data that (i)
the Party owing a duty of confidentiality can demonstrate is or becomes
publicly available through no act or omission of the Party owing a duty of

with or other obligations of secrecy to the other Party.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release and thereafter each
Party shall

 



     

 

 



 

consult with the other Party, and provide meaningful opportunity for review
and give due consideration to reasonable comment by the other Party, prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise making planned public statements with
respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions and prior to making
any filings with any third party or any Government Entity (including any
national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except (i) as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or the NYSE or (ii) any
consultation that would not be reasonably practicable as a result of
requirements of applicable Law. Each Party may make any public statements in
response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or analyst or investor conference calls, so long as such
statements are not inconsistent with previous statements made jointly by the
Parties.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Permits and Product Authorizations_.

 



 

(a) Within three (3) months of the date of this Agreement, Seller Parent shall
deliver to Purchaser a plan for separation, transfer and operation of the
Business immediately following the Closing (the " _Central Transfer Plan_ ").
The Central Transfer Plan shall include, with respect to each country in the
Territory, the information described on Annex 26 and shall specify, with
respect to each country in the Territory, whether the operating model for the
Business immediately following the Closing shall be (i) the Full Transfer
Model (a " _Full Transfer Country_ "), (ii) the Importer of Record Model (an "
_Importer of Record Country_ ") or (iii) the Interim Commercialization
Agreement Model (an " _Interim Commercialization Country_ "). The Central
Transfer Plan shall designate each country in the Territory as a Full Transfer
Country unless Seller Parent reasonably determines that (i) in such country
either (x) the transfer to Purchaser of the applicable Transferred Product
Authorizations (with "transfer" for these purposes meaning the approval of a
change in the holder of the applicable Transferred Product Authorizations (and
not, for the avoidance of doubt, changes to product labelling or artwork
unless required by applicable Law in connection with such change of holder) by
the applicable Government Entity and such approval having become effective
(for instance, by way of publication)) or (y) the transfer of any applicable
Permits or obtaining of any applicable Permits, would take longer than ninety
(90) days after Closing under applicable Law, or (ii) (A) Seller Parent and
its Subsidiaries cannot effect the transfer of the Transferred Assets in such
country at the Closing in accordance with applicable Law or (B) Purchaser or
its Affiliates, even if complying with the obligations set forth in Section
5.15(c), would not be capable of selling the Business Products in such country
in accordance with applicable Law immediately following the Closing (unless
any such restrictions under applicable Law are limited only to Permits and
Transferred Product Authorizations), in which case the Central Transfer Plan
shall designate such country as an Interim Commercialization Country. Seller
Parent shall provide to Purchaser upon request any information on which the
designation of a country as an Interim Commercialization Country or Importer
of Record Country is based. Purchaser may, within one (1) month of the
delivery of the Central Transfer Plan, propose a revision of any element of
the Central Transfer Plan with respect to any country, including a request to
remove any countries from the Territory. If Purchaser makes any requests for
revision, Seller Parent shall consider such proposed revision in good faith;

 



     

 

 



 

 _provided_ , that Seller Parent shall, in its reasonable discretion, have a
right to refuse to accept any such proposed revision with respect to the
Central Transfer Plan. At any time prior to the Closing, with reasonable prior
notice to Purchaser, Seller Parent may amend the Central Transfer Plan in any
manner it reasonably determines to be necessary for the continuity of the
Business following the Closing, subject to the right of Purchaser to request a
revision to the Central Transfer Plan as so amended in the same manner as
described in the previous sentences. Following the Closing, Seller Parent
shall cooperate with any reasonable requests of Purchaser with respect to
information on the implementation of the Central Transfer Plan.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after receiving the Central Transfer
Plan, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, apply for
any Permits (including Transferred Permits which are unable to be transferred
under applicable Law) required for the operation of the Business after the
Closing Date, in each case in the name of Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliate (or any other name desired by Purchaser) and in accordance with the
terms of the Central Transfer Plan, if applicable.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Transferred Product Authorizations to be
transferred to Purchaser in its, its Affiliates or its or their designees
name(s) and to obtain any related approvals for any changes to product
labelling or artwork as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date,
in each case in accordance with the Central Transfer Plan, if applicable. Any
and all fees, expenses (whether internal or external, and including personnel
expenses) and other costs associated with effectuating such transfers and
incurred by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall be borne by Purchaser,
its Affiliates or its or their designees and neither Seller Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall be responsible for the payment of such fees, expenses or
costs.

 



 

(d) In connection with the actions contemplated by Section 5.15(c), Seller
Parent shall, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, cooperate with
Purchaser, its Affiliates and its or their designees in seeking to have the
Transferred Product Authorizations and Transferred Permits transferred to
Purchasers, its Affiliates or its or their designees name in accordance
with Section 5.15(c) and in furtherance of the foregoing, Seller Parent and/or
the Retained Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to execute,
deliver and/or file any documents required to be executed, delivered and/or
filed by Seller Parent and/or the Retained Subsidiaries and provide to
Purchaser, its Affiliates and its or their designees any information or Data
necessary in order to effectuate the transfer of the Transferred Product
Authorizations and Transferred Permits. Any and all fees, expenses (whether
internal or external, and including personnel expenses) and other costs
associated with effectuating such transfers and incurred by Seller Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be borne by Seller Parent, its Subsidiaries or
its or their designees and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall
be responsible for the payment of such fees, expenses or costs.

 



 

(e) With respect to each Transferred Product Authorization and except as
otherwise provided in any Ancillary Agreement, until the earlier of (i) the
date upon which such Transferred Product Authorization is transferred to
Purchasers, its Affiliates

 



     

 

 



 

or its or their designees name or (ii) the date which is four (4) years
following the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause each of the
Retained Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to keep current and
in full force and effect, or to apply for or renew, any Transferred Product
Authorization; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller Parent nor any
Retained Subsidiary shall be required to initiate any portfolio optimization
activities or to initiate any studies (including any non-clinical, clinical or
stability studies) which were not ongoing as of the Closing Date unless such
studies are required under applicable Law to maintain any Transferred Product
Authorization or Transferred Permit; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, taking
into account that the relevant employees of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries
may be Transferred Employees as of or following Closing, reasonable best
efforts shall not include Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries hiring or re-
assigning any of their respective employees in connection with such
activities, whether prior to or following Closing. If any studies are required
under applicable Law to maintain any Transferred Product Authorization or
Transferred Permit, then Seller Parent shall inform Purchaser and Seller
Parent and Purchaser shall meet, confer and negotiate in good faith with
respect to whether Seller Parent shall initiate such studies, and Purchaser
shall reimburse Seller Parent and the Retained Subsidiaries for fifty percent
(50%) of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including any fees
payable to the relevant Government Entity) incurred by Seller Parent and the
Retained Subsidiaries in connection with such studies. Except as otherwise
provided in the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller Parent
and the Retained Subsidiaries for fifty percent (50%) of any and all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including any fees payable to the relevant
Government Entity) incurred by Seller Parent and the Retained Subsidiaries in
connection with its obligation to maintain Transferred Product Authorizations
pursuant to this Section 5.15(e).

 



 

(f) Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 5.15(e) or any Ancillary
Agreement, at and after the Closing, (i) Purchaser, its Affiliates or its or
their designees shall be responsible for the maintenance of all Transferred
Product Authorizations (including the generation of any new Product
Authorization Data, if applicable, and the determination of the regulatory
strategy) at its or their own expense and (ii) neither Seller Parent nor any
of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to support or maintain the
Transferred Product Authorizations, except that Seller Parent and its
Affiliates shall, for ten (10) years following the Closing Date, forward
promptly to Purchaser any written communications received from a Government
Entity with respect to the Transferred Product Authorizations and submit any
documents or communication with respect to a Transferred Product Authorization
to a Government Entity as reasonably requested by Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser shall reimburse Seller Parent and the Retained
Subsidiaries for fifty (50%) of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including
any fees payable to the relevant Government Entity) incurred by Seller Parent
and the Retained Subsidiaries in connection with such forwarding of
communications or submission of documents or communication.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Mail and Other Communications_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries may receive
mail, packages and other communications (including electronic communications)

 



     

 

 



 

properly belonging to Purchaser and its Affiliates. Accordingly, at all times
following the Closing, Purchaser authorizes Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries
to receive and open all mail, packages and other communications received by it
and not clearly intended for Purchaser or its Affiliates or any of Purchasers
or its Affiliates officers or directors, and to retain the same to the extent
that they are not related to the Business, the Transferred Entities, the
Business Assets or the Assumed Liabilities or, to the extent they are related
to the Business, the Transferred Entities, the Business Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, Seller Parent shall promptly after becoming aware thereof refer,
forward or otherwise deliver such mail, packages or other communications (or,
in case the same relate to both the Business, the Transferred Entities, the
Business Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and any retained businesses or
operations of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Excluded Asset,
copies thereof) to Purchaser. The provisions of this Section 5.16 are not
intended to, and shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by
Purchaser or its Affiliates to permit Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to accept service of process on its behalf, and Seller Parent is not and shall
not be deemed to be the agent of Purchaser for service of process purposes.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries may receive mail,
packages and other communications (including electronic communications)
properly belonging to Seller Parent and its Affiliates. Accordingly, at all
times following the Closing, Seller Parent authorizes Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries to receive and open all mail, packages and other communications

the Assumed Liabilities and any retained Businesses or operations of Seller
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Excluded Assets, copies thereof) to
Seller Parent. The provisions of this Section 5.16 are not intended to, and

an agreement to acquire);

 



 

(iii) making passive financial investments or similar passive financial
participation in investment funds that in turn may invest in Persons that may,
from time to time, engage in a Competing Business if such investment or
participation does not provide Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries with
representation on the governing body of any such investment fund or any such
Person; _provided_ that in no event will participation in an advisory group of
an investment fund be considered representation on the governing body of such
investment fund; and

 



 

(iv) exercising its rights or complying with its obligations under

 



     

 

 



 

this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

without regard to invalid portions and such amendment shall apply only with
respect to the operation of this Section 5.18 in the particular jurisdiction
in which such adjudication is made.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Wrong Pockets_. In the event that following the Closing either
Seller Parent or Purchaser becomes aware that (a) Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities) do not have record or beneficial

Assumed Liability has not been assumed by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates
at the Closing, or (b) record or beneficial ownership or possession of any
asset that is not a Business Asset is in the possession of a Transferred
Entity or has been sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered by
Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates at the
Closing, or that any Excluded Liability has been erroneously assumed by
Purchaser at the Closing, then it shall promptly notify the other Party, and
the Parties shall thereafter cooperate to, as soon as reasonably practicable,

or as required pursuant to Form S-3 in connection with an offering of

correctness and completeness of the information provided to the Business
Employees and Employee Representative Bodies by Seller Parent and its
Subsidiaries relating to Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries as well as the
Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall
comply with the obligations set forth in Annex 10.

 



      

 

 



 

Section 6.2 _Continuation of Employment_.

 



 

(a) The Parties intend that there shall be continuity of employment with
respect to all Business Employees as follows (and intend that this Section 6.2
be interpreted and administered in accordance with applicable Law, in a manner
to effect such intent): (i) the Transferred Entity Employees shall continue to
be employed by the Transferred Entities on and following the Closing; (ii)
where applicable Law provides for an automatic transfer of employees upon the
transfer of a business or part of a business as a going concern, the
employment of the Business Employees shall not be terminated upon the Closing
and the rights, powers, duties, Liabilities and obligations of Seller Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to or in respect of such Business Employees in
respect of any contract of employment with such Business Employees in force
immediately before the Closing shall be transferred to Purchaser and/or one of
its Affiliates in accordance with applicable Law (including the Transfer of
Undertakings); and (iii) where applicable Law does not provide for the
automatic transfer of employees upon the transfer of a business or part of a
business as a going concern (or in any jurisdiction where applicable Law
provides for the automatic transfer of employees upon the transfer of a
business or part of a business as a going concern but for any reason any
Business Employee does not transfer by operation of Law), Purchaser shall no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date offer employment to each
such Business Employee commencing on the Closing Date on the Current
Employment Terms. The Parties may agree, on a country-by-country basis, to
replace the offers of employment provided for in clause (iii) above by tri-
partite transfer agreements to be signed by Seller Parent or the applicable
Subsidiary of Seller Parent currently employing the relevant Business
Employee, Purchaser and the Business Employee to effectuate the transfer of
the relevant Business Employee to Purchaser pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 6.2(a), and Purchaser and Seller Parent
shall cooperate in good faith in this regard.

 



 

(b) Each Business Employee (i) who accepts an offer of employment with
Purchaser, (ii) who is a Transferred Entity Employee, (iii) whose employment
automatically transfers to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under applicable
Law or (iv) who enters into a tri-partite transfer agreement, in each case in
accordance with this Section 6.2, shall be a " _Transferred Employee_ " for
purposes of this Agreement upon the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law or
Labor Obligation; _provided_ that no Business Employee shall be a Transferred
Employee under clause (ii) above where such Business Employee refuses or
objects to the transfer to Purchaser in accordance with applicable Law or
Labor Obligation. The employment of each Transferred Employee shall be deemed
to transfer from Seller Parent to Purchaser as of 11:59 p.m. on the date which
is one (1) day prior to the Closing Date in the jurisdiction in which such
employee is employed.

 



 

(c) Seller Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to jointly
notify the Business Employees who automatically transfer to Purchaser and/or
one of its Affiliates in accordance with Section 6.2(a)(ii) about their
transfer to Purchaser and/or one of its Affiliates at a time jointly
determined by Seller Parent and Purchaser after the date hereof (and in any
event more than one month before the Closing Date), if and to the

 



     

 

 



 

extent that such notification is required by applicable Law and Labor
Obligations, including with respect to the exchange of information required
for the notification.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Terms and Conditions of Employment_.

 



 

(a) Starting at the time an employee becomes a Transferred Employee and ending
on the date that is (i) three (3) years following the Closing Date, for each
Transferred Employee employed in Germany, and (ii) one (1) year following the
Closing Date, for each Transferred Employee employed outside of Germany, or in
each case any longer period as required under applicable Law, Labor Obligation
or Bayer Restructuring Principles (which principles restrict unilateral
alteration of the Current Employment Terms until the later of five (5) years
following the Closing Date and December 30, 2025), such Transferred Employee
shall be employed by Purchaser on terms that are substantially similar to and
no less favorable than the Current Employment Terms and participate in
employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements
(including pension, retirement, health, welfare, fringe and other employee
benefits) of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Plans_ ") that are substantially
similar to and no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements of Seller Parent or the applicable Subsidiary
of Seller Parent in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect
to such Transferred Employee, and shall be offered any other additional terms
and conditions of employment by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates required by
applicable Law, Labor Obligation or Bayer Restructuring Principles; _provided_
, _however_ , that with respect to Temporary Employees, the requirements of
this sentence shall only apply for the remainder of such Temporary Employees
existing contract term unless applicable Law requires otherwise.

 



 

(b) Starting on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is (x) three (3)
years following the Closing Date, for each Transferred Employee employed in
Germany, and (y) one (1) year following the Closing Date, for each Transferred
Employee employed outside of Germany, or in each case any longer period as
required under applicable Law, Labor Obligation or Bayer Restructuring
Principles, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not (i) terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee or (ii) serve a formal notice of
involuntary termination on any Transferred Employee triggering the start of
the applicable notice period, in each case, other than for cause in accordance
with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements of this
sentence shall not apply to Temporary Employees unless required by applicable
Law; and _provided further_ that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict
Purchaser from approaching any Transferred Employee for the purpose of
entering (or from actually entering) into a voluntary agreement with any
Transferred Employee providing for the termination of employment of such
Transferred Employee at any time following the Closing Date, subject to
Section 2.16 of this Agreement, applicable Law or Labor Obligation.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall assume all Liabilities to provide any severance payments
required to be paid, including cash severance, benefits, which become payable
due to the termination of the employment relationship or other severance
amounts, under any applicable Law, Labor Obligation or Benefit Plan (including
any employment agreement or offer letter) to (i) any Business Employee who is
not offered employment

 



     

 

 



 

by Purchaser and/or one of its Affiliates in compliance with Section 6.2, (ii)
any Business Employee who rejects the offer of employment made by Purchaser
and/or one of its Affiliates, who rejects the transfer of employment to
Purchaser and/or one of its Affiliates, or who terminates his or her
employment so as not to transfer to Purchaser and/or one of its Affiliates,
and (iii) any Business Employee who is entitled to such termination-related
payments under applicable Law or Labor Obligation in connection with the
Transaction (x) as a result of a termination of employment in connection with
the Transaction or (y) due to Purchasers noncompliance with Section 6.2 or
Section 6.3(a) or violation of any Law, Labor Obligation or other agreement
with respect to any Business Employee. In the event that Purchaser and/or one
of its Affiliates enters into a settlement or release agreement with any
Transferred Employee following the Closing in relation to such Transferred
Employees termination of employment, such agreement shall provide that the
Seller Indemnified Parties are released from any applicable claims to the same
extent as Purchaser.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Failure to Transfer/Unintended Employee Transfers_.

 



 

(a) If any contract of employment of any Business Employee who was intended to
be a Transferred Employee is, within thirty (30) Business Days after the
Closing Date, found to have wrongfully continued with Seller Parent or its
Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Entity Employees) after such Business
Employees intended transfer date, the Parties agree that: (i) Purchaser or
its Affiliates, within fourteen (14) days of discovering such a finding, shall
make to that Business Employee an offer in writing to employ him or her under
a new contract of employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates to take effect
as soon as reasonably permissible under applicable Law and Labor Obligations;
and (ii) upon the offer of employment being made by Purchaser or its
Affiliates, or on the expiry of the fourteen (14)-day period from the date of
discovery of such a finding, Seller Parent or its Affiliates shall give any
notice of termination required by contract, applicable Law or Labor Obligation
to the applicable Business Employee, subject to any waiver of such notice
agreed with such Business Employee, and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for any payments relating to the
termination of employment, including severance, benefits or other amounts due
under any applicable Law, Labor Obligation, or contractual obligation, or
under any plan, policy, practice or agreement of Seller Parent or its
Affiliates incurred by them as a result of the termination of employment of
such Business Employee.

 



 

(b) If any contract of employment of any employee (other than a Business
Employee) who at any time is, was or may become employed or otherwise engaged
by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates and whose employment is, within
thirty (30) Business Days after the Closing Date, found to have wrongfully
transferred to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Entity Employees) in connection with the Transactions, the Parties agree that:
(i) Seller Parent or its Affiliates, within fourteen (14) days of discovering
such a finding, shall make to that person an offer in writing to employ him or
her under a new contract of employment with Seller Parent or its Affiliates to
take effect as soon as permissible under applicable Law and Labor Obligations;
and (ii) upon the offer of employment being made by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates, or on the expiry of the fourteen (14)-day period from the date of
discovery of

 



     

 

 



 

such a finding, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall give any notice of
termination required by contract, applicable Law or Labor Obligation to the
applicable employee, subject to any waiver of such notice agreed with such
employee and Seller Parent and its Affiliates shall indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for any payments relating to the termination of
employment, including severance, benefits or other amounts due under any
applicable Law, Labor Obligation or contractual obligation, or under any plan,
policy, practice or agreement of Seller Parent or its Affiliates incurred by
Purchaser or its Affiliates as a result of the termination of employment of
any such employee.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Assumed Employee Liabilities_. Purchaser shall, as of the Closing
Date, assume all Liabilities of or in relation to the Transferred Entity
Benefit Plans and in addition shall assume all Liabilities of or in relation
to each Transferred Employee, in both instances whether relating to periods
prior to or after the time of transfer of employment of any Transferred
Employee (the " _Assumed Employee Liabilities_ "); _provided_ that Seller
Parent shall retain responsibility for any Liabilities:

 



 

(a) solely to the extent incurred under plans that are not Transferred Entity
Benefit Plans, under medical, life insurance, long-term disability and other
welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Transferred Employee with respect
to claims incurred and raised by such Transferred Employee or his or her
covered dependents prior to the Closing Date except to the extent that such
Liabilities are reflected in the Closing Date Statement;

 



 

(b) for refunds of expenses raised by Transferred Employees prior to the
Closing Date, only if not payable by a Transferred Entity and not reflected in
the Closing Date Statement;

 



 

(c) for amounts accrued under bonus programs to each Transferred Employee in
respect of the period prior to and including the date that is one (1) day
prior to the Closing Date, determined and paid by Seller Parent in a manner
consistent with past practice with the exception that Transferred Employees
who are employed by Purchaser or an Affiliate on the date of payment of such
bonus amounts by Seller Parent shall be eligible to receive their accrued
bonus amounts, pro-rated to the Closing Date, on such payment date;

 



 

(d) for Change of Control and Retention Payments;

 



 

(e) that are Retained Benefit Plan Liabilities; or

 



 

(f) for any payments of employee inventor compensation in respect of Business
Patents under the German Employee Inventions Act (
_Arbeitnehmererfindungengesetz_ \- _ArbNErfG_ ) or any similar applicable Laws
of any other jurisdiction that were required to be made prior to the Closing
Date.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Accrued Vacation_. Without limiting Section 6.5, Purchaser shall
assume and honor all accrued and earned vacation time (including flexible time
off, paid time off, sick pay and any similar entitlements) that remains unused
as of the Closing Date (" _Accrued Vacation_ "), and (i) permit each
Transferred Employee to use her

 



     

 

 



 

or his Accrued Vacation on terms no less favorable than in effect for such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) subject to the
consent of such Transferred Employee and applicable Law, compensate such
Transferred Employee in cash for all or part of such Accrued Vacation.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Service Credit_. Purchaser shall recognize each Transferred
Employees seniority date with Seller Parent or the applicable Subsidiary of
Seller Parent (or their predecessors) under its employee benefit programs
(where such seniority date is relevant) consistent with Purchasers treatment
of employees generally. For all purposes under Purchaser Plans (including
Purchaser severance plans) providing benefits to any Transferred Employee on
and after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with Seller Parent or the
applicable Subsidiary of Seller Parent (or their predecessors) to the same
extent that such Transferred Employee was entitled to credit for such service
under any similar Benefit Plan of Seller Parent or the applicable Subsidiary
of Seller Parent in which such Transferred Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall cause each
Transferred Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage under such
New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under an Old Plan, and for purposes
of each New Plan providing medical, dental, disability, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any such Transferred Employee, any evidence of insurability
requirements, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Transferred Employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable
or waived under the comparable Old Plan. Purchaser shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred and paid by any Transferred Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Transferred Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Transfer to Purchaser Plans_. Except as required by applicable
Law, as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall cease to accrue
further benefits under the Benefit Plans (excluding Transferred Entity Benefit
Plans) and shall commence participation in Purchaser Plans. To the extent
applicable for Transferred Employees in the United States, Purchaser shall
take all steps necessary to permit each such Transferred Employee who has
received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of
the Code) from Seller Parents 401(k) Plan, if any, to roll such eligible
rollover distribution, including any associated loans, as part of any lump sum
distribution to the extent permitted by Seller Parents 401(k) Plan into an
account under Purchasers 401(k) Plan. In addition, Purchaser shall take
lawful actions to cause one or more analogous Purchaser Plans to accept the
enrollment of any Transferred Employees employed outside of the United States
who participated in any Benefit Plan

 



     

 

 



 

that is a defined contribution pension plan (other than Seller Parents 401(k)
Plan) immediately prior to the Closing Date, and, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law or Labor Obligation, Purchaser shall
cause to be transferred from each such plan the Liabilities, and as
applicable, the assets, for the account balances of such Transferred
Employees.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Pension Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall comply with the obligations relating to the Pension
Arrangements set forth in Annex 11 and Annex 12.

 



 

(b) Seller Parent undertakes to update the lists of plan documents relating to
each Transferred Defined Benefit Pension Plan and Other Long-Term Employee
Benefit Plan in Part A of Annex 11 such that such lists shall be complete and
correct at the Closing. It is the joint understanding of the Parties that at
the Closing, Part A of Annex 11 shall include complete lists of all plan
documents relating to Transferred Defined Benefit Pension Plan as of Closing.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Additional Business Employees_. Without limiting any obligation
of Seller Parent under this Article VI, from the date of this Agreement until
the Closing, Seller Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide
Purchaser access to, and to enable Purchaser to make offers of employment to,
any additional employees of Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries which Purchaser
and Seller Parent have mutually agreed to identify (and once identified, such
additional employees shall be deemed "Business Employees" for all purposes
hereunder).

 



 

Section 6.11 _Transfer of Leased Employee Vehicles_.

 



 

(a) Within thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement, Seller
Parent shall deliver to Purchaser a list of each vehicle that is leased by
Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries and is used by a Business Employee as of
the date of this Agreement (the " _Employee Vehicles_ "), including the terms
of the relevant leases (the " _Employee Vehicle Leases_ ").

 



 

(b) No Employee Vehicle Lease shall be deemed a Transferred Contract.
Purchaser shall have the option to make use of the Employee Vehicles as of and
following the Closing by (i) seeking to transfer the Employee Vehicle Leases
from Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries to Purchaser or (ii) establishing in
Purchasers name at or prior to the Closing new leases between Purchaser and
the applicable lessor in respect of any Employee Vehicle. Purchaser shall
inform Seller Parent whether Purchaser intends to make use of the Employee
Vehicles as described in the previous sentence, and to the extent necessary,
Seller Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Purchaser in
transferring the Employee Vehicle Leases or establishing such new leases and
transferring and delivering any relevant Employee Vehicles to Purchaser
subject to such transferred Employee Vehicle Leases or new leases; _provided_
that Seller Parent shall not be required to retain any Liability or make any
payments under any transferred Employee

 



     

 

 



 

Vehicle Leases or in respect of any transferred Employee Vehicle after the
Closing or be directly involved in the negotiations with the respective
lessor.

 



 

Section 6.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Subject to Section 11.3, nothing
in this Article VI or any other provision of this Agreement, whether express
or implied, is intended to, or shall: (i) constitute the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA
or applicable Law or otherwise be treated as an amendment or modification of
any Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement; (ii) limit
the right of Seller Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan, Purchaser Plan or other
benefit plan, agreement or arrangement; or (iii) create any third-party
beneficiary or other right (x) in any Person, including any current or former
employee of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any participant in any
Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement (or any dependent
or beneficiary thereof) or (y) to employment or continued employment for any
period of time or particular term or condition of employment.

 



 

 _ARTICLE VII_

 



 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 



 

Section 7.1 _Liability and Indemnification for Taxes by Seller Parent_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing until the expiration of the applicable Seller Tax
Indemnification Period (as defined below), Seller Parent shall (or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of (i) all Excluded Taxes and
(ii) to the extent attributable or related to Excluded Taxes, all reasonable,
out-of-pocket costs for professional, legal and accounting services in each
case of (i) and (ii) suffered or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Transferred Entity) (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, out-of-pocket costs for professional,
legal and accounting services in relation to a Pre-Closing Separate Return
that is prepared by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.8) (such indemnification
obligation, the " _Tax Indemnity_ "),

 



 

(i) except to the extent the respective Excluded Taxes have been paid or
otherwise settled prior to or on the Closing Date, _provided_ that any payment
or settlement of Excluded Taxes shall be treated as paid or otherwise settled
if and only if such payment or settlement relieves the Purchaser and its
Affiliates of Liability from such Excluded Taxes;

 



 

(ii) except to the extent the respective Excluded Taxes relate to income of
the Transferred Entities that can be sheltered by Tax loss carry backs or Tax
loss carry forwards that are or were available until the Closing Date
(including as a result of a subsequent Tax Contest) unless and to the extent
that relevant losses are incurred or suffered by the Transferred Entities
after the Closing Date;

 



     

 

 



 

(iii) only if and to the extent the respective Excluded Taxes do not arise or
are not increased as a result of any action contemplated by Section 7.2(c);

 



 

(iv) only if and to the extent the respective Excluded Taxes are not the
result of any restructuring, reorganization or other similar measures
initiated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any such
restructuring, reorganization or other similar measure initiated by a
Transferred Entity after the Closing), and their respective directors,
officers, shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,
Representatives and employees, that is effective for (or during) the Pre-
Closing Period, including, but not limited to, a change of methods of Tax
accounting or of transfer pricing or an amendment of Tax Returns for the Pre-
Closing Period unless such measure is required by mandatory law,
administrative guidance, a final determination by a Government Entity or
requested or approved by Seller Parent in writing (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that with respect
to the non-compliance with statutory holding periods, preferential Tax regimes
or binding Tax rulings, this Section 7.1(a)(iv) shall only apply if and to the
extent they have been disclosed in Section 7.1(a)(iv) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule; _and provided_ , _further_ , that this Section 7.1(a)(iv) shall not
apply to any change of the transfer prices or the transfer pricing model of
any Transferred Entity with effect for any taxable period after the Closing
Date if such change is, to Purchasers knowledge, in compliance with
applicable Law;

 



 

(v) only if and to the extent the respective Excluded Taxes are not the result
of any transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside
the Ordinary Course (other than as explicitly contemplated by this Agreement);

 



 

(vi) except to the extent the respective Excluded Taxes are subject to a
statutory or contractual claim for indemnification, compensation or recourse
of any Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any other Affiliate of Purchaser
against a third Person which is enforceable and fully recoverable and has not
increased the Transaction Consideration, unless and to the extent the
Purchaser or any of the Transferred Entities has offered the assignment of the
relevant claim to Seller Parent;

 



 

(vii) except to the extent the respective Excluded Taxes were indemnified or
compensated under the Local Agreements; or

 



 

(viii) except to the extent Purchaser has, in respect of the respective
Excluded Tax, breached any of the obligations under Section 7.6, Section 7.7,
Section 7.8, Section 7.9 and Section 7.10 of this Agreement and Seller
Parents ability to mitigate the respective Excluded Tax was materially
prejudiced by such breach. There is a rebuttable presumption ( _widerlegbare
Vermutung_ ) that Seller Parents ability was materially prejudiced if one of
the following cases is present: (w) a Pre-Closing Separate Return was filed in
breach

 



     

 

 



 

of Purchasers obligations pursuant to Section 7.8(a) or Section 7.8(b), (x)
an amended Tax Return was filed or a retroactive election was made in breach
of Purchasers obligations pursuant to Section 7.9; (y) neither Seller Parent
nor any of its Affiliates was provided with copies of any Tax assessments in
relation to Excluded Taxes in such a timely manner that Seller Parent had
reasonably sufficient time to consider the merits of the case and to request
the filing of a legal remedy before the expiry of the applicable deadline
(unless the remedy has been timely filed nevertheless); or (z) a legal remedy
was not filed against any Tax assessment in breach of Purchasers obligations
pursuant to Section 7.10(c).

 



 

Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the indemnity provided under this Section
7.1(a) shall be due: (i) in the case of a claim made in respect of a
Transferred Asset, to the Purchaser Indemnified Party that acquired such
Transferred Asset pursuant to this Agreement and paid the respective part of
the Transaction Consideration and (ii) in the case of a claim made in respect
of a Transferred Entity, to the Purchaser Indemnified Party that acquired such
Transferred Entity pursuant to this Agreement and paid the respective part of
the Transaction Consideration (in each of (i) and (ii), the " _Purchaser Tax
Indemnitee_ "), and any corresponding tax indemnity in a Local Agreement shall
reflect the same principle. If and to the extent any payment due to a
Purchaser Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7.1(a) (after the application of
the remainder of this Section 7.1) is subject to Tax in the hands of such
Purchaser Tax Indemnitee, the payment due to such Purchaser Tax Indemnitee
under this Section 7.1(a) shall be increased by such sum as will, after taking
into account the relevant Tax payable, leave such Purchaser Tax Indemnitee
with the same amount as such Purchaser Tax Indemnitee would have been entitled
to receive had such payment not been subject to Tax in the hands of such
Purchaser Tax Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Indemnity
shall only apply if and to the extent that the aggregate amount of Excluded
Taxes, after application of the exclusions set forth in Section
7.1(a)(i)-(viii), exceeds the aggregate amount of Tax liabilities, Tax
accruals and/or Taxes that are part of other liabilities or other accruals as
shown or provided for in the Closing Date Statement and that have reduced the
Transaction Consideration as part of the Closing Net Tax Position. In
addition, the Tax Indemnity shall only apply if and to the extent that the
Purchaser has not been previously compensated for the same Excluded Taxes
under Section 9.8(c).

 



 

(b) In relation to Tax Benefits, the following provisions shall apply:

 



 

(i) Purchaser agrees, as long as there are German Tax Audit LCFs (as defined
below) remaining, not to take the actions listed on Annex 28 without the
consent of Seller Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event Purchaser takes one of the actions
listed on Annex 28 without the consent of Seller Parent and such action
reduces or eliminates the amount of German Tax Audit LCFs remaining, the
amount of any reduced or eliminated German Tax Audit LCFs shall be treated as
if they remained for purposes of the calculation set forth in Section
7.1(b)(ii) by way of shadow Tax accounting.

 



 

(ii) If and to the extent any Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any Affiliate
of Purchaser is entitled to any Tax Benefit in or for periods beginning after

 



     

 

 



 

the Closing Date arising out of circumstances before the Closing Date which
lead to a payment obligation of Seller Parent under the Tax Indemnity, which
is due and payable, Purchaser shall pay to Seller Parent the amount of such
Tax Benefit actually realized in cash in any taxable period after the Closing
Date to be determined on a with and without basis, unless and to the extent
such Tax Benefit has already reduced a claim against Seller Parent pursuant to
Section 9.8(c); _provided_ that any Tax Benefit other than a German Tax Audit
LCF shall lead to a payment of Purchaser to Seller Parent only if and to the
extent it has been realized in cash at the latest until (and including) the
sixth (6th) taxable year following the taxable year of the incurrence of the
underlying Loss that gave rise to the Tax Indemnity, as determined on a with
and without basis, unless and to the extent such Tax Benefit has already
reduced a claim against Seller Parent pursuant to Section 9.8(c);

 



 

(iii) If, after Purchaser has made a payment to Seller Parent under this
Section 7.1(b), the relevant Tax Benefit is subsequently reduced or disallowed
as a consequence of an amendment or a rescission of the relevant Tax
assessment or a mandatory prepayment of Taxes, Seller Parent shall promptly
(but no later than five (5) days following notice of such reduction or
disallowance being provided to Seller Parent) refund to the Purchaser the
amount of such reduced or disallowed Tax Benefits.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller Parents payment claims pursuant to
this Section 7.1(b) shall not be duplicative of any amounts that are shown or
provided for in the Closing Date Statement and that have increased the
Transaction Consideration.

 



 

(c) Seller Parent shall not be liable to Purchaser for any Excluded Tax unless
and until the amount of such Excluded Tax exceeds ten thousand Dollars
($10,000) (the _"Excluded Tax Threshold_ "); provided, that once such Excluded
Tax exceeds the Excluded Tax Threshold, Seller Parent shall be liable to
Purchaser for the entire amount of all Excluded Taxes ( _Freigrenze_ ). For
the purposes of this Section 7.1(c), an Excluded Tax shall be equal to the
amount shown as payable on an individual Tax assessment (as the case may be,
per individual Tax period and per individual type of Tax, in each case
including interest, solidarity surcharge and other amounts thereon),
_provided_ , however, if there is more than one Excluded Tax, such Excluded
Taxes shall be aggregated and treated as one individual claim for purposes of
the foregoing where a series of such Excluded Taxes arises out of the same or
a similar event, cause or circumstance (e.g., claims that are based on the
same trade Tax measuring assessment ( _Gewerbesteuermessbescheid_ ) or the
same change in the Tax treatment for multiple business transactions ( _Gesch
aftsvorfalle_) by a Government Entity, such as a change in the wage tax
treatment for multiple employees or a change in the tax accounting treatment
of multiple assets of the same kind).

 



 

(d) In the event that Purchaser becomes aware of any demand, claim or notice
of the commencement of any Tax Contest received by the Purchaser from any
Government Entity or any other Person with respect to any Excluded Taxes for
which Seller Parent may have any indemnification obligation under Section
7.1(a), Purchaser shall provide a claim notice (such claim notice, a "
_Purchaser Tax Claim Notice_ ") to

 



      

 

 



 

Seller Parent as soon as practicable but in no event later than fifteen (15)
Business Days thereafter; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such
notice will not affect Purchasers rights to indemnification under Section
7.1(a), except to the extent that Seller Parent is actually prejudiced
thereby. Such Purchaser Tax Claim Notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the
respective Tax assessment notice and any other writing communication by a
Government Entity in relation to the respective Excluded Tax and shall
describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances reasonably necessary
to understand and evaluate the respective claim.

 



 

(e) A claim of Purchaser against Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(a)
shall become due and payable on the date which is the later of (i) ten (10)
Business Days after receipt by Seller Parent of the applicable Purchaser Tax
Claim Notice and (ii) the date which is five (5) Business Days prior to the
date the relevant Excluded Tax is due for payment to the applicable Government
Entity; _provided_ that a claim which relates to costs for services and
Excluded Taxes for a Straddle Period becomes due and payable ten (10) Business
Days after receipt by Seller Parent of such Purchaser Tax Claim Notice. At
Seller Parents written request, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entities)
to, apply for a suspension of the enforcement or any comparable measure and
any costs incurred in this context (including suspension interest and any
collateral potentially requested by a Government Entity) shall be borne by
Seller Parent.

 



 

(f) Purchaser shall notify Seller Parent without undue delay of any payment
obligation pursuant to Section 7.1(b). A claim of Seller Parent against
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall become due and payable ten (10)
Business Days after the Tax Benefit was realized in cash by any Transferred
Entity, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser. A Tax Benefit is actually
realized in cash, to be determined on a with and without basis, if and to the
extent: (x) the Tax assessments for the relevant taxable period have been
issued and, according to such Tax assessments, the Tax which is actually
payable by any Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser
falls short of the Tax which would have been payable without the Tax Benefit,
(y) the amount of any mandatory prepayment of Tax which is actually payable by
any Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser falls short of
the Tax which would have been payable without the Tax Benefit (z) any
Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser receives a refund
of a Tax which is caused by the Tax Benefit, it being understood that the same
Tax Benefit can be realized under (x), (y) and (z) only once.

 



 

(g) Purchasers claims pursuant to Section 7.1(a) and all other covenants and
agreements of Seller Parent contained in this Article VII (other than claims
pursuant to Section 7.4(a), which are governed by Section 7.4(d)), Section
5.26 and Section 5.29 shall survive the Closing until the later of (i) ninety
(90) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(taking into account any extension, suspension, tolling or interruption of the
statute of limitation) for the Excluded Taxes to be indemnified under this
Article VII and (ii) six (6) months after the Tax assessment regarding the
Excluded Taxes to be indemnified under this Section 7.1 becomes final and
binding (the period through the expiration date being referred to as the "
_Seller Tax_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Indemnification Period_ "); and Purchasers refund claims pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iv) shall survive the Closing until the later of (y) ninety
(90) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(taking into account any extension, suspension, tolling or interruption of the
statute of limitation) for the Tax assessments to which the Tax Benefit
relates from which the refund claim pursuant to Section 7.1(b) arises and (z)
six (6) months after the Tax assessment regarding the Tax Benefit relates from
which the refund claim pursuant to Section 7.1(b) arises becomes final and
binding; _provided_ that in the event a Purchaser Tax Claim Notice has been
received by Seller Parent within such period the covenants and agreements that
are the subject of such Purchaser Tax Claim Notice (and such claim itself)
shall survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is
finally resolved.

 



 

(h) Seller Parents claims pursuant to Section 7.1(b) shall survive the
Closing until ninety (90) days following the receipt of Purchasers
notification pursuant to Section 7.1(e); _provided_ that in the event a claim
notice has been received by Purchaser within such period, the covenants and
agreements that are the subject of such claim notice (and such claim itself)
shall survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is
finally resolved.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Liability and Indemnification for Taxes by Purchaser_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing until the expiration of the applicable Purchaser Tax
Indemnification Period, Purchaser shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from,
against and in respect of all Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes, refunds of a
Tax Benefit or other Tax-related items in respect of which Purchaser has a
claim against Seller Parent under this Article VII) imposed or assessed
against or payable by any Seller Indemnified Parties which relate to the
Transferred Entities or the Transferred Assets, if and to the extent that such
Taxes have not been indemnified or compensated under a Local Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnity provided in this Section 7.2(a)
shall (i) not be duplicative of any amounts shown or provided for in the
Closing Date Statement and that have increased the Transaction Consideration
and (ii) not include indemnification for the forfeiture or reduction of any
Tax losses or Tax loss carryforwards of the Transferred Entities (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, indemnification by Purchaser under Section 7.15).
Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the indemnity provided under this Section
7.2(a) shall be due: (i) in the case of a claim made in respect of Transferred
Asset, to the Seller Indemnified Party that transferred such Transferred Asset
pursuant to this Agreement and received the respective part of the Transaction
Consideration and (ii) in the case of a claim made in respect of a Transferred
Entity, to the Seller Indemnified Party that transferred such Transferred
Entity pursuant to this Agreement and received the respective part of the
Transaction Consideration (in each of (i) and (ii), the " _Seller Tax
Indemnitee_ "), and any corresponding tax indemnity in a Local Agreement shall
reflect the same principle. If and to the extent any payment due to a Seller
Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7.2(a) (after the application of the
remainder of this Section 7.2) is subject to Tax in the hands of such Seller
Tax Indemnitee, the payment due to such Seller Tax Indemnitee under this
Section 7.2(a) shall be increased by such sum as will, after taking into
account the

 



     

 

 



 

relevant Tax payable, leave such Seller Tax Indemnitee with the same amount as
such Seller Tax Indemnitee would have been entitled to receive had such
payment not been subject to Tax in the hands of such Seller Tax Indemnitee.

 



 

(b) In the event that Seller Parent becomes aware of any demand, claim or
notice of the commencement of any Tax Contest received by Seller Parent from
any Government Entity or any other Person with respect to any Taxes for which
Purchaser may have any indemnification obligation under this Section 7.2,
Seller Parent shall provide a claim notice (such claim notice, a " _Seller
Parent Tax Claim Notice_ ") to Purchaser as soon as practicable but in no
event later than fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter; _provided_ , _however_
, that a failure to give such notice will not affect Seller Parents rights to
indemnification under this Section 7.2, except to the extent that Purchaser is
actually prejudiced thereby. Such Seller Parent Tax Claim Notice shall be
accompanied by a copy of the respective Tax assessment notice and any other
writing communication by a Government Entity in relation to the respective Tax
and shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances reasonably
necessary to understand and evaluate the respective claim. Purchaser shall
have with respect to the respective Tax the information, cooperation and
instruction rights pursuant to Section 7.10 applied _mutatis mutandis_. A
claim of Seller Parent against Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall
become due and payable on the date which is the later of (i) ten (10) Business
Days after receipt by Purchaser of the applicable Seller Parent Tax Claim
Notice and (ii) the date which is five (5) Business Days prior to the date the
relevant Tax is due for payment to the applicable Government Entity. At
Purchasers written request, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, apply for a suspension of the enforcement or any comparable
measure and any costs incurred in this context (including suspension interest
and any collateral potentially requested by a Government Entity) shall be
borne by Purchaser.

 



 

(c) Unless required by applicable law, Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit any Affiliate to, undertake any transactions, or otherwise take any
action or measure, after the Closing Date (including any change in the
accounting or taxation principles or practices of the Transferred Entities,
any change in the exercise of any Tax election right, or the approval or
implementation of any reorganization measure) that would be effective for (or
during) the Pre-Closing Period and could reasonably be expected to increase
the Tax liability or reduce any Tax attribute (including any Tax loss carry
forward) of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates, including but not limited
to a reduction in Tax Benefits of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates or
increase any payment obligation by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliate in
relation to Taxes. This Section 7.2(c) shall not apply to any change of the
transfer prices or the transfer pricing model of any Transferred Entity with
effect for any taxable period after the Closing Date, including any amendment
to or termination of the KVP Agreement, if such change is, to Purchasers
knowledge, in compliance with applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The provisions of Section 7.1(c) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to claims
for indemnification brought pursuant to this Section 7.2.

 



 

(e) All covenants and agreements of Purchaser contained in this

 



     

 

 



 

Article VII, other than claims under Section 7.1(b), which are governed by
Section 7.1(h), and claims pursuant to Section 7.4(a), which are governed by
Section 7.4(d), shall survive the Closing until the later of (i) ninety (90)
days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking
into account any extension, suspension, tolling or interruption of the statute
of limitation) for the Taxes to be indemnified under this Section 7.2 and (ii)
six (6) months after the Tax assessment regarding the Taxes to be indemnified
under this Section 7.2 becomes final and binding (the period through the
expiration date being referred to as the " _Purchaser Tax Indemnification
Period_ "); _provided_ that in the event a Seller Parent Tax Claim Notice has
been received by Purchaser within such period, the covenants and agreements
that are the subject of such Seller Parent Tax Claim Notice (and such claim
itself), as applicable, shall survive with respect to such claim until such
time as such claim is finally resolved.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Allocation of Transaction Consideration_.

 



 

(a) The Cash Consideration Amount, the fair market value of the Consideration
Shares and any other amounts that are treated as consideration for applicable
Tax purposes shall be allocated prior to Closing among the various members of
the Seller Parent Group as mutually agreed between Purchaser and Seller Parent
and according to the principles set forth in Annex 24 (such allocation, the "
_Consideration Allocation_ "). If the Transaction Consideration is adjusted in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement for purposes of the Cash
Consideration Amount, Purchaser and Seller Parent shall restate the
Consideration Allocation as appropriate to reflect the adjustments. Purchaser
and Seller Parent shall be bound to the extent legally permissible by the
Consideration Allocation (as adjusted) for purposes of determining any Taxes
and shall prepare and file, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
prepare and file, their Tax Returns (including U.S. Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594) on a basis consistent with the Consideration Allocation and defend
the agreed Consideration Allocation before any Government Entity. To the
extent legally permissible, neither Party shall take in the preparation of any
statutory financial statements, the filing of any Tax returns or in the course
of any Tax Contest any position inconsistent with the Consideration Allocation
as restated by the parties from time to time, but this obligation shall, for
the avoidance of doubt, not prevent Seller Parent or Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates from disclosing any relevant facts and circumstances to
the relevant Government Entity in order to comply with applicable Law. Each
Party shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, cause each Local
Asset Purchase Agreement to reflect any allocation agreed to hereunder.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but solely to the extent Purchaser and
Seller Parent are required by applicable Law to agree on the amount or value
of the Seller Shares or of a particular Transferred Asset or a particular
Assumed Liability for purposes of any Transfer Taxes or VAT and such value
cannot be directly derived from the Consideration Allocation, Purchaser and
Seller Parent shall mutually agree on a good faith estimate of the fair market
value of such asset or Liability prior to the date any Transfer Tax or VAT
filing is required to be made or any such Transfer Tax or VAT payment is
required to be paid (including applicable extensions). Purchaser and Seller
Parent understand and agree that any agreement reached pursuant to this
Section 7.3(b) is

 



     

 

 



 

reached solely for purposes of Transfer Tax or VAT filings and payments
required under applicable Law, and shall in no way be regarded by the parties
as conclusive with respect to the Consideration Allocation unless expressly
required under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Consideration Allocation shall be amended to reflect any adjustment to
the Transaction Consideration pursuant to Section 7.13.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Tax Refunds, Overprovisions and Tax Overstatements_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations as set forth in Section 7.4(e) below, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller Parent an amount equal to:

 



 

(i) any Tax refund, credit that offsets a Tax liability or similar benefit
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) received by
Purchaser, a Transferred Entity or any other Affiliate of Purchaser and
relating to Taxes which have been paid or otherwise settled by any Transferred
Entity prior to or on the Closing Date in respect of the Pre-Closing Period
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any refund of Excluded Taxes as a
consequence of an amendment or a rescission of the relevant Tax assessment
which led to an indemnity payment by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.1) ("
_Tax Refund_ ") to the extent that the aggregate amount of Tax Refunds after
application of the reductions provided in Section 7.4(b) and subject to this
Section 7.4(a)(i) exceeds the aggregate amount of Tax Refunds that are shown
or provided for in the Closing Date Statement and that have increased the
Transaction Consideration as part of the Closing Net Tax Position;

 



 

(ii) the amount of (x) the aggregate of all Tax liabilities, Tax accruals
and/or Taxes being part of other liabilities or other accruals as shown or
provided for in the Closing Date Statement which have both reduced the
Transaction Consideration as part of the Closing Net Tax Position, and are
determined to be overprovisions or overpayments under applicable accounting
standards exceeds the amount of (y) the aggregate of Tax assets, Tax Refunds
or Tax benefits as shown or provided for in the Closing Date Statement which
have both increased the Transaction Consideration as part of the Closing Net
Tax Position, and are determined to be overprovisions or overpayments under
applicable accounting standards; _provided_ , that if the amount pursuant to
clause (y) exceeds the amount pursuant to clause (x), Seller Parent shall pay
such amount to Purchaser;

 



 

(iii) the amount of any Tax Benefits, determined in accordance with Section
7.1(b)(ii), if and to the extent that circumstances (A) lead to Taxes, which
are owed by any member of the Seller Parent Group or any Affiliate of Seller
Parent, or reduce Tax losses or Tax loss carry forwards of any member of the
Seller Parent Group or any Affiliate of Seller Parent, in each case due to the
fact that Taxes on the taxable income of the relevant Transferred Entity are
assessed directly against a member of the Seller Parent Group or any Affiliate
of Seller Parent due to the existence of a consolidated, affiliated, combined
or unitary Tax group or similar Tax consolidation scheme (such consolidated,
affiliated, combined or unitary Tax group or similar Tax

 



     

 

 



 

consolidation scheme a " _Tax Group_ ") and (B) result in Tax Benefits of any
Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entities) in or for a period starting
on the Closing Date unless and to the extent such Tax Benefit has already
reduced a claim against Seller Parent pursuant to Section 9.8(c); and

 



 

(iv) the amount of any Tax Benefits, determined in accordance with Section
7.1(b)(ii), if and to the extent that adjustments by any Government Entity
after the Closing Date (including on the basis of a Tax audit) of the
consideration for transactions between a member of the Seller Parent Group or
any Affiliate of Seller Parent, on the one hand, and a Transferred Entity, on
the other hand, consummated before the Closing Date have led or could lead to
a Tax Benefit of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser for periods after the
Closing Date unless and to the extent such Tax Benefit has already reduced a
claim against Seller Parent pursuant to Section 9.8(c).

 



 

(b) Any payment by Purchaser to Seller Parent or by Seller Parent to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be reduced by (i) the amount of Taxes which
are levied on the receipt of a Tax Refund and/or the amounts described in
Section 7.4(a)(ii), (iii) and (iv) or any other liabilities associated with
the Tax Refund and/or the amounts described in Section 7.4(a)(ii), (iii) and
(iv) and which have to be paid by Seller Parent, a Transferred Entity,
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, as applicable and (ii) any Tax
disadvantage arising from a Tax Refund and/or the amounts described in Section
7.4(a)(ii) (such Tax disadvantage to be determined in accordance with the
principles set forth in Section 7.1(b) which shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ ).
If, after Purchaser has made a payment to Seller Parent under this Section
7.4, the relevant Tax Refund is subsequently reduced or disallowed as a
consequence of an amendment or a rescission of the relevant Tax assessment,
Seller Parent shall promptly (but no later than five (5) days following notice
of such reduction or disallowance being provided to Seller Parent) refund to
the Purchaser the amount of such reduced or disallowed Tax Refund.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall notify Seller Parent and Seller Parent shall notify
Purchaser without undue delay of any payment obligation pursuant to Section
7.4(a). A claim of Seller Parent against Purchaser or of Purchaser against
Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall become due and payable after
(i) five (5) Business Days after receipt by Purchaser, a Transferred Entity or
any other Affiliate of Purchaser of the relevant Tax Refund by way of actual
payment from the applicable Governmental Entity, set-off or in any other cash-
effective manner, or (ii) the respective over or understated liabilities
and/or accruals have to be dissolved under applicable accounting standards.

 



 

(d) The provisions of Section 7.1(c) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to claims
brought pursuant to this Section 7.4.

 



 

(e) Seller Parents claims and Purchasers claims pursuant to Section 7.4(a)
and Section 7.4(b) shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days following
the later of (i) the receipt of Purchasers notification pursuant to Section
7.1(e)) or (ii) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation (taking
into account any extension, suspension, tolling or interruption of the statute
of limitation) for the Taxes for

 



     

 

 



 

which the items described in Section 7.4(a)(ii) were shown or provided for in
the respective Closing Date Statement; _provided_ that in the event a claim
notice has been received by Purchaser within such period, the covenants and
agreements that are the subject of such claim notice (and such claim itself)
shall survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is
finally resolved.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Allocation of Taxes and Tax Refunds in a Straddle Period_. For
purposes of determining the amount of any Taxes relating to any Straddle
Period, the amount of any Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Accounts
Time and as if the relevant taxable period and the relevant fiscal year ended
at the Closing Accounts Time, except that (i) Tax items of a periodic nature
or measured by the level of any item such as, but not limited to, real and
personal ad valorem property Taxes or depreciation allowances calculated on an
annual basis, shall be determined based on apportioning a pro-rata portion of
such Taxes to each day in the relevant Straddle Period so that the amount of
any such Taxes for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Excluded Taxes for the entire taxable
period _multiplied by_ a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on the day before the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period and (ii)
any transaction relating to the Transferred Assets, the Business or the
Transferred Entities that is initiated by Seller Parent or its Affiliates and
occurs on the Closing Date before the Closing outside the Ordinary Course
(other than a Divestiture Action for which Purchaser is responsible for the
relevant Tax under Section 5.3(d)) shall also be treated as occurring during
the Pre-Closing Period. This principle shall apply _mutatis mutandis_
regarding the calculation of any Tax Benefit and any Tax Refund for a Straddle
Period and in particular any (advance) Tax payments made in the Pre-Closing
Period shall only be attributed to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
before the Closing Date and may lead to a Tax Refund claim by Seller Parent
pursuant to Section 7.4 even if the respective Transferred Entity is required
to pay Taxes for the taxable period in which the Closing occurs.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Further Provisions in relation to Tax Groups_. The Parties
acknowledge that Seller Parent on the one hand and BAH GmbH and KVP GmbH (the
" _German Transferred Entities_ ") on the other hand form part of a VAT group
( _umsatzsteuerliche Organschaft_ ) with Seller Parent as parent ( _Organtr
ager_) (" _VAT Group_ ") and that Bayer HealthCare Animal Health Inc. forms
part of a consolidated group for U.S. income tax purposes with Bayer US
Holding LP as common parent. The Parties further acknowledge that the VAT
Group will continue to exist until the Closing Date. In light of the
foregoing, the Parties agree that:

 



 

(a) Unless and to the extent explicitly provided otherwise herein, Seller
Parent will not and will cause its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Transferred Entities) not to raise any claims under Section 7.2(a)
of this Agreement for Taxes attributable to the Closing Date (unless such
Taxes arise from a transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing
outside the Ordinary Course) or other contractual or statutory compensation
claims against the Purchaser, any Transferred Entity or any Affiliate of the
Purchaser in connection with or relating to the U.S.

 



     

 

 



 

consolidated group that Bayer HealthCare Animal Health Inc. forms part of for
U.S. income tax purposes (such claims, the " _Purchaser U.S. Consolidation
Claims_ "), unless and to the extent the corresponding liability of the
respective Transferred Entity has decreased the Transaction Consideration as
part of the Closing Net Tax Position. Seller Parent will indemnify, hold
harmless and reimburse the Purchaser, the Transferred Entity and any Affiliate
of the Purchaser from any Purchaser U.S. Consolidation Claims raised by Seller
Parent or an Affiliate of Seller Parent, unless and to the extent explicitly
provided otherwise herein.

 



 

(b) Unless and to the extent explicitly provided otherwise herein, Purchaser
will not and will cause its Affiliates (including any Transferred Entity after
the Closing) not to raise any contractual or statutory compensation claims
against Seller Parent or any Affiliate of Seller Parent in connection with or
relating to the U.S. consolidated group that Bayer HealthCare Animal Health
Inc. forms part of for U.S. income tax purposes (such claims, the " _Seller
U.S. Consolidation Claims"_ ), unless and to the extent such claim of a
Transferred Entity has increased the Transaction Consideration as part of the
Closing Net Tax Position. The Purchaser will indemnify, hold harmless and
reimburse Seller Parent from any Seller U.S. Consolidation Claims raised by
the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser (including any Transferred
Entity after the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
7.6(b) shall reduce or eliminate any liability of Seller Parent or any
Affiliate of Seller Parent for Taxes described under clause (iii) of the
definition of Excluded Taxes.

 



 

(c) Any VAT which relates to any of the German Transferred Entities and the
Pre-Closing Period shall be solely borne by Seller Parent. Following the
Closing, Seller Parent shall not, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries
not to, raise any contractual or statutory compensation claims against
Purchaser, any German Transferred Entity or any Affiliate of Purchaser in
connection with or relating to the VAT Group (such claims, the " _Purchaser
VAT Group Claims_ "), unless and to the extent (i) the corresponding Liability
of the respective German Transferred Entity has decreased the Transaction
Consideration or (ii) the German Transferred Entity can recover such amount
from a third party or from a Government Entity and such recovered amount has
not increased the Transaction Consideration. Seller Parent shall indemnify,
hold harmless and reimburse Purchaser, the German Transferred Entities and any
Affiliate of Purchaser from any Purchaser VAT Group Claims raised by Seller
Parent or the Retained Subsidiaries, unless and to the extent expressly
provided otherwise herein.

 



 

(d) Any refund of VAT which relates to any of the German Transferred Entities
and the Pre-Closing Period shall be solely for the benefit of Seller Parent.
Following the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including any German Transferred Entity after the Closing) not to, raise any
contractual or statutory compensation claims against Seller Parent or any
Affiliate of Seller Parent in connection with or relating to the VAT Group
(such claims, the " _Seller VAT Group Claims_ "), unless and to the extent (i)
such claim of a German Transferred Entity has increased the Transaction
Consideration or (ii) the Transferred Company or Affiliate of Purchaser is
subject to a claim of a third party or a Government Entity in respect of such
amount and such claim has not decreased the Transaction Consideration.
Purchaser shall

 



     

 

 



 

indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse Seller Parent from any Seller VAT Group
Claims raised by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser (including any
Transferred Entity after the Closing), unless and to the extent expressly
provided herein.

 



 

(e) Following Closing, with respect to the German Transferred Entities as a
member of the VAT Group with Seller Parent prior to Closing, the following
shall apply notwithstanding Section 7.6(c) and Section 7.6(d) (which shall
otherwise remain unaffected): If and to the extent VAT which relates to a
supply or service actually rendered by any of the German Transferred Entities
on or prior to the Closing Date increases a VAT Liability or reduces an input
VAT credit or refund, in each case of Seller Parent vis-a-vis a Government
Entity, Purchaser shall pay to Seller Parent as soon as reasonably practicable
the amount of such VAT if and to the extent that (i) any of the German
Transferred Entities has received such VAT as part of a payment from a third
Person after the Closing Date, (ii) the claim for such payment has not
increased the Cash Consideration Amount, and (iii) neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates nor any of the German Transferred Entities is otherwise
obliged to reimburse Seller Parent or any other Affiliate of Seller Parent for
the amount received from the third Person. If and to the extent Seller Parent
receives any input VAT credit or refund from a Government Entity or benefits
from a decreased VAT Liability which relates to a supply or service actually
received by any of the German Transferred Entities prior to or on the Closing
Date (without regard to whether the respective invoice is issued before or
after the Closing Date), Seller Parent shall pay as soon as reasonably
practicable to Purchaser the amount of such input VAT credit, refund or
benefit if and to the extent that (i) any of the German Transferred Entities
has paid such VAT as part of an obligation for payment to a third Person after
the Closing Date, (ii) the Liability for such payment has not decreased the
Cash Consideration Amount as part of the Closing Net Tax Position and (iii)
neither Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates is otherwise obliged to
reimburse Purchaser, any of the German Transferred Entities or any other
Affiliate of Purchaser for the amount paid to the third Person.

 



 

(f) Following Closing, Purchaser shall cause any German Transferred Entity
being a member of the VAT Group with Seller Parent as parent until the Closing
Date, to provide Seller Parent without undue delay with any document and
information relating to such German Transferred Entity reasonably required or
reasonably requested by Seller Parent in connection with the filing of any Tax
Return in relation to such VAT Group to the extent that such document or
information was either in the possession of the German Transferred Entity at
the time of Closing or can be obtained by the German Transferred Entity with
reasonable efforts thereafter.

 



 

(g) Each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, cooperate to avoid or mitigate any
VAT applicable to any member of the VAT Group, including by issuing invoices
complying with the applicable VAT Law.

 



 

(h) In the event that Seller Parent or any Affiliate of Seller Parent
recognizes a loss on a sale of any Seller Shares in the transactions
contemplated herein that, absent an election to the contrary, would result in
a reduction in the "Category D

 



     

 

 



 

attributes" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36) of any
Transferred Entity pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36(d)(4)(ii), Seller Parent shall, or shall cause the relevant
Affiliate of Seller Parent or the applicable common parent of the consolidated
group of which such Transferred Entity is a member to, make an effective
election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6) so that no
such reduction in "Category D attributes" shall occur. Purchaser and Seller
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in
good faith in connection with determining whether an election is required
pursuant to this Section 7.6(h). Seller Parent shall timely provide Purchaser
with a copy of the "Section 1.1502-36 Statement", if any, filed in connection
with any election made under this Section 7.6(h).

 



 

Section 7.7 _Cooperation_. With respect to the Transferred Entities, the
Transferred Assets and the Business, each Party shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser, any Transferred
Entity) to:

 



 

(a) to the extent permissible under applicable Law, cooperate to utilize, or
cause its respective Affiliates, as applicable, to utilize an appropriate
procedure, as set forth in Internal Revenue Service Rev. Proc. 2004-53, to
report wages and compensation of Transferred Employees with respect to which
wages and compensation is required to be reported for United States federal
employment tax purposes;

 



 

(b) make available to the other Party as reasonably requested all information,
records and documents relating to Taxes concerning the Transferred Entities,
the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Transferred Employees
and/or the Business or claims by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.4,
including information, records and documents necessary for preparing and
filing Tax Returns, in connection with any Tax Contests or in relation to any
Tax Refund, and provide the assistance of all officers and employees of the
Transferred Entities and the Business to the extent reasonably requested by
Seller Parent; and

 



 

(c) retain any Tax Returns and other books and records that could reasonably
be expected to be necessary or useful in connection with any preparation by
any other party of any Tax Returns, for any Tax Contest, for accounting
purposes or in connection with claims by Seller Parent pursuant to Section
7.4. Such books and records shall be retained until the later of the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any
extension, suspension, tolling or interruption of the statute of limitation)
or the expiration of any retention period under applicable Law.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and unless
required by applicable Laws, neither Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to provide any Person with any Tax Return or copy of any Tax
Return of (i) Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates or (ii) a consolidated,
combined, affiliated or unitary group that includes Seller Parent or any of
its Affiliates except, in each case, for materials or portions thereof
(including associated schedules and work papers) that relate solely to any of
the Transferred Entities, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or
the

 



      

 

 



 

Transferred Employees or _pro forma_ Tax Returns of any Transferred Entities
that show information relating solely to the Transferred Entities or
Transferred Assets.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns for each Transferred Entity that are filed after the
Closing Date which relate to the Pre-Closing Period (including any Straddle
Period) other than Income Tax Returns with respect to periods for which a
consolidated, unitary or combined income Tax Return of Seller Parent or its
Affiliates shall include the operations of such Transferred Entity (" _Pre-
Closing Separate Returns_ "). Pre-Closing Separate Returns shall be prepared
in accordance with past practice unless past practice does not comply with
applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, (i) drafts
of any Pre-Closing Separate Returns related to Income Taxes (including trade
tax returns) (" _Pre-Closing Separate Income Tax Returns_ ") to Seller Parent
no later than fifteen (15) Business days before the end of the respective
filing deadline of the respective Pre-Closing Separate Income Tax Return and
(ii) other material Tax Returns (including VAT returns, but not including
payroll tax, _ad valorem_ property tax or similar Tax Returns) (" _Other Pre-
Closing Returns_ ") a reasonable period of time (and in any event no later
than five (5) Business Days) before such Other Pre-Closing Returns are due.
Seller Parent has the right to review and provide reasonable comments on any
Pre-Closing Separate Return. All Pre-Closing Separate Returns that relate to
the Pre-Closing Period (but not the Straddle Period) to be filed by any
Transferred Entity (i) must only be filed after Seller Parent has provided its
written consent to the draft of the respective Pre-Closing Separate Return,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which
shall be deemed to be granted if Seller Parent has not provided reasonably
detailed, written comments in respect of any Pre-Closing Separate Income Tax
Return to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days of having received such Pre-
Closing Separate Income Tax Return or in respect of Other Pre-Closing Returns
within three (3) Business Days of having received such Other Pre-Closing
Return and (ii) if Seller Parent and Purchaser are required by clause (i)
herein to reach an agreement regarding the amendment of the draft of a Tax
Return based on the comments provided by Seller Parent and fail to reach such
agreement, shall be prepared and filed in accordance with Seller Parents
instructions unless these instructions are inconsistent with past practice or
do not comply with applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Seller Parent shall provide comments on all Pre-Closing Separate Returns
that relate to a Straddle Period within the same period specified in Section
7.8(a). Purchaser shall consider such comments in good faith and if Seller
Parent and Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement regarding the amendment
of the draft of a Pre-Closing Separate Return that relates to such Straddle
Period based on comments provided by Seller Parent, (i) with respect to any
portion of such return that relates solely to Excluded Taxes, such portion
shall be prepared and filed in accordance with Seller Parents instructions
unless these instructions are inconsistent with past practice or do not comply
with applicable Law and (ii) with respect to any portion of such return that
relates solely to Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section
7.2, such portion shall be filed consistent with Purchasers position;
provided, that in each case, no position shall be

 



     

 

 



 

taken on any such return that would materially increase the Tax liability of
the other party without the other partys consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event Purchaser and
Seller Parent are required herein to reach an agreement on any item with
respect to any Pre-Closing Separate Return with respect to a Straddle Period
and fail to reach agreement with respect to an item that affects a Tax
liability that is allocated to both Seller Parent under Section 7.1 and
Purchaser under Section 7.2, the items in dispute will be submitted to the CPA
Firm and the dispute resolution mechanics of Section 2.10(d) shall govern. The
fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be borne equally by Purchaser and
Seller Parent. Any relevant Tax Returns shall be amended to reflect the
decision of the CPA Firm.

 



 

(c) Without duplication of any amounts included in the Closing Date Statement
that have decreased the Transaction Consideration, Seller Parent shall pay to
Purchaser the amount shown as due on any Tax Return for which it has an
indemnification obligation under Section 7.1 at least five (5) Business Days
before the due date of any payment pursuant to such an applicable Tax Return.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Amended Tax Returns and Retroactive Elections_. Purchaser shall
not, and shall not permit any Affiliate (including after Closing any
Transferred Entity) to, (i) amend any Tax Returns filed with respect to any
Pre-Closing Period or with respect to any Straddle Period or (ii) make any Tax
Election that has retroactive effect to any such Tax year or to any Straddle
Period, in each such case without the prior written consent of Seller Parent
(not to be unreasonably withheld), or (iii) without the consent of Seller
Parent, make any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall be
entitled to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to
any Transferred Entity, _provided_ , _however_ , that if Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates makes an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any
similar applicable provision of state, local or foreign Law) with respect to a
Transferred Entity or Subsidiary thereof that is treated as a domestic
corporation for purposes of Section 7701(a)(4) of the Code, then
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including Section 7.1),
Purchaser and its Affiliates (rather than Seller Parent and its Affiliates)
will bear any associated Taxes.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Information, Cooperation and Instruction Rights of Seller Parent
in relation to Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall provide Seller Parent with a copy of any document received
by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) from any
Government Entity or a court in relation to Taxes (including any notices,
requests or other documents in connection with a Tax Contest or any Tax
assessment notice) and any information regarding a Tax Contest without undue
delay if and to the extent that such document or information relates to
Excluded Taxes, Taxes to be indemnified pursuant to Section 7.2 or a potential
claim by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.4.

 



 

(b) Seller Parent and/or one or several Representatives of Seller Parent bound
to secrecy by professional code shall be entitled to fully participate (at
Seller

 



     

 

 



 

Parents cost) from the beginning onwards in any Tax Contest including
meetings with any Government Entity or court hearings if and to the extent
such Tax Contest relates to Excluded Taxes, Taxes to be indemnified pursuant
to Section 7.2 or a potential claim by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.4
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax Contest involving the KVP
Agreement to the extent relating to the Pre-Closing Period). Purchaser shall
inform Seller Parent of the ongoing process of such Tax Contest and allow
Seller Parent and/or one or several Representatives of Seller Parent bound to
secrecy by professional code to discuss all actions or measures of the
respective Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser in
connection with such Tax Contest with the respective Transferred Entity,
Purchaser or the respective Affiliate of Purchaser, as the case may be. Any
acquiescence or settlement during or at the end of such Tax Contest relating
to Excluded Taxes or Section 7.4 shall require the prior written consent of
Seller Parent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed for any
Tax Contest.

 



 

(c) Upon Seller Parents written request Purchaser shall, or shall cause a
Transferred Entity or another Affiliate of Purchaser, as the case may be, in
accordance with Seller Parents instructions, unless such instructions do not
comply with applicable Law, to file, withdraw or amend legal remedies in
respect of any Tax assessments, any Tax Contest or any other act or measure by
any Government Entity or any court in relation to Taxes if and to the extent
that such Tax assessment, Tax Contest or other act or measure relate solely to
Excluded Taxes, or a potential claim by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.4.
Seller Parent shall bear all external costs reasonably incurred by the
respective Transferred Entity, the respective Affiliate of Purchaser or
Purchaser in connection with the filing, withdrawal or amendments of legal
remedies upon Seller Parents instructions. If Seller Parent requests to
pursue a Tax Contest in relation solely to Excluded Taxes or a potential claim
by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.4 (including challenges to Tax
assessments or appeals against court decisions) on its own or through a
counsel of its choice and at its expense, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliate to, authorize without undue delay (by power of attorney and such
other documentation as may be necessary or appropriate), the designated
Representative of Seller Parent to represent Purchaser or its Affiliate, as
the case may be, in the relevant Tax Contest. Seller Parent shall not settle
or resolve any Tax Contest in a way that has a material adverse effect on
Purchaser or its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Purchaser
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, submit to any
Government Entity, any material document or material information relating
solely to Excluded Taxes, or a potential claim by Seller Parent pursuant to
Section 7.4, without the prior written consent of Seller Parent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless such document or
information must be provided to the respective Government Entity under
applicable Law.

 



 

(e) For any Tax Contest that relates to both (i) Excluded Taxes or a potential
claim by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 7.4 on the one hand and (ii) Taxes
for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section 7.2 or a potential
claim by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.4 on the other hand, Seller Parent
shall control the portion of the

 



     

 

 



 

Tax Contest described in Section 7.10(e)(i) and Purchaser shall control the
portion of the Tax Contest described in Section 7.10(e)(ii) (for the avoidance
of doubt, without prejudice to the silent participation and information rights
of Purchaser under Section 7.11, Seller Parent shall have control of any Tax
Contests that exclusively relate to periods prior to the Pre-Closing Period,
including Tax audits in Germany for the taxable periods 2013 to 2015, 2016 to
2018 and the portion of any subsequent audit in Germany that relates to the
Pre-Closing Period); _provided_ , that neither party shall settle, compromise
and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest in a manner that would
materially increase the Tax liability of the other party without the consent
of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). In the event that the control of any Tax Contest described in
this Section 7.10(e) cannot be divided, such Tax Contest shall be jointly
controlled by Seller Parent and Purchaser.

 



 

Section 7.11 _German Tax Audit Issue_.

 



 

(a) The Transferred Entities BAH GmbH and KVP GmbH are currently undergoing a
Tax audit in Germany for the taxable periods 2013 to 2015 (" _German Tax
Audit_ "). With effect from the beginning of the taxable period 2012 neither
BAH GmbH nor KVP GmbH have formed part of a Tax group for purposes of German
corporate income Taxes and trade Taxes ( _k orperschaftsteuerliche und
gewerbesteuerliche Organschaft_) and therefore both Transferred Entities have
been taxed on a stand-alone basis since then. In the course of the ongoing
German Tax Audit, the German tax authorities raised an issue with respect to
the payments by KVP GmbH to BAH GmbH under the KVP Agreement. According to the
view taken by the German tax authorities, such payments are to be reclassified
as deemed dividends ( _verdeckte Gewinnaussch uttungen_) by KVP GmbH to BAH
GmbH (" _German Tax Audit s Current View_"). The business model underlying
the KVP Agreement remained unchanged until (and (including) the taxable period
2018 (see Section 7.11(g)), and therefore also payments made or payment
obligations incurred by KVP GmbH in the taxable periods 2016 to 2018 could be
reclassified as deemed dividends (the potential reclassification of any
payments or payments obligations under the KVP Agreement herein the " _German
Tax Audit Issue_ ").

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall have, in respect of the German Tax Audit Issue, from the
date hereof until the Closing Date the same information and participation
rights which are granted to Seller Parent in Section 7.10(a) and the first and
second sentences of Section 7.10(b), it being understood that the
participation rights shall be limited to the silent participation of one
representative bound to secrecy by professional code of Purchaser in meetings
with a Government Entity to the extent concerning the German Tax Audit Issue.

 



 

(c) Should a Tax assessment (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an
amendment or rescission of a Tax assessment) be issued which is fully or
partially in accordance with the German Tax Audits Current View, the Parties
expect that this would result in Excluded Taxes for the taxable periods
concerning the German Tax Audit and the taxable periods 2016 to 2018 ("
_German Tax Audit Taxes_ "). For the avoidance of

 



     

 

 



 

doubt, and without limiting the generality of any clause in this Article VII,
the Parties acknowledge that any German Tax Audit Taxes are indemnifiable
under Section 7.1(a).

 



 

(d) Should a Tax assessment be issued which is fully or partially in
accordance with the German Tax Audits Current View, the Parties expect that
this would result in Tax Refunds for the taxable periods concerning the German
Tax Audit and the taxable periods 2016 to 2018 (" _German Tax Audit Tax
Refunds_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality
of any clause in this Article VII, the Parties acknowledge that any German Tax
Audit Tax Refunds are payable under Section 7.4(a).

 



 

(e) Should Tax assessments be issued which are fully or partially in
accordance with the German Tax Audits Current View, the Parties expect that
this would result in loss carryforwards arising for purposes of German
corporate income Taxes and German trade Taxes at the level of the Transferred
Entities (" _German Tax Audit LCFs_ "). With respect to the German Tax Audit
LCFs which have not been utilized by the Closing Date or have not reduced the
Tax Indemnity pursuant to Section 7.1(a), the Parties acknowledge that such
German Tax Audit LCFs can result in Tax Benefits within the meaning of Section
7.1(b), including, for the avoidance of doubt, the refund of such Tax
Benefits, if and to the extent they are not forfeited as a consequence of the
consummation of this Agreement. The German Tax Audit LCFs which, taking into
account any potential forfeiture upon consummation of this Agreement, are
available immediately after the consummation of this Agreement, shall be
computed on the basis of the Straddle Period Tax Returns for BAH GmbH and KVP
GmbH in accordance with Section 7.5, provided that any later Tax assessment
which deviates from such computation shall be binding on the Parties for
purposes of calculating any claims under this Article VII.

 



 

(f) Should the German Tax Audits view still be fully or partly in line with
the German Tax Audits Current View once the German Tax Audit is completed,
the Parties acknowledge that BAH GmbH and/or KVP GmbH have to submit
disclosure letters to the competent Government Entity concerning the taxable
periods 2016 to 2018 which enables the Government Entity to issue amended Tax
assessments for any of the taxable periods 2016 to 2018 in accordance with the
German Tax Audits Current View. The Parties agree that the filing of such
disclosure letters does not constitute a breach of any provision set forth in
this Article VII and does not exclude or reduce the Tax Indemnity pursuant to
Section 7.1(a).

 



 

(g) The Parties understand that actions have been taken which aim at creating
a situation in which the German Tax Audit Issue should, in general, no longer
be relevant for the taxable periods from 2019 onwards due to a change in the
business model of KVP GmbH and BAH GmbH. For the avoidance of doubt, and
without limiting the generality of any clause in this Article VII, the Parties
acknowledge that any Excluded Taxes resulting from such any such action at the
level of BAH GmbH or KVP GmbH is indemnifiable under Section 7.1(a), and the
Parties further acknowledge for the avoidance of doubt that, if and to the
extent the German Tax Audit Issue should, contrary to the expectation of the
Seller Parent, remain relevant also in taxable periods from 2019 onwards until
the Closing Date, any Tax resulting therefrom at the level of BAH GmbH or KVP
GmbH is indemnifiable under Section 7.1(a).

 



     

 

 



 

(h) Should, _e_. _g_. following a decision by a tax court, a Tax assessment
which was fully or partially in accordance with the German Tax Audits Current
View, be fully or partly reversed, the Parties expect that this could result
(i) in reimbursements by the German Governmental Entities for German Tax Audit
Taxes (plus interest) to the German Transferred Entities (" _Reimbursement of
German Audit Taxes_ ") as well as in (ii) repayment obligations by the German
Transferred Entities for German Tax Audit Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits
resulting from German Tax Audit LCFs (plus interest) (" _Repayment of German
Audit Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_ ") towards the German Governmental
Entities. With respect to these reimbursements and repayment obligations, the
Parties agree as follows:

 



 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of any
clause in this Article VII, the Parties acknowledge that any Repayments of
German Audit Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits are indemnifiable under Section
7.1(a).

 



 

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of any
clause in this Article VII, the Parties acknowledge that any Reimbursements of
German Audit Taxes are payable under Section 7.4(a). The Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to agree upon and to implement a mechanism whereby the
corresponding reimbursement claim of the relevant German Transferred Entity
against the competent Governmental Entity is effectively assigned to Seller
Parent (x) if the German Audit Taxes have been paid prior to Closing, promptly
after Closing and (y) if the German Audit Taxes have not been paid prior to
Closing, as soon as the German Tax Audit Taxes have been indemnified under
Section 7.1(a).

 



 

Section 7.12 _Transfer Taxes and VAT_.

 



 

(a) Any Transfer Taxes that are, or become, due and payable as a result of the
Contemplated Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
transaction under any Transaction Agreements), whether such Taxes are imposed
on the Transferred Entities, any member of the Seller Parent Group or any
Affiliate of Seller Parent, the Transferred Assets or Purchaser (other than
VAT), shall be borne by Purchaser. Purchaser shall pay to Seller Parent the
amount of any Transfer Taxes that Purchaser is liable for pursuant to this
Section 7.12(a) that are required to be remitted to a Government Entity by
Seller Parent or any member of the Seller Parent Group or any other Affiliate
of Seller Parent no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date such
Transfer Taxes are due. Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with
any Transfer Taxes (" _Transfer Tax Returns_ ") shall be prepared by Purchaser
as soon as possible taking the filing deadline for the respective Transfer Tax
Return into account. Purchaser shall provide drafts of any Transfer Tax
Returns to Seller Parent a reasonable period of time (and in any event no
later than five (5) Business Days) prior to the filing deadline of the
relevant Transfer Tax Return. Purchaser shall consider in good faith any
comments provided by Seller Parent on any such Transfer Tax Return by Seller
Parent. Seller Parent shall be entitled to prepare and file the Transfer Tax
Returns, to the extent that either (i) such Transfer Tax Returns must be filed
by Seller Parent under applicable Law, or (ii) if Purchaser has failed to
comply with its obligations set forth in the preceding sentences in connection
with the preparation and filing of a Transfer Tax

 



     

 

 



 

Return. If Seller Parent prepares a Transfer Tax Return pursuant to clause (i)
of the preceding sentence, Seller Parent shall bear any out-of-pocket costs
for professional, legal and accounting services in connection with the
preparation and/or filing of such Transfer Tax Return; if Seller Parent
prepares a Transfer Tax Return pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence, Purchaser shall compensate and reimburse Seller Parent for any out-
of-pocket costs for professional, legal and accounting services in connection
with the preparation and/or filing of such Transfer Tax Return. Seller Parent
and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in minimizing the amount of any
Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law (including by
providing any information or preparing any documentation that may be necessary
or useful for obtaining any available mitigation, reduction or exemption from
any Transfer Taxes) and with respect to the filing of Transfer Tax Returns.
Seller Parent and Purchaser are aware of their obligation to notify the
competent German Tax authorities of the Contemplated Transactions within two
(2) weeks after the date hereof pursuant to §§ 19, 20 of the German Real
Estate Transfer Tax Act ( _Grunderwerbsteuergesetz_ ) (" _RETT Notification
Obligation_ "). Seller Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with Purchaser to provide all information regarding Seller Parent, the
Transferred Entities and the relevant real estate which is required to meet
the RETT Notification Obligation.

 



 

(b) The Transaction Consideration as well as any amounts owed by Seller Parent
under this Agreement shall be exclusive of any VAT properly chargeable on the
supply under any applicable Law.

 



 

(c) No Party shall waive any exemption from VAT applicable to any Transaction
pursuant to section 9 German VAT Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz - UStG_ ) or any
comparable provision of foreign VAT Laws.

 



 

(d) The Parties assume that the sale and transfer of the Seller Shares is
exempt from VAT and will treat the sale and transfer of the Seller Shares
accordingly (in particular, in their VAT returns). If and to the extent that,
contrary to this assumption, the competent Government Entity holds that VAT is
chargeable on the sale and transfer of the Seller Shares despite the fact that
neither Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates has waived any exemption from
VAT, Purchaser shall, against issuance of a proper invoice, pay to Seller
Parent an amount equal to such VAT falling due on that part of the Transaction
Consideration which pursuant to Section 7.3 is allocable to the Seller Shares
if and to the extent such VAT is not owed by Purchaser (e.g., under the
reverse charge regime).

 



 

(e) The Parties assume that the issuance of the Consideration Shares is exempt
from VAT and will treat the issuance of the Consideration Shares accordingly
(in particular, in their VAT returns). If and to the extent that, contrary to
this assumption, the competent Government Entity holds that VAT is chargeable
on the issuance of the Consideration Shares despite the fact that Purchaser
has not waived any exemption from VAT, Seller Parent shall, against issuance
of a proper invoice, pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such VAT falling due
on the issuance of the Consideration Shares if and to the extent such VAT is
not owed by Seller Parent (e.g., under the reverse charge regime).

 



     

 

 



 

(f) With respect to the VAT implications of the sale and transfer of the
Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, the Parties
agree as follows:

 



 

(i) The Local Asset Purchase Agreements shall provide for the VAT treatment of
the respective transaction in accordance with the principles set out in this
Section 7.12 and, in particular, Section 7.12(f)(ii) through Section
7.12(f)(vii).

 



 

(ii) The Parties shall determine the VAT treatment of the respective
transaction as follows: As soon as this information is available, but no later
than forty-five (45) days prior to the reasonably expected Closing Date,
Seller Parent shall send to Purchaser a list of the countries and legal
entities involved in the various local sales and transfers of Transferred
Assets and assumptions of Assumed Liabilities. As soon as possible thereafter
but no later than thirty-five (35) days prior to the reasonably expected
Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide to Seller Parent such information on the
structuring considerations at the side of the Purchaser which can reasonably
be expected by Seller Parent to make an assessment of whether the respective
local asset transfer constitutes a non-taxable transfer of a going concern
within the meaning of Art. 19 and Art. 29 of the European Council Directive
2006/112/EC as transposed into the applicable Law of the relevant member state
or any similar provision under the VAT Laws of any other relevant jurisdiction
outside of the European Union (" _TOGC_ "). Within a reasonable time
thereafter but no later than twenty-five (25) days prior to the reasonably
expected Closing Date, Seller Parent shall provide Purchaser with a first
assessment as to whether, in a given transaction, a TOGC is present or not.
The Parties shall thereafter enter into a good faith discussion to determine
whether additional information on the TOGC treatment of a given transfer is
needed and the Purchaser shall provide Seller Parent with such information
reasonably requested to make an informed decision about the TOGC status of a
given transaction. Once such information is available to Seller Parent, Seller
Parent shall provide Purchaser with a reasonable assessment as to whether it
is more likely than not that in a given transaction a TOGC is present or not.

 



 

(iii) In the event that according to the Seller Parents assessment it is more
likely than not that no TOGC is present, Seller Parent shall provide the
Purchaser with a reasonably detailed assessment of what the envisaged VAT
implications of the respective transaction are (including, the type of the
taxable supplies and/or services, any applicable exemptions, the relevant
taxpayer, the applicable VAT rates and a good faith estimate of the relevant
VAT base) (" _Seller Parent s VAT Notice_"). Subject to the later actual
assessment of the VAT by the competent Government Entity, Seller Parents VAT
Notice shall be binding on the Parties and their respective Affiliates in
respect of the VAT treatment of the respective transaction for the purposes of
this Agreement and the Local Agreements, unless and to the extent Purchaser
has provided Seller Parent at the later of (i) ten (10) days after receipt of
Seller Parents VAT Notice and (ii) twenty (20) days prior to Closing with a
written notice in which Purchaser shall state if and to what extent Purchaser
objects to Seller Parents VAT Notice (" _Purchaser s VAT Objection
Notice_").

 



     

 

 



 

(iv) Seller Parent and Purchaser shall discuss in good faith and use best
efforts to resolve any objections raised in Purchasers VAT Objection Notice.
If the Parties are able to resolve the objection and to agree on a common
position on the VAT treatment of the relevant transaction, such agreement
shall be, subject to the later actual assessment of the VAT by the competent
Government Entity, binding on the Parties and their respective Affiliates in
respect of the VAT treatment of the relevant transaction for the purposes of
this Agreement and the Local Agreements.

 



 

(v) If the Parties are unable to resolve any objection within a reasonable
time prior to but no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the reasonably
expected Closing Date, they shall refer any remaining disagreement to a
reputable law or accounting firm in the relevant jurisdiction (" _Local VAT
Counsel_ ") to be jointly appointed by the Parties. The Local VAT Counsel
shall render its written assessment on what VAT treatment is more likely than
not within ten (10) days after its appointment ("Local VAT Counsels
Opinion"), and the Local VAT Counsels Opinion shall be, subject to the later
actual assessment of the VAT by the competent Government Entity, binding on
the Parties and their respective Affiliates in respect of the VAT treatment of
the relevant transaction for the purposes of this Agreement and the Local
Agreements. The fees and disbursements of the Local VAT Counsel shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Seller Parent.

 



 

(vi) If the respective transaction does, according to the binding
determination pursuant to Section 7.12(f)(ii)-(v), qualify as a TOGC, the
relevant Local Agreement shall provide that no VAT shall be chargeable on the
respective transactions and no VAT shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller Parent
and/or the Seller Ancillary Counterparty in respect of that part of the
Transaction Consideration which pursuant to Section 7.3 is allocable to the
respective transaction. The relevant Local Agreement shall, to the extent
applicable, further provide for the following: Seller Parent shall indemnify
Purchaser and its Affiliates from any VAT payable or any reduction of a claim
for a refund of VAT which results from (A) an adjustment of input VAT that has
been initially deducted by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates in respect
of any Transferred Asset (for instance, pursuant to section 15a German VAT Act
( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ )) if and to the extent that such adjustment is caused
by a change of the relevant circumstances prior to the Closing Date or (B) the
treatment of Purchaser or its Affiliates as the successor to Seller Parent or
any its Affiliates (for instance, pursuant to section 1 para. 1a 3rd sentence
of the German VAT Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ )). Seller Parent shall provide
Purchaser within one (1) month after the Closing Date without request with
copies of all documents required for any input VAT adjustment (as the case may
be) by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (for instance, pursuant to Section
15a German VAT Act). If and to the extent that, contrary to the binding
determination pursuant to Section 7.12(f)(ii)-(v), the competent Government
Entity holds that the relevant transaction does not constitute a TOGC and
therefore is subject to VAT, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith in
order to mitigate, to the extent legally permissible, any burden associated
with such assessment and shall use reasonable efforts to contest the VAT
assessment in cooperation with the other Party. In addition, if and to the
extent the competent Government Entity holds that the relevant transaction
does not constitute a TOGC, Section 7.12(f)(vii) shall apply accordingly.

 



     

 

 



 

(vii) If the relevant transaction does, according to the binding determination
pursuant to Section 7.12(f)(ii)-(v), not constitute a as TOGC, the relevant
Local Agreement shall provide that any VAT that is chargeable shall be borne
by such Party (or any of its Affiliates) which is the recipient of the
relevant supply or service in addition to the relevant consideration under any
Local Agreement at the time the relevant supply is made and shall be paid to
the other Party within ten (10) days after receipt of a proper invoice, if and
to the extent (i) the relevant supply or service is not exempt from VAT, (ii)
such VAT is not owed by the Party (or any of its Affiliates) which is the
recipient of the relevant supply or service under a reverse charge mechanism
or as a result of a secondary liability and (iii) such VAT has not become due
as a result of a breach of the covenant pursuant to Section 7.12(c) by the
other Party (or any of its Affiliates). The relevant Local Agreement shall, to
the extent applicable, further provide for the following: if and to the extent
that, contrary to the binding determination pursuant to Section
7.12(f)(ii)-(v), the competent Government Entity holds that the relevant
transaction is not subject to or is exempt from VAT, the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith in order to mitigate, to the extent legally
permissible, any burden associated with such assessment and take all steps
(including, the correction of invoices and the repayment of the amount which
was paid in respect of the VAT to the other Party) in order to put each other
(and their respective Affiliates) in the same position in which they were if
the Parties had assumed from the beginning that no VAT is chargeable. In
addition, if and to the extent the competent Government Entity holds that the
relevant transaction is not subject to VAT as it constitutes a TOGC, Section
7.12(f)(vi) shall apply accordingly.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Tax Treatment of Payments by Purchaser and Seller Parent under
this Agreement_. Payments made by Seller Parent (or its Subsidiaries) under
this Agreement shall be treated as a reduction of the Transaction
Consideration and payments made by Purchaser (or its Subsidiaries) under this
Agreement shall be treated as an increase of the Transaction Consideration,
each to the extent permitted under any applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.14 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy for Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, neither Party shall assert against the other Party
any claim, cause of action, right or remedy with respect to any Taxes relating
to this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions or any document or instrument
delivered in connection herewith or therewith, other than pursuant to this
Article VII (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereof).

 



 

(b) No Indemnified Party (other than Purchaser or Seller Parent or any of
their respective successors or permitted assigns) is entitled to assert any
claim, cause of action, right or remedy under this Agreement in connection
with Taxes unless and until Purchaser or Seller Parent or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns, as applicable, has provided
written consent to the other Party to the assertion of the indemnification
claim or the exercise of the other remedy by such Indemnified Party.

 



      

 

 



 

Section 7.15 _Applicability of Indemnification with Regard to Tax Matters_.

(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of all Losses
actually imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties as a result of the breach of any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser contained in Section 7.2(c), Section 7.3 or Section 7.5 through
Section 7.15.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing, Seller Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Transferred Entities) from, against and in respect of all Losses
actually imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred
Entities) as a result of the breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller
Parent contained in Section 5.26, Section 5.29, Section 7.3 or Section 7.5
through Section 7.15.

 



 

Section 7.16 _No Exclusion of Claims_. No claim under this Article VII is
excluded or limited for reason of any Party being aware or could have been
aware of facts or circumstances underlying the relevant claim; Section 442 of
the German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch  BGB_) and section 377 of
the German Commercial Code ( _Handelsgesetzbuch  HGB_) do not apply;
_provided_ , that any items set forth on the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall
not give rise to a claim for a breach of a Seller Parent representation or
warranty.

3.17(a) ( _Title to and Sufficiency of Transferred Assets_ ) and Section
3.17(c) ( _Title to and Sufficiency of Transferred Assets_ ), Seller
Fundamental Representations and Purchaser Fundamental Representations) and all
claims with respect thereto shall survive the Closing until the date which is
fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date, whereupon they shall terminate
and be without any further effect. All representations and

 



     

 

 



 

warranties contained in Section 3.17(a) ( _Title to and Sufficiency of
Transferred Assets_ ) and Section 3.17(c) ( _Title to and Sufficiency of

(other than the covenants and agreements contained in Section 5.26 (Tax

action, right or remedy, or commence any Proceeding, with respect to such
provision or the subject matter thereof; _provided_ that in the event notice
of any claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) or (ii) or Section

Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,

assigns, each in their capacity as such (the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_
"), from, against and in respect of any damages, losses, claims, charges,
Liabilities, Proceedings, payments, judgments, settlements, assessments,
deficiencies, taxes, interest, penalties, and fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and other

 



     

 

 



 

reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") actually
imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties as a result of:

 



 

(i) the breach of any representation and warranty of Seller Parent contained
in Article III (other than a breach of representation and warranty of Seller
Parent contained in Section 3.21); _provided_ that, for purposes of this
Article IX, the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.12 (
_Compliance with Laws_ ) shall be deemed to have been made both as of the date
of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) the breach of any covenant of Seller Parent contained in this Agreement
(other than a breach of any covenant or agreement contained in Article VII);
or

 



 

(iii) any of the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

(b) Seller Parent shall not be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for
any Losses resulting from any of the matters described in Section 9.2(a)(i)
that arise from any individual item, occurrence, circumstance, act or omission
(or series of related items, occurrences, circumstances, acts or omissions)
unless and until the amount of all Losses resulting therefrom exceeds two
hundred thousand Euro (200,000) (the " _De Minimis Deductible_ "), and then
only for such Losses in excess of the De Minimis Deductible. Seller Parent
shall not be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any
Losses resulting from the matters described in Section 9.2(a)(i) unless the
aggregate amount of such Purchaser Indemnified Party Losses (without taking
into account any Losses that do not exceed the De Minimis Deductible) exceeds
an amount equal to the product of 0.005 _multiplied by_ the Enterprise Value
(such product, the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent that the
aggregate amount of such Purchaser Indemnified Party Losses exceeds the
Deductible, as applicable, and does not exceed an amount equal to (i) the
product of 0.10 _multiplied by_ the Enterprise Value, _minus_ (ii) the amount
of Purchaser Indemnified Party Losses previously recovered by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article IX; _provided_ , that the De
Minimis Deductible and the Deductible shall not apply to Losses resulting from
the breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.17(a)
( _Title to and Sufficiency of Transferred Assets_ ) or Section 3.17(c) (
_Title to and Sufficiency of Transferred Assets_ ). The limitations set forth
in the previous sentence shall not apply to Losses resulting from Fraud or
breaches of any Seller Fundamental Representations, but Seller Parent shall
not be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses resulting
from breaches of any Seller Fundamental Representations that exceed an amount
equal to (x) the Enterprise Value (the " _Fundamental Cap_ ") _minus_ (y) the
amount of Purchaser Indemnified Party Losses previously recovered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article IX.

 



 

(c) To the extent this Section 9.2 imposes or gives rise to obligations on the
part of Seller Parent with regards to Purchaser Indemnified Parties other than
Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled to bring any and all claims on behalf
of such Purchaser Indemnified Party under this Agreement ( _Liquidation eines
Drittschadens_ ).

 



     

 

 



 

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, until the applicable survival dates provided in
Section 9.1, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller
Parent, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, shareholders,
partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents, Representatives and
employees and their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their
capacity as such (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ " and, collectively with
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from,
against and in respect of any Losses actually imposed on, sustained, incurred
or suffered by, any of the Seller Indemnified Parties as a result of:

 



 

(i) the breach of any representation and warranty of Purchaser contained in
Article IV; _provided_ that, for purposes of this Article IX, the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 ( _Compliance with
Laws_ ) shall be deemed to have been made both as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) the breach of a covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement (other
than a breach of any covenant or agreement contained in Article VII); or

 



 

(iii) any of the Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for any
Losses resulting from any of the matters described in Section 9.3(a)(i) that
arise from any individual item, occurrence, circumstance, act or omission (or
series of related items, occurrences, circumstances, acts or omissions) unless
and until the amount of all Losses resulting therefrom exceeds the De Minimis
Deductible, and then only for such Losses in excess of the De Minimis
Deductible. Purchaser shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties
with respect to any Losses resulting from the matters described in Section
9.3(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of such Seller Indemnified Party Losses
(without taking into account any Losses that do not exceed the De Minimis
Deductible) exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent that the
aggregate amount of such Seller Indemnified Party Losses exceeds the
Deductible, and does not exceed an amount equal to (i) the Share Consideration
Value _minus_ (ii) the amount of Seller Indemnified Party Losses previously
recovered by the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article IX or
otherwise. The limitations set forth in the previous sentence shall not apply
to Losses resulting from Fraud or breaches of any Purchaser Fundamental
Representations, but Purchaser shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified
Parties for any Losses resulting from breaches of any Purchaser Fundamental
Representations that exceed an amount equal to (x) the Fundamental Cap,
_minus_ (y) the amount of Seller Indemnified Party Losses previously recovered
by the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article IX or otherwise.

 



 

(c) To the extent this Section 9.3 imposes or gives rise to obligations on the
part of Purchaser with regards to Seller Indemnified Parties other than Seller
Parent, Seller Parent shall be entitled to bring any and all claims on behalf
of such Seller Indemnified Party under this Agreement ( _Liquidation eines
Drittschadens_ ).

 



     

 

 



 

Section 9.4 _Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying
party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may have liability to any Indemnified
Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any
Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) Business
Days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a Third Party Claim, notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party Claim, the amount or the
estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third
Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time
constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other
material details pertaining thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure timely to give a Claim Notice shall affect the
rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure
has a prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have fifteen (15) Business Days (or such fewer number of days set
forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the event
of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice
Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
power to direct and control such defense at its expense. The Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to, but not have any obligation to, participate in any such
defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. If the Indemnified
Party elects to participate and employ separate counsel, the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall not constitute Losses unless (i) the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests or defenses between them or (ii) the Indemnified Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the first sentence of
Section 9.4(c). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the
imposition of an Order that would materially restrict or otherwise materially
adversely affect the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) except to the extent
within the Deductible, any monetary Liability of the Indemnified Party that
will not be fully and promptly indemnified hereunder by the Indemnifying
Party, or (iv) such Indemnified Party not being completely and unconditionally
released from any and all Liabilities claimed in such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its election to so defend or otherwise, or (ii) after
assuming the defense of a

 



     

 

 



 

Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after
receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the
Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to,
but shall not be obligated to, assume such defense; _provided_ that the
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not
be adversely affected by assuming such defense. The Indemnified Party shall
not settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
reasonably in the defense of a Third Party Claim, including by providing
reasonable access to each others relevant information, business records and
other documents, and employees; _provided_ that any costs and expenses related
to the defense of a Third Party Claim incurred by the Indemnified Party shall
be counted as Losses.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause employees, counsel and others representing any
party to a Third Party Claim to avoid production or disclosure of information
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss or waiver of the
protection of any attorney-client privilege, attorney work product privilege
or other relevant legal privilege.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim
for indemnification hereunder for a Loss that does not result from a Third
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Direct Claim, the amount or the
estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Direct
Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints
relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details
pertaining thereto as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no more
than twenty (20) Business Days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of
circumstances indicating that the Indemnified Party has incurred or could
reasonably be expected to incur Losses in respect of which it is entitled to
indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure timely to
give notice of a Direct Claim pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall affect the
rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure
has a prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party rejects all or any part of the Direct Claim or fails to respond within
twenty (20) Business Days of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall be free
to seek enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this Agreement with
respect to such Direct Claim.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall act in good faith and
in a commercially reasonable manner to mitigate any Losses for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this Article IX upon and after
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such Losses; _provided_ , that the reasonable costs and expenses of such
mitigation shall be included in the

 



     

 

 



 

calculation of Losses subject to indemnification hereunder. The Parties agree
that the provisions of Section 254 German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches
Gesetzbuch - BGB_) shall not apply to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, following the Closing, other than with
respect to claims arising from Fraud, no Person shall be entitled to recover
from any Party, and Losses shall not include, any consequential, punitive,
special, incidental or indirect damages, including lost profits, loss of
future revenue or income, loss of business reputation or brand value,
diminution of value or any damages based on any type of business valuation
multiple, whether based on statute, contract, tort or otherwise, except as
reimbursement to the extent such damages are awarded by a court of competent
jurisdiction to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 



 

(a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this Article IX, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance
policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against
any other Person in each case relating to the Third Party Claim or the Direct
Claim, net of any actual costs, expenses, deductibles, co-payments or increase
premiums reasonably incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such
proceeds, shall be deducted, except to the extent that the adjustment itself
would excuse, exclude or limit the coverage of all or part of such Loss;
_provided_ that such Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to recover such proceeds under any such
insurance policy or pursuant to any such claim, recovery, settlement or
payment by or against any other Person. In the event that an Indemnified Party
has any rights against a third party with respect to any occurrence, claim or
loss that results in a payment by an Indemnifying Party under this Article IX,
such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to such rights to the extent of
such payment; _provided_ that until the Indemnified Party recovers full
payment of the Loss related to any such Direct Claim, any and all claims of
the Indemnifying Party against any such third party on account of said
indemnity payment are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right
of payment to the Indemnified Partys rights against such third party. Without
limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation and
subordination rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the
prosecution of such claims.

 



 

(b) _Cash Adjustment_. In calculating the amount of any Loss for which
Purchaser is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, the
amount of any such Loss that has been included in the calculation of the Cash
Consideration Amount pursuant to Section 2.10 shall be deducted.

 



 

(c) _Net Financial Benefit_. The amount of any and all Losses for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this Article IX shall be net of any
Tax Benefit to

 



     

 

 



 

which an Indemnified Party is entitled by reason of payment of such Loss
(taking into account any Tax cost or reduction in such Tax Benefits by reason
of receipt of the indemnification payment). Such Tax Benefits shall be
calculated based on the principles set forth in Section 7.1(b) unless such Tax
Benefit has already reduced an indemnity claim of Purchaser against Seller
Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or has been compensated by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7.4(a)(iii) or Section 7.4(a)(iv).

 



 

(d) _No Duplication_. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover more
than once in respect of the same Loss (notwithstanding that such Loss may
result from more than one of the matters described in Section 9.2 or Section
9.3, as the case may be).

 



 

Section 9.9 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified
Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss
for which it is liable hereunder no later than three (3) Business Days
following any final determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys
liability therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (a) the Parties
have reached an agreement in writing, or (b) a final and non-appealable Order
with respect to such Loss or any dispute in respect thereof has been entered.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy; No Recourse Against Non-Parties_.

 



 

(a) In case any of a breach by any of the Parties to comply with its
representations and warranties under this Agreement or a failure to comply
with any of the covenants and undertakings set forth herein, other than in
case of Fraud or willful misconduct ( _Vorsatz_ ), the claims set forth in
this Agreement shall be the Parties exclusive remedy and shall be exclusively
governed by the stipulations of this Agreement, and the Parties hereby exclude
and waive all other statutory, contractual, quasi-contractual or other claims,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, on the grounds of Sections 434 et seq.
of the German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch  BGB_) and agree that
the representations and warranties made herein shall not qualify as guarantees
( _Beschaffenheitsgarantien_ ) within the meaning of Sections 443 and 444 of
the German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch  BGB_), against the one
another and any of their current, former or future directors, managers,
officers, liquidators, employees, shareholders, agents and advisors, including
any right to issue a challenge ( _Anfechtung_ ) or withdrawal ( _R ucktritt_),
reduce the purchase price ( _Minderung_ ), or bring claims based on tort (
_Delikt_ ), breach of contractual and pre-contractual duties ( _positive
Forderungsverletzung, culpa in contrahendo_ ) and frustration of contract (
_St orung der Geschaftsgrundlage_), to the extent such liability may be
excluded pursuant to applicable Law. The statutory restrictions of Purchasers
claims under this Agreement, including those pursuant to Section 442 German
Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch - BGB_) and Section 377 German
Commercial Code ( _Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB_ ) shall not apply under any
circumstances (and for the avoidance of doubt, except for the matters
specifically disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule (subject to the
limitations set forth therein), no knowledge or potential knowledge of
Purchaser or any of its Representatives shall affect the rights of the
Purchaser hereunder). Following the Closing, neither Party shall

 



      

 

 



 

assert against the other Party any claim, cause of action, right or remedy
relating to this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions or any document or
instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, other than (i)
claims, causes of action, rights or remedies pursuant to this Article IX or
Article VII (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereof and
thereof), (ii) claims, causes of action, rights or remedies on the basis that
a Party has committed Fraud, (iii) claims, causes of action, rights or
remedies pursuant to Section 11.9 with respect to covenants to be performed at
or following the Closing and (iv) claims pursuant to the terms of any
Ancillary Agreement. Following the Closing, the claims, causes of action,
rights and remedies enumerated in the previous sentence shall constitute the
sole and exclusive claims, causes of action, rights and remedies available to
the Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions and any document
or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, and shall
supersede all other claims, causes of action, rights or remedies available at
law or in equity (including any right of rescission). Accordingly, effective
as of the Closing, each Party hereby irrevocably waives and discharges, and
releases each other Party, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, from, all other claims, causes of action, rights or remedies relating
thereto.

 



 

(b) In addition to the provisions set forth in Section 9.10(a), and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (but subject to the
final sentence of this Section 9.10(b)), this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claims or causes of action and Proceedings that may be based
on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be
made against, the Parties, and no former, current or future Affiliates,
directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants,
agents, Representatives or employees of any Party, or any Debt Financing
Sources (other than in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter) or any
heirs, successors or permitted assigns of any of the foregoing (each, a "
_Non-Party_ ") shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
such Party or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based
upon, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions or in respect of any representations and warranties made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of any
Party against the other Party, in no event shall any Party or any of its
Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement, or assert any claims or causes of
action based on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, against any Non-Party, in each case subject to the final
sentence of this Section 9.10(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 9.10(b) shall preclude any party to any Ancillary Agreement or
the Confidentiality Agreement, from making any claim thereunder, to the extent
permitted therein.

intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d);
_provided_ , that Seller Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d) if there has been a breach by
Seller Parent of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth

have become untrue, in each case such that any condition set forth in Section
8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) would not be satisfied; or

 



 

(e) by Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller Parent, if there shall

 



     

 

 



 

have been a breach by Seller Parent of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty
of Seller Parent set forth in this Agreement shall have become untrue, in each
case such that any condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b)

pursuant to this Section 10.1(e) if there has been a breach by Purchaser of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser shall have become
untrue, in each case such that any condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) or
Section 8.3(b) would not be satisfied.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no effect, and no Party shall have any liability to the
other Party or their respective Affiliates, or their respective directors,
officers or employees, except for the obligations of the Parties contained in
this Section 10.2 and in Section 5.4(c), Section 5.13, Section 11.1, Section
11.3, Section 11.4, Section 11.6, Section 11.8, Section 11.10, Section 11.14

Party to receive such notice provided above. Any notice, request, instruction
or other communications or document given as provided above shall be deemed
given to the receiving party (x) upon actual receipt, if delivered personally,
(y) on the second (2nd) Business Day after deposit with an overnight courier,
if sent by an overnight courier, or (z) upon confirmation of successful
transmission if sent by email and followed up within one (1) Business Day by
dispatch pursuant to one of the other methods described herein. Copies to
outside counsel are for convenience only and failure to provide a copy to
outside counsel does not alter the effectiveness of any notice, request,
instruction or other communication otherwise given in accordance with this
Section 11.1.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Subject to Section 11.15, any provision of
this Agreement (including this Section 11.2) may be amended or waived if and
only if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each Party, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against
whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law except as
otherwise specifically provided in Article IX hereof.

 



 

Section 11.3 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Subject to the
provisions of Section 2.14, no Party may assign any of its rights or delegate
any of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that (i) either
Party may assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement to one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries (but no
such assignment shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder
or thereunder); (ii) subject to Section 11.3(b), Seller Parent may transfer or
retain its rights and obligations as a Holder under Annex 27 (in whole or in
part) with respect to any Registrable Securities to any transferee who is a
Holder (and any transferee may transfer or retain such rights and obligations
with respect to any Registrable Securities to any subsequent transferee who is
a Holder) without the prior written consent of Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the transferee shall have agreed to be bound by the
applicable terms of Annex 27 with respect to such Registrable Securities; and
(iii) any obligation of any Party to any other Party under this Agreement, or
any of the Ancillary Agreements, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have
been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party. Any

 



     

 

 



 

attempted assignment or delegation of this Agreement not effected in
accordance with this Section 11.3 shall be null and void.

 



 

(b) Any assignment to a transferee of Registrable Securities pursuant to
Section 11.3(a) shall be effective upon receipt by Purchaser of written notice
from the transferring Holder stating the name and address of any transferee
and identifying the number of shares of Registrable Securities with respect to
which the rights under this Agreement are being transferred together with such
Registrable Securities and the nature of the rights so transferred.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 11.15, each Party hereby agrees that their respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any
Person other than the Parties and such successors and permitted assigns any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Affiliates of each Party and its and their respective directors, officers,
shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,
Representatives and employees and their heirs, successors and permitted
assigns, shall be third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely
on, Section 9.10 ( _Sole and Exclusive Remedy; No Recourse Against Non-
Parties_ ) and the Affiliates of each Party which are parties to any Local
Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of, and entitled to rely on,
Section 5.9(b) ( _Local Agreements_ ).

 



 

Section 11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(in each case, together with the annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto)
collectively contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect until
the Closing and is hereby amended accordingly. No Party shall be bound by, or
be liable for, any alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of
intention not contained herein or therein. The Parties expressly disclaim
reliance on any information, statements, representations or warranties made by
any Party regarding the subject matter of this Agreement other than the terms
of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of any Ancillary Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall prevail. Neither Party shall, or permit its respective
Affiliates to, enforce or attempt to enforce, or otherwise use or introduce
into evidence, the "entire agreement" clause in any Ancillary Agreement in any
manner which could challenge, question or impair the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or, in each case,
any terms hereof or thereof.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Payments_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, any payment to be made by one Party to the other Party in
connection with this Agreement shall be made in Euro.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement, whether or not the Closing occurs, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement shall be borne by the Party incurring such
costs and expenses.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Bulk Sales_. Each Party hereby waives compliance with any
applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in which any of
the Transferred Assets are located to the extent that such Law is applicable
to the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum;
Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 11.15, this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the Federal Republic of Germany
excluding its conflict of laws provisions and excluding the UN Convention on
the International Sale of Goods (CISG).

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 11.15, any controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof,
shall be settled by arbitration administered by the International Chamber of
Commerce in accordance with its Rules of Arbitration excluding any Expedited
Procedure Provisions (as defined in the Rules of Arbitration), which shall not
apply. The number of arbitrators shall be three, one of whom shall be
appointed by each of the Parties and the third of whom, who shall act as
chairperson, shall be selected by mutual agreement of the co-arbitrators, if
possible, within thirty (30) days of the selection of the second arbitrator
and thereafter by the administering authority and the place of arbitration
shall be Paris, France. The language of the arbitration shall be English and
the award shall be rendered in English, but documents or testimony may be
submitted in another language if a translation is provided. The arbitration
award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on the Parties.
The arbitrator(s) may make an award of the costs of the arbitration, including
any legal fees. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. Except as may be required by law, neither a Party nor
its representatives nor a witness nor an arbitrator may disclose the
existence, contents or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
written consent of both Parties, except to the extent necessary to the conduct
of the arbitration or permitted court proceedings, or as required by law
(including securities laws). Each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that service
of all pleadings or process in connection with any proceedings, wherever
brought, for the recognition and enforcement of any award resulting from an
arbitration brought pursuant to this Section 11.8(b), or any judgment, of any
jurisdiction, resulting therefrom may be made in accordance with Section 11.1.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding any of the
indemnification obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the rights of each Party to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions are unique and of extraordinary character and that
if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and
irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which money

 



     

 

 



 

damages would not be an adequate remedy. The Parties therefore agree that, in
addition to any other remedies, each Party shall be entitled to enforce the
terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. The preceding sentence
shall also apply in the event the Agreement contains any unintended gaps (
_Regelungsl ucken_). Section 139 German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch
 BGB_) shall not apply to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations_. Purchaser
hereby waives, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Entities after Closing) to waive, and shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities after Closing) not to, assert
any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation,
after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Share Sellers
any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their respective officers,
employees or directors (any such person or entity, a " _Designated Person_ ")
in any matter involving this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
Contemplated Transactions, by any legal counsel, including Sullivan and Cromwell
LLP (" _Prior Company Counsel_ "), currently representing any Designated
Person in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
Contemplated Transactions (the " _Current Representation_ "). Without limiting
the foregoing, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities following the Closing) agrees that, following the
Closing, Prior Company Counsel may serve as counsel to any Designated Person
in connection with any matters related to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Contemplated Transactions, including any litigation, claim
or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or the Contemplated Transactions notwithstanding any representation
by Prior Company Counsel prior to the Closing, and Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities following the
Closing), hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Purchaser or any Transferred Entity, on the one hand, and any
Designated Person, on the other hand, Prior Company Counsel may represent one
or more Designated Persons in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Purchaser or any Transferred Entity and
even though Prior Company Counsel may have represented a Transferred Entity in
a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Non-Assertion of Attorney-Client Privilege_. Purchaser hereby
waives, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities
following

 



     

 

 



 

the Closing) to waive, and shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities following the Closing) not to, assert any
attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between any Prior
Company Counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including
in connection with a dispute between any Designated Person and one or more of
Purchaser, the Transferred Entities and their respective Affiliates, it being
the intention of the Parties that all rights to such attorney-client privilege
and to control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Share
Sellers. Furthermore, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any advice given
to or communication with any of the Designated Persons with respect to the
Current Representation shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall
be owned solely by the applicable Share Seller. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, the portion of the
Books and Records of the Transferred Entities containing any such privileged
communications shall be excluded from the Transaction, and shall be
distributed to the applicable Share Sellers (on behalf of the applicable
Designated Persons) immediately prior to the Closing with no copies retained
by the Transferred Entities. If any such communications are thereafter
discovered in the Books and Records of the Transferred Entities, they shall be
promptly tendered to the Share Sellers, without retaining copies, and
Purchaser agrees (including on behalf of its Affiliates) that any applicable
privilege shall remain intact notwithstanding. Purchaser hereby acknowledges
that it has had the opportunity (including on behalf of its Affiliates) to
discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and
material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers,
permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity
to consult with counsel other than Prior Company Counsel. This Section 11.12
shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 11.12 may be amended, waived
or modified, without the prior written consent of Share Sellers and their
Affiliates and Prior Company Counsel affected thereby.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary or an Affiliate of a Party to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of such Party to cause
such Subsidiary or Affiliate to take such action.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.15 _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, but in all cases subject to and without in any way
limiting the rights and claims of Purchaser or its Affiliates under and
pursuant to any Debt Commitment Letter or the rights of Seller Parent to seek
specific performance of the obligations of Purchaser hereunder, including
under Section 11.9, or for Seller Parent to otherwise enforce its rights
hereunder, each Party hereby:

 



 

(a) agrees that any Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Sources, in any
way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Debt Commitment Letter
or any of the

 



     

 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and shall be
brought and heard and determined exclusively in, the Federal and New York
State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York;

 



 

(b) agrees that any such Proceeding contemplated by Section 11.15(a) shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
conflicts of Law principles of such state that would apply the Laws of another
jurisdiction, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Debt Commitment
Letter;

 



 

(c) agrees not to bring, or support any person to bring, or permit any of its
