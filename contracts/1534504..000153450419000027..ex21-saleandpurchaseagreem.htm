respective locations of the Refinery Hydrocarbon Inventory on the Closing

Report") to both Buyer and Seller within ten (10) Business Days after the
Closing Date setting forth the volumes, quantities, locations, types and all
relevant qualities (as specified in Schedule 1.01A) of the Refinery
Hydrocarbon Inventory as of the Effective Time. The fees and expenses of the
Field Inspector shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent
(50%) by Buyer.



(e)As soon as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) days
following receipt of the Field Inspector Report, Seller shall cause to be

necessary supporting calculations and detailed information (the "Inventory
Statement") setting forth the volume, locations, type and qualities of the
Refinery Hydrocarbon Inventory as measured by the Field Inspector and

receipt of the Inventory Statement and Inventory Value (the date of Seller's
receipt of such acceptance or rejection, or the expiration of such 30 day
period with no notice having been given, shall be the "Inventory Notice
Date"). If Buyer fails to give such notice before the end of such thirty (30)

deemed final and binding upon the Parties. If Buyer gives such notice to
Seller of Buyer's objection within such thirty (30) days, and Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve the issues in dispute within thirty (30) days after
delivery of such notice of objection, each of Buyer's and Seller's positions
with respect to the computation of the Inventory Value will be submitted to an
independent and qualified party mutually selected by the Parties (the
"Inspector") such as an accounting firm or independent inspector, for final
resolution. If the computation of the Inventory Value is submitted to the
Inspector for resolution, (x) each Party will furnish to the Inspector such
work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed
issues as the Inspector may request and are available to that Party and will
be afforded the opportunity to present to the Inspector any materials relating
to such issues and to discuss the same with the Inspector; (y) the Inspector's
determination or computation of the Inventory Value shall be binding and
conclusive on the Parties and will be deemed to be the final Inventory Value
(and judgment thereupon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over
the Party against which the same is sought to be enforced); and (z) the fees
and expenses of the Inspector for such determination will be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.



(f)If the sum of the Inventory Value minus the Inventory Deposit (the
"Inventory Balance") is greater than zero, then Buyer shall pay to Seller,
without offset or deduction, an amount equal to the Inventory Balance by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts of Seller,
as may be designated by Seller. If the amount of the Inventory Balance is less
than zero, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, without offset or deduction, an
amount equal to such deficit by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account or accounts of Buyer, as may be designated by Buyer. All such
undisputed amounts shall be paid by the relevant Party to the other Party
within ten (10) days of the Inventory Notice Date. All disputed amounts shall
be paid by the relevant Party to the other Party within ten (10) Business Days
of the resolution of such disputed amounts. All amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.08(f) (both disputed and undisputed amounts) shall bear
interest from and including the

a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus one percent (1%), not to exceed the
maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law. Such interest shall be payable at
the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on
the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days for which due.



(g)Each Party agrees that, both before and following the Closing, it shall not
take any actions with respect to the accounting books, records, policies and
procedures of itself or its Affiliates that would obstruct or prevent the
preparation of the Inventory Statement as provided in Section 2.08. From the
Closing through the final determination of the Inventory Value in accordance
with Section 2.08, (i) Seller shall provide Buyer with access at all
reasonable times to the personnel and working papers utilized in determining
the Inventory Statement for purposes of confirming Seller's calculation of
same and (ii) Seller and Buyer shall provide one another access at all
reasonable times to the personnel, properties, and books and records of the
Refinery for purposes of determining the Inventory Value, including permitting
the Parties and their respective advisors to participate in the taking of the
physical inventory. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Inventory Statement, if requested by the other Party.



(h)Except as expressly set forth in this Section 2.08, Buyer and Seller shall
each bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and
review of the Inventory Statement.



2.09 Closing Adjustments. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller (or
Seller's designee), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by Seller, an amount (the "Closing Date Payment") equal to
the Base Amount, as adjusted by the following:

2.08(a);

WARRANTIES IN ARTICLE IV (INCLUDING THE RELATED PORTIONS OF THE DISCLOSURE
LETTER) AND THE OTHER CLOSING DOCUMENTS, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE assets
(including the operation of the assets) and assumed liabilities are sold TO
and ASSUMED AND accepted BY Buyer "as is, where is" and "with all faults", in

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF SELLER



Seller covenants and agrees as follows:

6.01 Access and Information.



(a)Subject to the provisions of Section 18.15 and upon reasonable notice,
Seller shall grant, or cause to be granted, to Buyer and its Representatives
access during normal business hours throughout the Interim Period to the
Refinery Books and Records and other information relating to the Operations of
the Assets (subject to any confidentiality agreements, applicable legal
restrictions and any applicable legal privileges). During the Interim Period,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish, or cause to be
furnished, to Buyer and its Representatives all data and information
concerning the Assets and concerning Operations of the Assets that may
reasonably be requested by Buyer and shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to make available, or cause to be made available, such personnel of
the Seller Companies as may reasonably be requested. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentences to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to permit Buyer or its Representatives to have access to, and the
Refinery Books and Records shall not include, any files, records, contracts or
documents of the Seller Companies or their respective Affiliates relating to
(a) a Seller Company's or its Affiliate's inter-company or intra-company
feedstock and product pricing information, internal transfer prices, hedging
activity records and internal hydrocarbon inventory valuation procedures and
records or (b) the negotiation or execution of this Agreement.



(b)From and after the Effective Time, Seller will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, afford to Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice (and under such
commercially reasonable conditions as Seller may request and to avoid
interference with the normal conduct of its business), to personnel and to
such properties and records that were not transferred to Buyer and, if
requested, will furnish to Buyer such additional information (at Buyer's
expense, to the extent provision of such data has accompanying external cost
to Seller, and as reasonably feasible, to the extent the provision of such
data requires extrapolation from applications/electronic storage or licenses
from third parties) and reasonably cooperate with Buyer in such other
respects, including the making of employees available to Buyer at Buyer's
expense as witnesses or deponents as Buyer may reasonably request that are
necessary for (i) reporting, disclosure, filing, or other requirements imposed
on Buyer (including under applicable securities laws) by a Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over Buyer, (ii) tax or similar audit,
accounting, regulatory or similar purposes, (iii) purposes of investigating
claims, or conducting litigation or administrative proceedings with third
parties or Governmental Authorities or (iv) as necessary for Buyer to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement; provided that (x) Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless (subject to
Article XIII) for all Losses to the extent caused by, arising from or related
to the acts or omissions of Buyer and its Representatives from such access,
(y) to the extent that Seller considers any of the information to be provided
to Buyer confidential or proprietary, then Seller and Buyer shall enter into a
customary confidentiality agreement for protection of such information, and
(z) for the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be entitled to exclude or redact
any information from that to be provided to Buyer pursuant to this clause to
the extent such information is unrelated to the Assets, relates to the
negotiation of this Agreement, or is covered by one of the exclusions in the
definition of "Refinery Books and Records". Seller will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, keep and maintain the records to which Buyer or its
representatives may request access pursuant to this Section 6.01(b), such
records to be maintained for a period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date
in the case of environmental records and five (5) years for all other records



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 42 of 92

* * *



or such longer period as may be required of Seller by Applicable Laws or HSE
Laws, provided that if Seller desires to destroy or dispose of such records
during such period Seller will first offer in writing at least sixty (60) days
before such destruction or disposition to surrender them to Buyer and if Buyer
does not accept such offer within twenty (20) days after receipt of such
offer, then Seller may take such action. No access or review of such records
by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.01(b) or otherwise shall affect the
Seller's representations and warranties pursuant to this Agreement or the
remedies of Buyer for breaches of the representations and warranties. In the
event Seller determines in its good faith opinion that any such provision of
access, information or cooperation described above would reasonably be
expected to violate any Applicable Law or contract or result in the forfeiture
or waiver of any attorney-client privilege, Seller and Buyer shall take all
commercially reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such
obligations in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to result in
such harm or consequence but Seller will not be required to provide any such
access, information or cooperation that would violate any Applicable Law or
contract or waive or forfeit any such privilege.



6.02 Conduct of Business.



(a)During the Interim Period, Seller shall conduct (and shall cause the Seller
Companies to conduct) the Operations of the Assets in the Ordinary Course of
Business consistent with the applicable Seller Company's customary practices
including turnarounds, routine maintenance and routine preventive maintenance
activities, and capital expenditures and projects as are in the applicable
Seller Company's operational plans for such period. Seller shall (and shall
cause the Seller Companies to) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
satisfactory relationships with Employees, suppliers, distributors, customers,
collective bargaining units and others having business relationships with the
Assets, including using their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) renew,
extend or otherwise modify any Refinery Contracts to be assumed by Buyer
scheduled to expire during the Interim Period in consultation with Buyer (to
the extent allowed by Applicable Law) on terms and conditions that are
commercially practicable, and (ii) to include in such Refinery Contracts an
assignment clause that will allow the assignment to Buyer.

(b)Without limiting the generality of Section 6.02(a), Seller shall not (and
shall cause the Seller Companies not to) during the Interim Period, without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed,



(i)sell, lease, mortgage, transfer or convey, exclusively license to others or
otherwise dispose of a material portion of any assets that would constitute
Assets if held as of the Effective Time, except for Refinery Hydrocarbon
Inventory and Refinery Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory purchased or sold in the
Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past practice, or acquire any
asset other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, consistent with past
practice, which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to be material to the financial condition or operation of the Assets
taken as a whole;

(ii)except for promotions and annual consideration for increases in base
salary and bonus pay consistent with past practice, make any material change
in the rate of compensation, commission, bonus or other direct or indirect
remuneration payable, or paid or agreed or orally promised to pay,
conditionally or otherwise, any bonus, incentive, retention or other
compensation, retirement, welfare, fringe or severance benefit or vacation
pay, to or in respect of any Employee or adopt any new employee benefits plan
or employee profit sharing plan, or make any change to the rules of any
benefits in effect but excluding retention and related bonuses paid or payable
by the applicable Seller Company in connection with the transition activities
contemplated herein and except for the case whereby a Seller



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 43 of 92

* * *



Company, in the Ordinary Course of Business, amends, waives or terminates an
Employee Benefit Plan for such Seller Company's US employee population in any
manner which does not increase the benefits provided thereunder, in which case
Seller will inform Buyer within thirty (30) days of such planned change to
such Employee Benefit Plan;



(iii)enter into any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding, or
enter into any amendment of any existing settlement agreement, where the
provisions thereof will materially and adversely impact the Assets or the
ordinary Operations of the Assets as currently conducted by the Seller
Companies (Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable prior notice in the
event a Seller Company enters into any settlement of any pending or threatened
litigation related to the Assets);



(iv)consent to the entry of (or amendment to) any decree or order by, or enter
into (or amend) any other agreements with, any Government Authority that will
materially adversely affect the Assets or the ordinary Operations of the
Assets as currently conducted by the Seller Companies;



(v)enter into any material commitment for capital expenditure or authorize any
material capital expenditure with respect to the Assets or make any material
commitment for the purchase, construction or improvement of the Assets except
in the Ordinary Course of Business or related to any turnaround or maintenance
of the Assets; or



(vi)waive or relinquish any material right under any Refinery Contracts,
Permits, HSE permits, Real Property Leases or Easements that are included in
the Assets;

(vii)commit to any of the foregoing.



(c)Without limiting the generality of Section 6.02(a), Seller shall notify
Buyer if it should enter into any new Material Contract that will survive the
Closing provided that Buyer shall have no obligation to assume at Closing any
such Material Contract that is a Refinery Contract unless (i) it relates to a
turnaround or maintenance of the Assets, (ii) it involves payment on an annual
basis of less than $2,000,000, or (iii) such Contract would otherwise not
materially and adversely affect Buyer's ownership or operation of the Refinery
from and after the Closing.



(d)Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyer acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that nothing in this
Section 6.02 shall be construed to restrict or limit the Seller Companies' or
their respective Affiliates' ability to conduct their own business and operate
the Assets as determined by the Seller Companies and their respective
Affiliates in their sole and absolute discretion, including (i) to effect,
prior to the Closing Date, the transfer of any Excluded Assets, (ii) to effect
the Contemplated Transactions, and (iii) to undertake and complete any
turnarounds or maintenance (scheduled or unscheduled) of the Refinery.



6.03 Disclosure Letter.



(a)Seller may from time to time prior to the Closing, by written notice to
Buyer, supplement or amend the Disclosure Letter (including adding new
Sections to the Disclosure Letter related to provisions of this Agreement that
currently do not contemplate qualification by the Disclosure Letter) with new
or updated information with respect to matters that occur or arise after the
Execution Date to correct any matter that would constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller in Article IV as of the Closing Date
(such new or additional information being "New Seller Information"). For
purposes herein "New Seller Information" shall include any Material Contract
entered into that Buyer does not have to assume pursuant to Section 6.02(c)



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 44 of 92

* * *



and shall not include information that is updated in the Ordinary Course of
Business during the Interim Period (e.g., updated lists of Employees) and is
provided to Buyer prior to the Closing.



(b)For purposes of determining whether Buyer's conditions set forth in Section
11.02 have been fulfilled, the Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to exclude
the New Seller Information.



(c)If Buyer has a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
16.01(b) as a result of the conditions set forth in Section 11.02 not being
satisfied but Buyer elects to proceed with the Closing and the Closing does
occur, then the New Seller Information shall be deemed to be accepted by Buyer
and Buyer shall be deemed to have waived and not be entitled to make a Claim
thereon under this Agreement (including pursuant to Article XIII) or
otherwise. If, however, Buyer does not have such a right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 16.01(b) as a result of the conditions set forth
in Section 11.02 being satisfied and the Closing does occur, then the New
Seller Information shall not be deemed to be accepted or waived by Buyer, and
Buyer shall be entitled to make a Claim thereon under this Agreement
(including pursuant to Article XIII) or otherwise.



6.04 Cooperation with Respect to Financial Statements. At Buyer's sole cost
and expense, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer
and its Representatives the following historical financial statements for the
Refinery (the "Refinery Financial Statements"): (a) the 2016, 2017, and 2018
full fiscal year periods (audited) within thirty (30) days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and shall use commercial
reasonable efforts to deliver such financial statements to Buyer for its
comment and review in a timely manner in advance of that deadline with a
target date for delivery of sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, (b) the latest fiscal year interim period financial statements
(unaudited) for the completed interim period requested by Buyer within forty
(40) days subsequent to the date of such request by Buyer, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such financial statements to Buyer
for its comment and review in a timely manner in advance of that deadline with
a target date for delivery of thirty (30) days after the date of such request,
(c) any additional audited annual fiscal year periods or unaudited interim
periods for prior periods should Buyer's auditors determine that such
additional periods would be required in order to comply with Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X ("Rule 3-05") of the Securities Act of 1993, as amended, or be
otherwise required by the Buyer, and shall use commercial reasonable efforts
to deliver such statements in a timely manner with a target date for delivery
of sixty (60) days after the date requested by Buyer, and (d) the latest
fiscal year interim period financial statements as required by Rule 3-05 on a
comparative basis to the same interim period of the prior year, or be
otherwise required by the Buyer, and use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver such financial statements to Buyer for its comment and review no less
than fifteen (15) days prior to the deadline stipulated by Rule 3-05 (and in
any event no later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date). The
obligations of Seller to disclose or provide reasonable access to any
historical financial information shall terminate six (6) months after the
Closing Date. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for its and its Affiliates'
reasonable internal costs and out-of-pocket costs associated with this Section
6.04. Buyer agrees that it shall consult with Seller in advance of requesting
any such documents with a view towards establishing a mutually agreeable plan
that shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of Seller and
its Affiliates. In addition, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
prepare a historical balance sheet and income statement for the Refinery for
the interim period beginning the first day of the fiscal quarter in which the
Closing Date occurs through the Closing Date and deliver them to Buyer no less
than 30 days after the Closing Date, provided such financial statements need
not be audited, adjusted, or reviewed by an independent auditor.



6.05 Notification. From the Execution Date through and including the Closing
Date, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if Seller obtains Knowledge that any
representation or warranty of Buyer



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 45 of 92

* * *



in the Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby or information set forth
in the Schedules or the Disclosure Letter is not true and correct in all
material respects, or if Seller obtains Knowledge of any material errors in,
or omissions from, the Schedules or the Disclosure Letter.

(a) During the Interim Period, Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller
Companies to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to identify (i) all

Easements and Permits that may exist in respect of such pipelines and utility
lines related to the Operation and/or ownership of the Refinery, and (v) where
the custody transfer and/or metering points are for such pipelines and utility
lines in relation to the Refinery.

(b) During the Interim Period, to the extent Seller identifies pursuant to
Section 6.06(a) that:

(i) the information on Schedule 2.01(a)(2) or Schedule 2.02(a)(xiv) is not
accurate, such that a pipeline needs to be added or removed from either such
schedule;

(ii) any new Refinery Contracts (such as an operating agreement for a
pipeline) should be listed on Schedule 2.01(f);

(iii) any Contract previously listed as a Refinery Contract should instead be
listed on Schedule 2.02(a)(v) as an Excluded Contract;

(iv) any new Refinery Permits (such as an operating agreement for a pipeline)
should be listed on Schedule 2.01(g); or

(vi) the information on Schedule 1.01E is not accurate, such that information

discretion, to Buyer, supplement or amend any such schedule.

(c) During the Interim Period, Representatives of Seller shall keep Buyer
apprised of the status of Seller's investigations conducted pursuant to
Section 6.06(a) and any information disclosed by Seller pursuant to Section

Section 11.11, the information resulting from investigations conducted
pursuant to Section 6.06(a) and/or disclosed by Seller pursuant to Section
6.06(b) shall constitute New Seller Information under Section 6.03(a), shall
be excluded for the purposes set forth in Section 6.03(b) and subject to the
provisions of Section 6.03(c).

(d) If it is identified pursuant to Section 6.06(a) that a pipeline listed on
Schedule 2.01(a)(2) is operated by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller from a
control center located outside of the Refinery, then Buyer may request that
Seller provide Buyer with transition control center services for a term not to
exceed one (1) year and, at Closing, the Parties shall enter into a Transition
Services Agreement based on the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit J
with a services schedule for such services as is typical to provide for
transition of such control center operations from a seller to a buyer for
transactions of this sort. Seller shall be entitled to recover from Buyer, as
a services fee, Seller's (or its Affiliates') actual cost of providing such
control center services.

activities pursuant to this Section 7.04 at the Refinery, the other Assets or
the Operations and shall indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer Indemnified
Parties harmless for all Losses to the extent caused by, arising from or
related to the acts or omissions of Seller and its Representatives in
conducting any such activities.



7.05 Litigation. With respect to all litigation and other matters set forth in
the Disclosure Letter and any other matters that constitute Retained
Liabilities and for so long as a Seller Company is contesting or defending
such matter, Buyer shall cooperate to the extent commercially reasonable with
such Seller Company and its Affiliates and their respective counsel, at such
Seller Company's expense, in their efforts to conduct or resolve such
litigation, including by making available to them such documents and witnesses
as may be deemed necessary or useful therefor.



7.06 Trademarks. No license to any of the Trademarks is granted to Buyer by
this Agreement, the Closing Documents, or by the transfer of the Assets to
Buyer, and Buyer is precluded from any use and agrees not to make any use of
Trademarks on or in connection with the sale of any of its products or
services as a means of identity or in any of its communications or in
connection with Buyer's operation of the Assets. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
with Seller that the Trademarks, and all rights to which and the goodwill
represented thereby and pertaining thereto, are being retained by the Seller
Companies and their respective Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of
the preceding, Buyer will not be entitled to use the name "Shell" or any
variations or derivations thereof (including any logo, trademark or design
containing such name) or any logo, service mark, trade name or trademark that
constitutes an Excluded Asset. Accordingly, as soon as reasonably practical
after the Closing, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date with regards to Assets that are visible to the public, and within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date with regards to Assets that
are not visible to the general public, Buyer shall remove from, or paint or
cover over as appropriate, any logo, service mark, trade name or trademark
indicating that such assets were owned or operated by a Seller Company or any
of its Affiliates (including signs displaying such Seller Company's or its
Affiliates' emergency contact telephone number(s) or otherwise using or
displaying the name "Shell", in whole or in part). As promptly as practicable
after the Closing but in any event within ten (10) days, Buyer shall post
Buyer's emergency contact telephone number in place of any Seller Company's or
its Affiliates' emergency contact telephone number(s). In the event that Buyer
breaches this Section 7.06, Seller shall

be entitled to specific performance of this Section 7.06 and to injunctive
relief against further violations, as well as any other remedies at law or in
equity available to Seller.



7.07 Third Party Property. Buyer shall grant or continue to grant such rights
of ingress or egress necessary to allow any third party that holds any Third
Party Property to have access to such Third Party Property for the purposes of
repairing, maintaining or otherwise utilizing such property, for so long as
the Third Party Property lawfully remains on the Real Property.



7.08 Credit Support Arrangements.



(a)Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to the applicable beneficiary or
counterparty replacement or substitute guaranties, letters of credit, bonds,
security deposits, and other surety obligations and evidence of financial
capacity, in each case acceptable to the relevant beneficiary or counterparty,
in substitution and replacement of those credit support arrangements set forth
in Schedule 7.08 (the "Credit Support Arrangements"), in form and substance
acceptable to Seller, and shall cause the release as of the Closing of the
Seller Companies and their Affiliates from all Obligations relating to the
Credit Support Arrangements.



(b)Buyer acknowledges and accepts that from and after the Closing Date, Seller
may revoke (or have the Assets removed from the scope of) any Credit Support
Arrangements.



(c)To the extent that a Credit Support Arrangement has not been replaced or

the scope of) any Credit Support Arrangements as contemplated by Section
7.08(b), Buyer shall have a continuing obligation after the Closing to use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such Credit Support Arrangement replaced
or substituted by Buyer thereof as contemplated by ýSection 7.08(a).



(d)From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller Indemnitee against any Claims and Losses that any Seller Indemnitee
suffers, incurs or is liable for by reason of or arising out of or in
consequence of (i) any Seller Indemnitee making payment under or being
required to pay or reimburse the issuer of any Credit Support Arrangement,
(ii) any claim or demand for payment made on any Seller Indemnitee with
respect to any of the Credit Support Arrangement or (iii) any action, Claim or
Proceeding by any Person who is or claims to be entitled to the benefit or
claims to be entitled to payment, reimbursement or indemnity with respect to
any Credit Support Arrangement.



(e)The provisions of this Section 7.08 shall survive the Closing.

consummate the Contemplated Transactions is not conditioned upon any financing
being made available to Buyer.



7.10 One-Call; Utilities.



(a)Buyer will promptly after the Closing, but in no event later than thirty
(30) days following the expiration or termination of the Transition Services
Agreement (to the extent it applies), contact every appropriate one-call
agency in the vicinity of the Refinery and have the contact information for

(b)Buyer will promptly after the Closing, but in any event no later than
thirty (30) calendar days following the expiration or termination of the
Transition Services Agreement (to the extent it applies), contact the utility

to Buyer's name. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller that all such notices have
been provided to the applicable utility providers. Buyer shall bear the costs
associated with any new utility connections or meters that may be required for
Buyer\'s assumption of utility services.



7.11 Notification of Transfer of Equity Interests.



(a)Buyer shall notify Seller if at any time prior to the Closing Date:



i.Equity Interests representing 5% or more of the fully-diluted Equity
Interests of the Buyer (or any Affiliate of the Buyer that is a party to a
Closing Document) have been sold, transferred, assigned, conveyed, exchanged
or otherwise disposed of to any Person; or



ii.Equity Interests of an Affiliate of Buyer have been sold, transferred,
assigned, conveyed, exchanged or otherwise disposed of that represent 5% or
more of such Person and such Person, directly or indirectly, holds 5% or more
of the fully-diluted Equity Interests of Buyer (or any Affiliate of the Buyer
that is a party to a Closing Document);



provided, however, that in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), as it

only be required to disclose information that is available to it from a review
of Schedule 13G and 13D filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(b)Should either of the actions occur as described in Section 7.11(a), then

limiting information required as it relates to PBF Energy Inc.) as Seller
shall request as is necessary for Seller to complete its required integrity
due diligence screening on the Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer (as
applicable). Seller shall complete its integrity due diligence within ten (10)
Business Days of the provision of such information and shall promptly notify
Buyer in the event that Seller believes the condition set forth in Section
12.06 will not be satisfied.



7.12 Pipeline Easement.



(a)For two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, at Seller's request
Buyer shall either (selection of which being in Buyer's discretion) (x)
itself, at Seller's cost and with Seller's cooperation, undertake to or (y)
grant Seller (or Seller's Representatives) access over and across the Real
Property to, plat, map and record the existing locations and pipeline slots
occupied by the Excluded Pipelines for purposes of Buyer granting to Seller
(or the owner of such pipeline identified by Seller) easements for such
pipelines, which easements Buyer hereby agrees to grant in accordance with
Section 7.12(b); provided, however, that if Buyer grants Seller access in
accordance with clause (y) above Seller bears the risk of any injury to
Seller's Representatives during any such activities at the Refinery and shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless for all
Losses to the extent caused by, arising from or related to the acts or
omissions of Seller and its Representatives in conducting any such activities.



(b)Each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in
good faith and agree the terms of the easements to be granted pursuant to
Section 7.12(a) (the "Pipeline Easement"), which the Parties agree shall be
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 50 of 92

* * *



K, and to cooperate with the other Party, to do such things, perform such acts
and to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver such documents, agreements and
instruments as may be reasonably necessary to grant of the Pipeline Easements.



(c)Buyer shall have the right to designate a reasonable course through which
Seller must follow over and across the Real Property to access the Real
Property for purposes of enacting Section 7.12(a) above.



(d)For a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of (i)
the date that Buyer and Seller agree easements for such Excluded Pipelines
pursuant to Section 7.12(b) above, or (ii) two (2) years after the Closing
Date ("Easement Term"), Buyer hereby grants to Seller a non-exclusive easement
for the Excluded Pipelines over and across the Real Property only to the
extent necessary for, the operation and maintenance of the Excluded Pipelines
as reasonably determined by Buyer (the "Easement Area") and solely for the
purposes of the operation and maintenance of the Excluded Pipelines. Buyer
expressly reserves for itself, its successors and its assigns, the right to
use the Easement Area or to grant other easements or licenses at the same
location so long as such use/uses does/do not unreasonably interfere with the
rights herein granted. The easement under this Section 7.12(d) is subject to
all liens, encumbrances, covenants, conditions, restrictions, reservations,
contracts, leases and licenses, easements, and rights of way pertaining to the
Real Property, whether or not of record. The use of the word "grant" shall not
imply any warranty on the part of Buyer with respect to the easement or the
Easement Area. Seller shall comply with all Applicable Laws, including but not
limited to all applicable regulatory, environmental and safety requirements at
Seller's sole cost and expense. Seller shall not use, deposit or permit the
use or deposit of any Hazardous Substances on the Real Property or on any
other real property adjacent to the Easement Area. Buyer may revoke the
Easement if in the opinion of Buyer it unreasonably interferes with the
present or future use by Buyer of the Real Property. Seller shall not
materially interfere with the use by and operation and activities of Buyer on
its property, and Seller shall use such routes and follow such procedures on
Buyer's property as result in the least damage and inconvenience to Buyer.
Seller shall be responsible for any damage to Buyer's property or that of
third parties resulting from any exercise of the rights herein granted,
including but not limited to soil erosion, subsidence or damage resulting
therefrom. Seller shall promptly repair and restore to its original condition
any of Buyer's property, including, but not limited to, roads, utilities,
buildings and fences that may be altered, damaged or destroyed in connection
with the exercise of the easement or use of the Easement Area. This grant of
easement is made on the express condition that Buyer is to be free from all
liability by reason of injury or death to persons or injury to property from
whatever cause arising out of Seller's, its contractors', agents', officers',
members', employees', invitees', or licensees' exercise of rights granted
pursuant to this easement or use of the Easement Area or of the improvements
or personal property of Seller thereto or thereon, including any liability for
injury or death to the person or property of Seller, its contractors, agents,
officers, members, employees, invitees, or licensees or to any property under
the control or custody of Seller. Seller hereby covenants and agrees to defend
and indemnify Buyer, its officers, employees, agents, students, invitees and
guests and save them harmless from any and all liability, loss, costs, or
obligations to the extent on account of, or arising out of, any such injury or
losses caused or claimed to be caused by the exercise of the easement or use
of the Easement Area by Seller, however occurring, other than those caused
solely by the willful or negligent acts or omissions of Buyer. Seller alone
shall pay any and all taxes, charges or use fee(s) levied by any Governmental
Authority against Seller's interest in the Easement Area, or against any of
Buyer's Real Property as a result of the easement herein granted. Seller shall
not cause liens of any kind to be placed against the Easement Area or any of
Buyer's Real Property. This Section 7.12 (d) contains the entire agreement
between the Parties relating to the rights herein granted and the obligations
herein assumed. Any oral representations or modifications concerning this
instrument shall be of no force or effect except in a subsequent modification
in writing, signed

by the Party to be charged. If, at the end of the Easement Term Buyer and
Seller have been unable to agree to the Pipeline Easement pursuant to Section
7.12(b), Buyer shall be entitled to require Seller, at Seller's cost, to
remove or request to have relocated any Excluded Pipelines (in either case
upon reasonable prior notice) that materially or unreasonably interfere with
the operations of the Refinery, including but not limited to requiring Seller
to move any pumps, valves, meters or other equipment associated with the
Excluded Pipeline owned by a Seller Company (or Affiliate) from the Real
Property.



ARTICLE VIII

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF SELLER AND BUYER



Buyer and Seller covenant and agree as follows:

8.01 Antitrust Approvals.



(a)Within ten (10) days after Execution Date or as otherwise mutually agreed
by the Parties, Buyer and Seller shall file or cause to be filed with the
Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice, any State
Attorney General, and any foreign antitrust agency (collectively, "Antitrust
Authorities") any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act or any
other antitrust statutes, rules or regulations applicable to the Contemplated
Transactions. Buyer and Seller shall consult with each other as to the
appropriate time for filing such notifications. Buyer and Seller shall each
bear their respective costs (including legal fees) for the preparation of any
filing.



(b)Buyer and Seller shall respectively use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) respond promptly to any requests for additional information and
documentary materials made by any Antitrust Authority; (ii) make any further
filings or submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable in
connection therewith; and (iii) obtain all required antitrust approvals from
an Antitrust Authority or the termination or expiration of an applicable
antitrust waiting period, including termination or expiration of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and ensure that no Antitrust
Authority restrains, prohibits, or otherwise challenges the legality or
validity of the Contemplated Transactions (each of these is an "Antitrust
Regulatory Approval") at the earliest possible date so as to enable the
Parties to close the Contemplated Transactions. Buyer and Seller shall consult
with each other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in person, with the
staff of any Antitrust Authority, and each Party shall have the right to have
a representative present at any such meeting (subject to the approval of the
relevant Antitrust Authority). Buyer and Seller shall give each other
reasonable advance notice of any notification, submission or other
communication which it proposes to make or submit to any Antitrust Authority
and to provide each other with copies of a draft notification, submission or
correspondence and any supporting documentation or information reasonably
requested by the other Party, provided that no Party shall be required to
disclose any Confidential Information under this subsection. Each Party agrees
to consider in good faith any comments of the other Parties to any such
notification, submission or communication. It is acknowledged and agreed that
Buyer shall have, except for the Seller's Election and where prohibited by
Applicable Law, sole responsibility for determining the strategy for dealing
with Antitrust Authorities, including any Antitrust Regulatory Approval;
provided that Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably aware of the conduct of
activities by Buyer under this Section 8.01.

(c)Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate potential
remedies to any impediment to an Antitrust Regulatory Approval that may be
asserted by any Antitrust Authority against Buyer or the Contemplated
Transactions including, but not limited to, (i) the sale, divestiture,
disposition, or holding separate by Buyer of any of its own assets or the
Assets to be directly or indirectly acquired in the Contemplated Transactions;
(ii) any



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 52 of 92

* * *



settlement or other agreement with an Antitrust Authority to undertake any
obligation or commitment related to the conduct of Buyer's business including,
but not limited to, the Assets to be directly or indirectly acquired in the
Contemplated Transactions (each of (i) and (ii), "Antitrust Condition"). In
the event that Buyer, in its reasonable discretion, determines that committing
to or effecting an Antitrust Condition is the most expeditious means of
obtaining Antitrust Regulatory Approval, Buyer agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to proactively, promptly and vigorously negotiate the
reduction, modification or removal of any such Antitrust Condition proposed or
offered by an Antitrust Authority. If as a result of such negotiations, an
Antitrust Condition exists that Buyer reasonably determines has an aggregate
detrimental economic impact on Buyer and/or its Affiliates, the Assets and/or
the Operations of less than Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000), Buyer shall
be required to commit to or effect the Antitrust Condition in order to either
(x) obtain an Antitrust Regulatory Approval, or (y) to effect the dissolution
of, any decree, temporary restraining order, injunction, judgment, or other
order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of
materially delaying or preventing the closing of the Contemplated
Transactions. Nothing in this section or any other provision of this Agreement
shall require Buyer to commit to or effect any Antitrust Condition that Buyer
reasonably determines has an aggregate detrimental economic impact on Buyer
and/or its Affiliates, the Assets and/or the Operations greater than or equal
to Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000). In addition, in its sole discretion,
Buyer may elect to defend through litigation on the merits any Claim asserted
before any Governmental Authority that would restrain or prevent the closing
of the Contemplated Transactions by the Outside Date. If Buyer elects not to
or ceases to defend any such Claim, Buyer shall notify Seller promptly in
writing. Seller shall have the right (the "Seller's Election") to require
Buyer to defend such Claim provided that (i) 100% of all reasonable and
documented third party costs incurred by Buyer as a result of the Seller's
Election in connection with such defense ("Buyer's Defense Costs") up to Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) and (ii) 50% of Buyer's Defense Costs in excess
of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) shall be either (1) deducted from the
Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee payable by Buyer to Seller
pursuant Section 16.04(b) and Section 16.04(c), respectively or (2) reimbursed
by Seller in the event of any termination of this Agreement other than arising
from (x) a termination by Seller pursuant to Section 16.01(d) or (y) the
Closing not occurring when required due to Buyer's failure to close the
Contemplated Transactions in accordance with Section 3.01(a) when all
conditions precedent to Buyer's closing obligations set forth in Article XI
shall have been satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied if the
Closing were to occur on the date of such breach by Buyer). Under no other
circumstances shall Seller be liable for the Buyer's Defense Costs. If Buyer
elects not to commit to or effect any Antitrust Condition or to defend any
Claim, and Seller does not elect to exercise its right to require Buyer to
defend any Claim, then Buyer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
16.01(g).



8.02 Assignments.



(a)With respect to any Refinery Contract, Easement or Permit that (i) is
intended to be assigned to Buyer hereunder and (ii) requires consent for the
assignment thereof to Buyer, Seller (or, if agreed by Seller, a mutually
agreed third party agent) shall take such actions as are commercially
reasonable and necessary, and Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in all
commercially reasonable respects, to effect assignment thereof to Buyer as of
the Closing Date. It is understood that such actions by Seller shall not
include any requirement of the Seller Companies or their Affiliates to expend
money greater than a de minimis amount in the overall context of this
Agreement, give any guaranty or surety, commence any litigation or offer or
grant any non-de minimis accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third
party. To the extent allowed by Applicable Law, Seller shall initiate
termination procedures on any Refinery Contracts requested by Buyer to be
effective upon the Closing provided that such terminations do not require the
Seller Companies or their Affiliates to expend money, give any guaranty or
surety, or grant



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 53 of 92

* * *



any non-de minimis accommodation (financial or otherwise) to the
counterparties to such Contracts.



(b)In the event that a Seller Company is unable to obtain the requisite
approval for assignment of any such Contract, Easement or Permit, or in the
event such Contract, Easement or Permit is required to be amended or
supplemented and is not so amended or supplemented as of the Closing Date, and
such assignment is reasonably necessary to operate the Assets in the Ordinary
Course of Business as conducted by such Seller Company or its Affiliates on an
historical basis for the twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date without
giving rise to a material adverse effect on the Assets, at the written request
of Buyer (i) on or before the Closing Date or within thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date of the then known Assets, or (ii) or within thirty (30) days
after discovery of Assets not known on or before the Closing Date (except, in
either case of (i) or (ii), where such action would be unlawful or prohibited
by such Contract, Easement or Permit), Seller shall (x) retain any such
Contract, Easement or Permit and shall enter into an arrangement with Buyer
(including, to the extent appropriate amending the Transition Services
Agreement) to provide Buyer with the economic and functional benefits of such
Contract, Easement or Permit, provided, that Buyer shall perform the Seller
Companies' and their Affiliates' obligations thereunder arising on or after
the Closing Date (and indemnify, defend and hold the Seller Companies and
their Affiliates harmless against Losses suffered in the event Buyer breaches
any obligations thereunder) until such Contract, Easement or Permit is
assigned to Buyer, expires in accordance with its terms (after giving effect
to any renewals) or a replacement Contract, Easement or Permit is issued, or
is properly amended or supplemented, and (y) take all commercially reasonable
and necessary actions required to assign to Buyer, or amend or supplement, any
such Contract, Easement or Permit as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date.



(c)Notwithstanding Seller's obligations pursuant to Section 8.02(a), the
assignment of any Contract, Easement or Permit to be transferred to Buyer that
requires consent for assignment, or amendment or supplement, may be effected
after the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Purchase Price shall not be subject to adjustment, and the Closing of the
Contemplated Transactions shall not be delayed, by reason of any inability to
obtain consent for assignment of any Contract, Easement or Permit or any such
amendment or supplement. Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the
Contemplated Transactions are required from counterparties to Contracts,
Easements or Permits (written or otherwise) to which any of the Seller
Companies or their Affiliates is a party, and Seller represents that to
Seller's Knowledge the consents listed on Schedule 8.02(c) may not be
obtained. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer agrees that
the Seller Companies and their Affiliates shall not have any liability
whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions by this Agreement or because of the default,
acceleration or termination of any such agreement, contract, license, lease,
Easement or Permit as a result thereof (provided that Seller has complied with
its obligations under Section 8.02(a) and Section 8.02(b)). Buyer further
agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein
shall be breached or deemed breached and no condition of Buyer shall be deemed
not to be satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain any consent or as a
result of any such default, acceleration or termination or any Claim or
Proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Persons arising out
of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination (provided that Seller have complied with its
obligations under Section 8.02(a) and Section 8.02(b) and its representation
in this Section 8.02(c) is true and correct in all material respects).









Sale and Purchase Agreement

8.03 Transition Plan; Multi-Site Framework Contracts.



(a)Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, representatives of
Buyer and Seller shall meet to develop a transition plan identifying
resources, timelines, and other milestones needed for operation of the Assets
after the Closing; provided, however, that, nothing in this Section 8.03(a) or
such transition plan shall restrict or limit the Seller Companies' or their
respective Affiliates' ability to conduct their own business and operate the
Assets prior to Closing.



(b)In furtherance of Section 8.03(a), from the Execution Date until the
Closing Date and, if requested by Buyer, for a period not to exceed ninety
(90) days after Closing Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller Companies to,
use reasonable commercial efforts to co-operate with and assist Buyer in its
(a) identifying all material assets, rights and other properties (other than
Shell Intellectual Property), including in respect of software and other
information technology, that will not be assigned, transferred or conveyed to
Buyer as part of the Assets at Closing, and that are necessary in order to
permit Buyer to be able to operate the Refinery and Assets immediately
following Closing substantially in the manner that such business is currently
conducted by Seller, including to permit Buyer to comply with its obligations
under Section 8.13, and (b) otherwise developing and assisting in the
implementation of the transition plan described in Section 8.03(a) so as to
permit Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, to acquire and deploy any and all
such material assets, rights and other properties prior to the Closing Date so
as to ensure that the operation of the business of Refinery and Assets is not
materially interrupted or interfered with as a result of the Closing and to
otherwise replace any services provided to the Assets by Shell Companies prior
to Closing.



(c)For the avoidance of doubt, in respect of the foregoing, following
transition period set forth in Section 8.03(b), Buyer shall not be permitted
to obtain goods or services pursuant to any call-off agreements under the
Multi-Site Framework Contracts without the prior written consent of Seller
(which Seller can withhold in its sole discretion). Should Buyer obtain any
goods or services under any Multi-Site Framework Contract following Closing
(whether with or without Seller's consent), Buyer shall indemnify Seller in
full for any and all Losses, including without limitation for non-payment of
the costs of goods or services or any disputes between Buyer and a third
party, arising therefrom. From the Execution Date until the Closing Date and,
if requested by Buyer, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days after
Closing, the Parties shall work together to identify any existing Multi-Site
Framework Contracts and cooperate on the replacement of same, provided that
Buyer shall be solely responsible for effecting any such replacements, and no
Seller Company shall be obligated to allow "call-offs" to Buyer under such
Multi-Site Framework Contract.



8.04 Other Governmental Approvals. With the exception of Antitrust Regulatory
Approval, which is covered in Section 8.01, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
with each other and take all reasonable steps necessary to obtain
Authorizations for the sale of the Assets from all applicable Governmental
Authorities.



8.05 Other Actions. Buyer and Seller shall otherwise use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (a) the satisfaction of all covenants
and agreements in this Article VIII and all conditions precedent in Article XI
and Article XII, in each case, applicable to it, and (b) the Closing, to occur
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Execution Date.



8.06 Collection of Amounts Owed to a Party. In the event any Party receives
any funds or other property that belongs to another Party pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement then the receiving Party shall receive and hold such
funds and property in trust for the benefit of the rightful Party and shall



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 55 of 92

* * *



promptly forward such funds and property to the rightful Party. It is the
intention of the Parties that, as between the Parties, Seller shall be
entitled to all income attributable to the Operations conducted prior to the
Effective Time and Buyer shall be entitled to all income attributable to the
Operations conducted after the Effective Time. Each Party shall pay to the
other Party, promptly after receipt thereof, any amount received by said Party
from any third party with respect to rentals, fees or other revenues relating
to the Operations and attributable to the ownership period of the other Party;
and products delivered, services performed or other obligations performed by
the other Party and attributable to the ownership period of such other Party.



8.07 Casualty.



(a)In the event prior to the Closing Date there is an occurrence of a
Casualty, Seller shall notify Buyer thereof as soon as reasonably practicable.



(b)In the event a Casualty occurs prior to the Closing Date then Seller shall
elect, at its option, to either (i) repair or replace the affected Asset at
Seller's cost prior to the Closing, in which case Buyer's obligation to effect
the Closing shall not be affected, but the Closing Date shall be deferred
until ten (10) Business Days after repairs or replacement have been completed
and the affected Asset has been restored to at least a substantially
comparable performance in all material respects as compared to that prior to
the Casualty, or (ii) negotiate with Buyer to reduce the Purchase Price by an
amount agreed to by Seller and Buyer to reflect the cost to repair or replace
the affected Asset(s) (the "Repair Costs"), in which case, the Closing Date
shall not be deferred unless Buyer and Seller do not agree to the cost of such
repairs or replacements.



(c)If Seller elects to proceed with clause (ii) of Section 8.07(b) and Seller
and Buyer agree on the Repair Costs within fifteen (15) days of Buyer's
receipt of Seller's notice of Casualty (the "Repair Negotiation Period"),
Buyer's obligation to effect the Closing shall not be affected but the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Repair Costs. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Parties mutually agree that the Repair Costs are greater
than an amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the Base Amount, either Seller
or Buyer may elect, by giving written notice to the other of such election
within five (5) Business Days of the expiration of the Repair Negotiation
Period, to terminate this Agreement without further obligation under this
Agreement (other than those sections which expressly survive termination,
which shall continue in effect).



(d)If however, the Parties do not agree on the Repair Costs within the Repair
Negotiation Period (a "Repair Cost Dispute"), either Party may request an
engineering company mutually agreed to by the Parties (or selected pursuant to
Section 8.07(g)) (the "Independent Expert") to evaluate the affected Assets
and deliver to the Parties its written estimate of the Repair Costs (the
"Third Party Estimate") within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Repair
Negotiation Period.

(i)If the Third Party Estimate is less than or equal to thirty percent (30%)
of the Base Amount, then Buyer's obligation to proceed to Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall not be affected and the
Parties shall submit the Repair Cost Dispute to binding arbitration under the
dispute resolution procedures in Article XVII for resolution after the
Closing, with no reduction of the Closing Date Payment at Closing and a post-
Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to the finally-determined
Repair Costs.



(ii)If the Third Party Estimate is greater than thirty percent (30%) of the
Base Amount, either Seller or Buyer may elect, by giving written notice to the
other of election within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Third-Party
Estimate, to terminate this Agreement without further obligation under this
Agreement (other than those sections which expressly survive termination,
which shall continue in effect). If neither Party terminates

within such time period, the Parties shall submit the Repair Cost Dispute to
binding arbitration under the dispute resolution procedures in Article XVII
for resolution after the Closing, with no delay in Closing, no reduction of
the Closing Date Payment at Closing and a post-Closing adjustment to the
Purchase Price equal to the finally-determined Repair Costs.



(e)Any adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 8.07(d) which is
necessary to reflect a final determination of Repair Costs after the Closing
shall be made as follows: (i) an adjustment in favor of Buyer shall be paid in
immediately available funds by Seller to Buyer; and (ii) an adjustment in
favor of Seller shall be paid in immediately available funds to the extent the
Purchase Price had been reduced pursuant to this Section 8.07. Any such
reduction, refund or payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after
such final determination.



(f)In the event of a Repair Cost Dispute, the Closing Date and Outside Date
shall be deferred until (i) fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the
Third Party Estimate, or (ii) if Seller elects the option in clause (i) of
Section 8.07(b), as provided therein.



(g)Selection and Fees of Independent Expert.

(i)If (1) the Parties are unable to agree on the Independent Expert within
fifteen (15) days after the end of the Repair Negotiation Period, or (2)
Seller and Buyer have agreed on an Independent Expert, but such Person has
notified Seller or Buyer that it is unwilling or unable to serve as the
Independent Expert, then within the earlier of ten (10) days after the end of
such fifteen (15) day period or after such notice by the proposed Independent
Expert (the "Nomination Deadline"), Seller and Buyer shall each select a
candidate for the Independent Expert and the two candidates so selected shall
promptly select a third independent, engineering company which shall be
appointed as the Independent Expert. If a Party fails to select an Independent
Expert by the Nomination Deadline, then the candidate Independent Expert
selected by the other Party (provided it made such nomination by the
Nomination Deadline) shall be the Independent Expert for purposes of this
Section 8.07.



(ii)Upon an Independent Expert being agreed or selected under the foregoing
provisions of Section 8.07(g)(i), Seller and Buyer shall together jointly
notify such Independent Expert of the selection and shall request the
Independent Accountant within ten (10) days to confirm in writing whether it
accepts such appointment.



(iii)If, following notification pursuant to Section 8.07(g)(ii), such
Independent Expert shall not have confirmed its acceptance of such appointment
within the said period of ten (10) days, then (unless the Parties are able to
mutually agree upon the appointment of another Independent Expert) the matter
may again be referred in the manner aforesaid under Section 8.07(g)(i) above
to make a further selection and the process shall be repeated until an
Independent Expert is found who accepts appointment.



(iv)The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert will be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.



8.08 Payment of Certain Expenses Due and Payable after the Closing Date.



(a)The Closing Date Payment shall be increased by the pro-rated amount of all
lease and rental payments made by the Seller Companies or their Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date in respect of the Assets but that are attributable
to periods after the Effective Time. The Closing Date Payment shall be
decreased by the pro-rated amount of all lease and rental payments in respect
of the Assets to be made by Buyer subsequent to the Effective Time but that



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 57 of 92

* * *



are attributable to periods prior to the Effective Time. The Parties shall
share information among themselves prior to the Closing Date to identify and
pro-rate such amounts.



(b)If Buyer receives invoices for fees for Environmental Credits, permit fees
and utility bills for any period of time prior to the Effective Time, Buyer
will promptly forward such invoices to Seller. If any Seller Company receives
invoices for fees for Environmental Credits, permit fees and utility bills for
any period of time on or after the Effective Time, Seller shall promptly
forward the invoices to Buyer.



(c)Buyer shall pay, as and when due, all fees for Environmental Credits,
permit fees and utility bills due and payable after the Effective Time, and
Seller shall reimburse Buyer within thirty (30) days after invoice for any

Time.



(d)If a Party makes any payment to a third party pursuant to any Refinery
Contract, and such payment is made in respect of work performed, services
provided or goods delivered during a period of time that includes the
Effective Time; or the Effective Time intervenes between the making of such
payment and the performance of the work or services or delivery of goods, then
the Parties will allocate the burden of such payment in a manner that reflects
the relative benefit of such work performed, services provided or goods
delivered to each Party; provided, however, it shall be presumed that any work
performed, services provided or goods delivered prior to the Effective Time
are for the benefit of a Seller Company and any work performed, services
provided or goods delivered after the Effective Time are for the benefit of
Buyer or its Affiliates.

contract or commitment, assume any obligation or make any representation or
warranty on behalf of the others (except as expressly specified in this
Agreement or the Closing Documents). The Parties agree and acknowledge that
except as expressly provided herein or in the Closing Documents, none of the
Parties or their respective Affiliates shall owe duties, fiduciary or
otherwise to the other. The Parties and their respective Affiliates are, and
will be after Closing, competitors with the right to pursue any business
opportunity for their respective individual benefit and make no representation
or warranty regarding the manner in which they will conduct their respective
businesses and operations. None of the Parties or their respective Affiliates
shall have any obligation to refrain from (a) engaging in the same or similar
activities or lines of business as the Parties or their respective Affiliates,
(b) developing or marketing any products or services that compete, directly or
indirectly with those Parties or their respective Affiliates, (c) investing or
owning any interest publicly or privately in, or developing a business
relationship with, any Person engaged in the same or similar activities or

by any Party, each Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further actions which are consistent with, and customary
and necessary for, the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding, Seller and Buyer shall contact all

to pay, perform and discharge when due, payments of California Childhood Lead

seq.). Buyer shall assume and agree to pay, perform and discharge when due,
payments of California Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Fees to the extent
assessed and issued to Buyer by said Department under said Act.



8.12 Compliance Matters. Subject to Applicable Laws or the preservation of
legal privilege, in the event a Party has a reasonable belief that the other
Party has breached the Anti-Corruption Laws in connection with this Agreement
or the Contemplated Transactions or, if Buyer has a reasonable belief that the
Seller has breached the Anti-Corruption Laws in respect of its ownership
and/or Operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time, the Party shall
have a right to audit the other Party's relevant books and records to
determine whether such a breach has occurred.



8.13 Information Technology.

certain Seller's Software, IT Systems, Third Party Software, IT Equipment and
Non-Group IT Equipment in connection with the Assets and their associated
businesses.



(b)Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall grant to Buyer a license to continue
to use copies of certain Seller's Software pursuant to the Shell Software
License Agreement. As of the Execution Date, Schedule 1 to the form of
Software License Agreement identifies certain Seller's Software that Seller

agreement as of the Closing Date. During the Interim Period, if the Parties
determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that certain of Seller's
Software not listed on Schedule 1 to the form of Software License Agreement
that is used in the Operation of the Refinery would be essential and necessary
for the operation of the Refinery, at the pre-Closing level, by Buyer from and
after Closing, then prior to Closing the Parties will amend Schedule 1 to the
form of Software License Agreement to include such Seller's Software.



(c)The Parties shall cooperate to identify, as soon as reasonably practical
following the Execution Date, any relevant material Third Party Software and
Non-Group IT Equipment. If Buyer proposes to continue using any Third Party
Software or any Non-Group IT Equipment on and following the Closing Date
(including where Buyer uses such Third Party Software or Non-Group IT
Equipment under licenses or leases granted to Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller), then, at the request and cost of Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate with a view to contacting relevant third parties to obtain, before
Closing, any licenses, leases or consents that may be required to allow such
continued use. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges that:

(i)Seller gives no warranty or representation that any such license, lease or
consent will be granted; and



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 59 of 92

* * *



(ii)neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller is obliged to grant or continue
(and Seller and any Affiliate of Seller may without liability terminate) any
sub-license or lease to allow Buyer to use Third Party Software or Non-Group
IT Equipment on or following the Closing Date.



(d)Buyer undertakes with Seller, for the benefit of Seller and Seller's
Affiliates, that, subject to Section 8.13(e), Buyer will have no rights in
Seller's Software, the Third Party Software, IT Systems, IT Equipment, or the
Non-Group IT Equipment whatsoever, and Buyer shall ensure that:



(i)Buyer does not use any Seller's Software (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Seller infrastructure desktop operational software as provided by other
Affiliates of Seller to the Seller Companies, which will not be licensed or
otherwise transferred to Buyer for use on or after the Closing Date), IT
Systems, Third Party Software, IT Equipment or Non-Group IT Equipment on or
after the Closing Date; and



(ii)within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, any Seller's
Software or Third Party Software remaining on the IT systems of the Assets is
permanently removed or deleted from such system and any copies and archives of
such software and data are permanently destroyed and Buyer shall confirm such
permanent deletion in writing to Seller or, at Seller's request, returned to
Seller or another Affiliate of Seller identified by Seller to Buyer.

(i)to Seller's Software to the extent that Buyer permitted to use that
Software under the Shell Software License Agreement or any other Closing
Document; or

is permitted to use that Software or Equipment under a consent, license or
lease obtained under Section 8.13(c) or otherwise granted by the owner of the
intellectual property rights in that Third Party Software, IT Systems or by
the owner of that IT Equipment or Non-Group IT Equipment.



(f)Except to the extent otherwise provided for under this Agreement (including
any Schedule hereto) or any Closing Document, on or before the Closing Date,
the Assets shall be removed from the IT Systems of Seller and its Affiliates,
and neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall have any liability
whatsoever after the Closing Date in relation to the provision to, or supply
to Buyer or the Assets of:



(i)any information technology related hardware, software, components, data,
databases and/or services; or



(ii)any access to the IT Systems of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller.



(g)Buyer shall ensure that:



(i)Within three (3) years after the Closing Date, all the Shell IP-addresses
have been removed from, and all references to Shell, Seller, Seller Companies
and other Affiliates of Seller, have been removed from all IT System names and
identifiers of, the information technology networks of the Assets and Buyer;
and





Sale and Purchase Agreement

* * *



(ii)until the Shell IP-addresses have been removed from and all references to
Shell, Seller, Seller Companies and other Affiliates of Seller have been
removed from all IT System names and identifiers of, the information
technology networks of Buyer and the Assets, the Shell IP-addresses shall only
be used internally and shall not be used for communication with other parties
via the internet without the use of a device or application that dynamically
changes the Shell IP address into an IP address authorized for use on the
internet and owned by Buyer.



(h)Buyer acknowledges that, to the extent that the Assets receive
infrastructure or other IT related services prior to the Closing Date pursuant
to an agreement between Seller or an Affiliate of Seller and the relevant
service provider, Buyer shall not be entitled to receive such services after
Closing under such agreement, and Buyer shall be solely responsible (at its
own cost) for ensuring that Buyer has access to such infrastructure and other
IT related services as it requires after Closing (including by concluding such
new agreements with relevant service providers as may be necessary).



(i)Buyer shall allow Seller or its nominee access to the relevant premises to
verify compliance with the provisions of this Section 8.13, and shall, if so
requested by Seller, provide (at Seller's cost) confirmation of an independent
auditor of Buyer's compliance with this Section 8.13.



(j)Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and Seller's Affiliates from and against any actions, Claims,
Losses, and payments incurred or suffered by Seller or such Affiliates of
Seller as a result of, or relating to, the failure of Buyer to comply with its
obligations under this Section 8.13. In particular, but without limitation to
the foregoing, Buyer shall pay directly to any third party, or reimburse
Seller (and any Affiliate of Seller) in respect of, any costs, fees or
expenses payable in connection with the possession, or use, or access, on or
following the Closing Date, of Third Party Software, IT Systems, IT Equipment
or Non-Group IT Equipment by Buyer (including any monies payable from a Seller
(or an Affiliate of Seller) or Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) to the owner
of the intellectual property rights in the Third Party Software, IT Systems,
IT Equipment or of the Non-Group IT Equipment, whether in relation to the
transfer of existing licenses, subscription services or leases, pursuant to
existing or new licenses or leases or otherwise).



(k)Subject to the foregoing of this Section 8.13:



(i)To the extent Buyer intends to obtain the necessary licenses for and use
certain of the IT Systems and Software associated with the Assets from and
after Closing, Buyer may nominate a reasonable number of its employees and
Representatives for training by Seller prior to Closing on the use of such IT
Systems and Software of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in respect of the
Operation of the Refinery, and upon receipt of such nomination (which shall
identify the requisite IT Systems and Software) Seller shall, and shall cause
the Seller Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to co-operate
with and assist in training Buyer's employees and its Representatives (who may
be required by Seller to sign reasonable confidentiality agreements with
Seller) in the use of such IT Systems and Software; provided that:

Seller makes no representations or warranties as to the efficacy or results of

Closing; and 

 

|

d.

in no event as part of such training shall Buyer's employees or
Representatives be entitled to view commercially sensitive, competitive
information that Seller reasonably believes could result in a violation of the
HSR Act or any other antitrust statutes, rules or regulations applicable to
the Seller Companies. 

 

(ii)To the extent such training occurs at the Refinery, or on or at the Assets
or other premises of the Seller Companies, Section 7.03(e) shall apply.



8.14 Insurance.



(a)Buyer acknowledges that each Seller Company maintains worldwide programs of
property and liability insurance coverage for itself and its Affiliates. In
connection therewith, there exist insurance policies issued directly or
indirectly to the Seller Companies, by an Affiliate wholly-owned, directly or
indirectly, by Royal Dutch Shell plc (the "Seller Captive Insurer") relating
to the Assets. In addition, there exist insurance policies issued directly or
indirectly to the Seller Companies by third parties relating to the Assets
(such policies being collectively, with the policies issued by the Seller
Captive Insurer, the "Seller Insurance Policies").



(b)Buyer acknowledges and agrees that as of the Closing:



(i)no insurance coverage shall be provided under the Seller Insurance Policies
to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, the Assets or any Assumed Liabilities;



(ii)any and all policies insured or reinsured by the Seller Captive Insurer or
any other provider of the Seller Insurance Policies which, but for this
provision, would have insured the Assets shall be deemed terminated, commuted
and cancelled ab initio;



(iii)no claims regarding any matter whatsoever, whether or not arising from
events occurring prior to the Closing, shall be made by Buyer against or with
respect to any of the Seller Insurance Policies regardless of their date of
issuance;



(iv)Buyer shall be responsible for securing the insurance it considers
appropriate for the operation of the Assets after the Closing; and



(v)Buyer has no right, title or interest in any unearned premiums on any
policies maintained by or for the benefit of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller.



(c)Buyer acknowledges that:



(i)As part of the Seller Insurance Policies program, Seller maintains a
Rolling Contractor Insurance Program ("RCIP") for the Refinery, which provides
certain Refinery contractors (and their subcontractors) enrolled in the RCIP
with workers compensation, employer's liability and general liability
insurance;





Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 62 of 92

* * *



(ii)as of the Closing Date and in accordance with Section 8.14(b) above, the
RCIP program coverage provided by Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller) shall
terminate and cease; and



(iii)thereafter the risk and any liability associated with any gap in or lack
of coverage that was previously provided by Seller's RCIP shall be the
responsibility of Buyer.



8.15 Title Policies; Surveys.



(a)Seller has ordered at its sole cost and expense, and has caused to be
delivered to Buyer, a preliminary title report or commitment prepared by the
Title Company for issuance of an ALTA 2006 Owner's Policy of Title Insurance
setting forth the status of the title of the Refinery Owned Real Property, the
Refinery Leased Real Property and the Easements (other than the pipelines
identified on Schedule 2.01(a)(2)) and all encumbrances, easements, rights-of-
way, encroachments, reservations, restrictions, and other matters of record
affecting the foregoing, together with copies of all instruments of record
referred to therein ("Title Commitment"). Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the delivery of an updated Title Commitment to
Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable following the Execution Date, and in
all events, within ten (10) days after the Execution Date. Buyer and Seller
agree Buyer shall engage a mutually acceptable independent, reputable surveyor
at Buyer's sole cost, to procure an ALTA survey ("Survey") with respect to the
Refinery Owned Real Property.



(b)Buyer will have a period of twenty (20) Business Days from its receipt of
the last of the Survey and the updated Title Commitment ("Title Review
Period") in which to review the same and provide the Seller and Title Company
with written notice ("Title Notice") of any condition disclosed in such Survey
or Title Commitment that Buyer does not approve in its sole discretion (each,
a "Disapproved Title Condition"); provided, however, all Liens shall be deemed
Disapproved Title Conditions and Seller in all instances shall be required, at
its sole cost, to cure and remove all Liens prior to the Closing Date.



(c)Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (but in
any event no later than at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the
scheduled Closing Date) cure or remove, to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction,
each Disapproved Title Condition set forth on the Title Notice without the
payment of any funds, unless so elected by Seller ("Seller Elected Curative
Costs") and provided that Seller shall be required, at its sole cost, to cure
and remove all Liens prior to the Closing Date ("Lien Curative Costs"). In the
event Seller is unable to cure or remove, to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction,
all Disapproved Title Conditions listed on the Title Notice(s) (other than
Liens) without the payment of any funds no later than fifteen (15) Business
Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date ("Title Defect Conditions"), Seller
may offer, by written offer notice to Buyer no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, to use commercially reasonable,
diligent good faith efforts, at its sole cost, to cure or remove any or all of
the Title Defect Conditions, which shall constitute Retained Liabilities of
Seller for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified pursuant
to Section 13.02 until such time as Seller shall have either cured or removed
the same, to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, or paid to Buyer the Title
Defect Amount allocated to the same (as determined pursuant to this Section
8.15(c)) ("Post Closing Title Cure Offer"). Buyer may, in its sole discretion,
accept Seller's offer with respect to any, some or all of the Title Defect
Conditions by written notice to Seller within five (5) Business Days of
Buyer's receipt of the Post-Closing Title Cure Offer (all Title Defect
Conditions so accepted by Buyer, the "Post-Closing Title Defects"). Buyer's
failure or election to timely respond in writing to a Post-Closing Title Cure
Offer shall be deemed Buyer's rejection of the offer made therein. The Post-
Closing Title Cure Offer and Post-Closing Title Defects shall constitute
Closing Documents hereunder. Seller shall, at its sole



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 63 of 92

* * *



cost, use commercially reasonable, diligent good faith efforts to cure or
remove the Post-Closing Title Defects after the Closing. To the extent any
Post-Closing Title Defects are not cured or removed from title to Buyer's
reasonable satisfaction, Seller shall pay to Buyer, no later than seventy-five
(75) days after the Closing Date, the Title Defect Amount allocated to each
such remaining Post-Closing Title Defects (as determined pursuant to Section
8.15(d)) not cured or removed within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date.
If Title Insurance (as defined below) was issued at Closing and Seller cured
or removed any Title Defect Conditions after the Closing Date, Seller shall,
at its sole cost, cause the Title Company to re-issue or date down the Title
Insurance no later than seventy five (75) days after the Closing Date to
account for the cure or removal of such cured Post-Closing Title Defects.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller's obligations under this Section 8.15(c) shall survive the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions and the Closing.



(d)Seller and Buyer shall, within forty five (45) days of the date of the
Title Notice, (i) come to a reasonable agreement as to the amount (A)
necessary to cure or remove, to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, all Title
Defect Conditions that have not been cured or removed as of such date and (B)
of the diminution of fair market value resulting from Title Defect Conditions
that are not capable of cure or removal (each individually, a "Title Defect
Amount" and collectively, the "Title Defect Amount"). In the event Seller and
Buyer are unable to come to agreement on any Title Defect Amount and/or the
aggregate Title Defect Amount, (i) Seller and Buyer shall mutually agree upon
an independent, reputable third party commercial appraiser with whom neither
party has worked with in the prior five (5) years (a "Third Party Appraiser")
(x) who shall promptly (and in all cases within ten (10) days of selection)
determine each Title Defect Amount and (y) whose determination, solely for
purposes of this Agreement, shall be final, and (ii) if Seller and Buyer
cannot agree on a Third Party Appraiser within such time period, Seller and
Buyer shall each, within five (5) days of such deadline, select its own Third
Party Appraiser who shall promptly (and in all cases within ten (10) days of
selection) determine each Title Defect Amount, and the final Title Defect
Amount shall be the arithmetic mean of each of the two determinations;
provided that if the difference between the total Title Defect Amount
determined by each of the Third Party Appraisers exceeds Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000.00), then the two Third Party Appraisers shall select a
third Third Party Appraiser within ten (10) days. The third Third Party
Appraiser shall review each proposed Title Defect Amount determined by the two
Third Party Appraisers and select the one that it determines is closest to the
correct amounts. The third Third Party Appraiser's selection of each Title
Defect Amount shall be final and binding on the parties. Once agreed or
determined (including selected) pursuant to the foregoing process, each Title
Defect Amount and the total Title Defect Amount shall be a Retained Liability
of Seller for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified
pursuant to Section 13.02 until such time as Seller shall have either cured or
removed the same, to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, or paid to Buyer by
Seller, and Seller shall pay to Buyer the total Title Defect Amount within
thirty (30) days of determination. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller's obligations under this Section
8.15(d) shall survive the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.



(e)Seller shall cause the Title Company to issue to Buyer an American Land
Title Association "ALTA" 2006 Owner's Policy of title insurance, with such
endorsements as are reasonably requested by Buyer, insuring Buyer's interest
in the Refinery Owned Real Property, the Refinery Leased Real Property and the
Easements (other than the pipelines identified on Schedule 2.01(a)(2)), dated
as of the day the Deeds are recorded, in the form of a title pro forma
approved by Buyer (which pro forma shall be based upon the Title Commitment,
without any title exceptions or exclusions not listed thereunder and without
any Liens or Disapproved Title Conditions (excluding those constituting Title
Defect Conditions that are Post-Closing Title Defects), in the amount of the
fair market value of the insured estate, as reasonably determined by Buyer, at
least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date ("Title Insurance"). Seller
shall pay for the California Land Title



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Association portion of the Title Insurance, the cost of all Seller Elected
Curative Costs and all Lien Curative Costs and Buyer shall pay the ALTA
portion of the Title Insurance and the costs of any additional endorsements
required by Buyer.



(f)Seller shall cause the Title Company to issue an update to the Title
Commitment as of fifteen (15) Business Days immediately prior to the Closing
Date. In the event that the update discloses any defect, Lien, encumbrance or
other matter not included in the original Title Commitment, the procedure set
forth in Sections 8.15(b), (c) and (d) above shall apply and a new Title
Review Period shall begin; provided that Buyer shall have five (5) Business
Days to provide Seller with a Title Notice, Seller shall have five (5)
Business Days to cure or remove, to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, each
Disapproved Title Condition, without the payment of any funds, unless so
elected by Seller and provided that Seller shall be required, at its sole
cost, to cure and remove all Liens prior to the Closing Date, and, in the
event of any Title Defect Conditions, Seller and Buyer shall come to a
reasonable agreement as to the Title Defect Amount within three (3) Business
Days of the Seller's failure to cure or remove the same. Section 8.15(d) shall
also apply, provided that each time period provided therein shall be reduced
by two (2) Business Days.



(g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all matters
that are included in the Schedules or otherwise disclosed by Seller to Buyer
shall have no effect on the determination of any Disapproved Title Condition,
Title Defect Condition or Title Defect Amount. Nothing in this Section 8.15
shall (i) delay or prevent the Closing or (ii) relieve Seller from a remedy
Buyer may have from Seller's breach of any representation or warranty
contained in Article IV.



(h)Seller shall not be required and are not obligated to bring any
Proceedings, convey or acquire any interest in real property, incur any
expense or liability (other than as expressly set forth in this Section 8.15
and with respect to Post-Closing Title Defects) with respect to the removal or
cure of Title Defect Condition or take any other action of any kind or nature
to render title to any of the Refinery Owned Real Property free and clear of
any title or survey exceptions, objections or encumbrances, and Buyer shall
have no right of specific performance or other relief against Seller to cause
any Title Defect Condition to be satisfied or cured other than Liens in
respect of the Refinery Owned Real Property and as expressly set forth in this
Section 8.15.



8.16 Renewable Diesel Project. For a period of up to four (4) years after the
Execution Date, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith with one another
with the intent of agreeing to terms on the Renewable Diesel Project within
such period and the objective that, upon agreement on such terms, the project
would reach commercial operation date within four (4) years after the
Execution Date and without the prior written consent of Seller, during such
period, Buyer shall not, either directly or indirectly, whether through it, an
Affiliate, by contract or otherwise, undertake any project, agreement,
arrangement, transaction or undertaking substantially similar to the Renewable
Diesel Project at the Refinery (including deploying third party hydrogen based
or non-hydrogen based renewable diesel technology or retrofit/alteration

13.04 Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between Buyer and Seller.



(a)Each of Seller and Buyer may nominate an indemnification Claims manager
(the "Claims Manager") prior to Closing, and may provide updated contact
information pursuant to Section 18.01 after Closing if such Party desires to
nominate a different Claims Manager. If a Party designates a Claims Manager,
such person shall both deliver and receive Claim Notices for the applicable
Party for all purposes of indemnification under this Agreement (including
Schedule 15.01). Any Claim Notice not sent to the designated Claims Manager by
the other Party shall not be valid under this Agreement to the extent a Party
is actually Prejudiced thereby. The Claims Manager may manage any Claim
directly or indirectly through another Person.



(b)Following the discovery of any facts or conditions that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Claim or Loss for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as reasonably
possible thereafter, provide written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
Indemnifying Party setting forth:



(i)the specific facts and circumstances, in reasonable detail, relating to
such Claim or Loss;



(ii)the amount of such Claim or Loss (or a good-faith estimate thereof to the
extent that the actual amount is not known and a reasonable calculation can be
made); and



(iii)the relevant provision(s) of this Agreement under which the Party is
seeking the indemnity.



provided, however, that failure to give such Claim Notice on a timely basis
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
that such Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure to provide a Claim Notice. A notice
setting forth a speculative, prospective, unspecified or possible future Claim
shall not constitute an adequate or timely Claim Notice but, for the avoidance
of doubt, a Claim may be made when a Loss arises even if the precise amount of
the Loss cannot be ascertained. Without prejudice to sub-clauses (b)(i)-(iii)
above, upon a reasonable request from the Party receiving the Claim Notice,
the Party seeking indemnification shall provide such written documentation
held or received by such Party in relation to the matter in the Claim Notice
as the receiving Party shall reasonably request; provided that the foregoing
shall not require a Party to violate its attorney-client privilege or
confidentiality rights or obligations to a third party.

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 13.04(b):



(i)a Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnity hereunder
against Seller unless and until (A) such Indemnified Party shall have provided
Seller a Claim Notice; and (B) Seller shall have failed to cure such claim, if
curable, within thirty (30) days after Seller's receipt of a Claim Notice;



(ii)a Seller Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnity hereunder
against Buyer unless and until (A) such Indemnified Party shall have provided
Buyer a Claim Notice; and (B) Buyer shall have failed to cure such claim, if
curable, within thirty (30) days after Buyer's receipt of a Claim Notice; and



(iii)without prejudice to the time periods specified in the foregoing Sections
13.04(c)(i) and 13.04(c)(ii), upon receipt of a Claim Notice, the Party
receiving such notice



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 71 of 92

* * *



shall, within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt thereof, inform via notice
the notifying Party if the receiving Party is or is not indemnifying the
notifying Party under this Agreement. Should the receiving Party fail to so
respond to the notice delivered by the notifying Party within twenty (20)
Business Days of receipt thereof, the receiving Party shall be deemed to have
accepted the notifying Party's assertion that such matter is indemnifiable by
the receiving Party under this Agreement. In case the receiving Party rejects
the notifying Party's assertion that the relevant matter in the notice is
indemnifiable by the receiving Party under this Agreement, the notifying Party
may resort to the dispute resolution procedures of ARTICLE XVII.



13.05 Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims.



(a)Subject to Section 13.04 above, with respect to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a
Claim or demand made by any third party Person against an Indemnified Party (a
"Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must provide a Claim Notice to
the Indemnifying Party of the Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably
practicable after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third
Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the
Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that the failure to provide a Claim Notice, or deliver
copies of all notices and documents, in a reasonably timely manner shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure.



(b)If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to participate in the
defense thereof (it being understood that the Indemnified Party shall control
such defense unless the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense as provided
herein) and, if the Indemnifying Party so chooses and acknowledges its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party provided that such
counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
any acknowledgment made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Indemnifying Party shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on
its indemnification responsibility contained in Sections 13.07 and 13.08.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof provided the Indemnifying Party does not
seek to assert any limitation on its indemnification responsibility to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall control such defense subject to the agreement of the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party to cooperate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim as provided below. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof or
assumes the defense but asserts any limitation on its obligation to indemnify
or defend which reduces its indemnification actions.



(c)If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim:



(i)the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of
such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 72 of 92

* * *



information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; and



(ii)the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party fully informed as
to the progress of the Third Party Claim, and the defense thereof, and provide
the Indemnified Party with copies of all correspondence relating to such
Third-Party Claim within five (5) Business Days of receiving or sending such
correspondence and otherwise keep the Indemnified Party fully informed of the
status of such Third-Party Claim.



(d)Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying
Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided,
however, such consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required in the
event of the entry of such judgment or entering into a settlement with respect
to such Third Party Claim does not include (i) the admission of any liability
or responsibility on behalf of the Indemnified Party, (ii) any financial
obligation to be paid by the Indemnified Party or (iii) any sanction or
restriction upon the conduct of any business of the Indemnified Party.



13.06 Losses Net of Insurance. The amount of any and all Losses under this
Article XIII and elsewhere under this Agreement shall be determined net of any
amounts that are recovered by an Indemnified Party under insurance policies
with respect to such Losses (other than self-insurance or insurance coverage
provided by any captive insurance company that is an Affiliate of the
Indemnified Party).



13.07 Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect
for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (except for those
contained in Sections 4.01 and 5.01 (Organization and Good Standing), Sections
4.02 and 5.02 (Authority), Sections 4.05 and 5.07 (Brokers), Section 4.07 and
5.05 (Compliance with Laws), Section 4.11 (Taxes) (the foregoing
representations hereinafter referred to as the "Fundamental Representations"),
which shall survive the Closing until the thirtieth (30th) day following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations), and until the resolution
of the indemnification Claims received by the Indemnifying Party in accordance
with the provisions hereof prior to the expiration of the relevant time
period. All covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement that by
their terms are to be performed at or prior to the Closing shall terminate one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, and all covenants and
obligations contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be
performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing until performed in
accordance with their terms.



A Claim shall be deemed to have been properly brought only upon delivery of a
Claim Notice to the other Party within the applicable time periods provided
above at the notice address set forth in Section 18.01. For the avoidance of
doubt, the initial date of delivery of a Claim Notice, and not the expiration
of any cure period, shall be deemed to be the date a Claim is made. Any Claim
required to be made within an applicable time period provided above that is
not so timely made shall be forever barred.

SHALL SEEK, AND AN ARBITRATOR APPOINTED UNDER ARTICLE XVII MAY NOT AWARD,
SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES
(INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE ("CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS
SECTION 13.08(a) SHALL NOT LIMIT A PARTY'S RIGHT TO (I) INDEMNIFICATION UNDER
THIS ARTICLE XIII FOR (A) ANY SUCH LOSSES TO THE EXTENT SUCH PARTY IS REQUIRED
TO PAY SUCH LOSSES TO A THIRD PARTY THAT IS NOT AN AFFILIATE OR REPRESENTATIVE
OF SUCH PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A MATTER FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE
ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE XIII, OR (B) FOR BREACHES (X)
OF SELLER'S OBLIGATION TO DELIVER THE REACTORS UNDER SECTION 2.06(B) OR (Y) OF
SECTION 18.15, OR (II) A CLAIM BY BUYER FOR THE MARGIN LOSS AMOUNT UNDER
SCHEDULE 2.06.



(b)Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the following limitations shall apply with regard to Seller's obligations to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 13.02:



(i)No Claim may be made against Seller for indemnification pursuant to Section
13.02(a) or Section 13.02(b) with respect to any individual action, occurrence
or event subject to the indemnifications thereunder (or group of related
actions, occurrences or events) unless (A) such individual action, occurrence
or event exceeds Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000) (the "Seller
Non-HSE De Minimis Amount") (and in such case, no Loss below the Seller De
Minimis Amount be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the
aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified Parties' Losses) or (B) such Claim
relates to the breach of a Fundamental Representation by Seller.



(ii)Seller shall not be liable to indemnify Buyer for any Claim pursuant to
Section 13.02(a) or Section 13.02(b) unless (A) Buyer has submitted Claim
Notices for such Claim as required by this Agreement, and (B) the aggregate
amount of all Claims and Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect
to Section 13.02(a) and Section 13.02(b) (excluding individual Claims and
Losses less than the applicable Seller Non-HSE De Minimis Amounts) shall
exceed an amount equal to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) ( the "Seller Non-
HSE Deductible Amount"), after which point Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against the full amount of
such aggregate Claims and Losses (excluding individual Claims and Losses that
are less than the Seller Non-HSE De Minimis Amount), provided, that the Seller
Non-HSE Deductible Amount shall not apply with respect to Losses arising under
Section 13.02(a) with respect to a breach of a Fundamental Representation by
Seller. For Claims not otherwise subject to indemnification as a result of the
Seller Non-HSE Deductible Amount, Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably aware of
the status of such Claims, include amounts expended in respect thereof.



(iii)Seller's liability to indemnify pursuant to Section 13.02(a) (other than
for breach or default of a Fundamental Representation by Seller) and Section

Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000) (the "Seller Non-HSE Indemnification

or event subject to the indemnifications thereunder (or group of related
actions, occurrences or events) unless (A) such individual action, occurrence
or event exceeds Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000) (the "Buyer
Non-HSE De Minimis Amount") (and in such case, no Loss below the Buyer De

indemnification as a result of the Buyer Non-HSE Deductible Amount, Seller
shall keep Buyer reasonably aware of the status of such Claims, include

13.09 Mitigation. The indemnification obligations of an Indemnifying Party
shall be appropriately reduced to the extent an Indemnified Party does not use
reasonable steps and use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any and
all Losses, it being understood and agreed that to the extent any Indemnified
Party undertakes such mitigation efforts, the costs of such efforts may be
included in the calculation of indemnifiable Losses hereunder.



13.10 Subrogation. In the event that an Indemnified Party has a right of
recovery against any third party non-insurers with respect to any Losses in
connection with which a payment is made to such Indemnified Party by an
Indemnifying Party; then (a) such Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of
such payment, be subrogated to all of the rights of recovery of such

TAXES

occupation, motor fuel, registration, value added, environmental and other
similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes), and any
other Taxes assessed or imposed in each case on the transfer or sale of the
Assets (including environmental Taxes on any petroleum products transferred)
and all costs to record any deeds will be borne equally by Buyer and Seller
(regardless of whether such Taxes are levied on Seller or Buyer). Subject to
the foregoing, the Party upon whom such Taxes are levied shall be responsible
for, and will file, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes and remit, upon the request of the other Party,
copies of the portions of such Tax Returns relevant to this Agreement and any
necessary documentation to the other Party. Each Party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Party in taking
advantage of any applicable exemptions that will eliminate or minimize any
otherwise applicable transfer Taxes imposed in connection with the purchase
and sale of the Assets.



14.02 Tax Refunds. Seller shall retain any Claim, right or interest in or to
any refund, rebate, abatement or other recovery of Taxes related to the period
prior to the Effective Time.



14.03 Real and Personal Property Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, the
Seller Companies' pro rata share of all ad valorem, real and personal property
Taxes arising from the ownership or use of the Assets for the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as
of the Effective Time regardless of when such ad valorem, real and personal
property Taxes are actually billed and payable, based on the most recent
statement of ad valorem, real and personal property Taxes which is available
at the time of Closing. The Seller Companies shall be responsible for



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 76 of 92

* * *



paying, and shall indemnify Buyer for, their pro rata share of all such ad
valorem, real and personal property Taxes relating to the period prior to the
Effective Time. Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify Seller
for, such Taxes relating to the period after the Effective Time. If there are
any special or general assessments on the Assets which are payable in
installments, Buyer shall be responsible for all installments which fall due
subsequent to the Effective Time. To the extent possible, prorations shall be
made on and as of the Closing Date; otherwise, the Parties shall make
prorations within ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date. Buyer
shall file, or cause to be filed, all required reports and returns incident to
all ad valorem Taxes, real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar
obligations, which reports and returns are due after the Closing Date and
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Taxing authorities all such Taxes
reflected on such reports or returns even if same are for periods prior to the

the Closing to agree upon an allocation of the Closing Date Payment (the "Tax
Allocation") in the form of Schedule 14.04, in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as
appropriate). The Parties shall treat and report (and, if necessary, to cause
each of their respective Affiliates to so treat and report) the sale and
purchase of the Assets for all federal, state and local Tax purposes in a
manner consistent with the Tax Allocation and shall not take any position on
their respective Tax Returns that is inconsistent with the Tax Allocation
(provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Parties
from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing authority
based upon or arising out of the Tax Allocation, and no Party shall be
required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Taxing authority challenging such Tax Allocation). Without limiting the
generality of the preceding sentence, the Tax Allocation will be reflected in
Form 8594 that will be filed by Seller and Buyer in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and in any other filings under the Code. The Parties
recognize that the Tax Allocation does not include Buyer's acquisition
expenses and that Buyer will allocate such expenses appropriately.



14.05 Tax Election. Either Party may elect to structure the conveyance,
transfer or assignment of all or an applicable portion of the Assets as a tax-
free exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code (a "1031 Exchange"),
provided that (a) such Party gives notice of such election to the other Party
in writing reasonably in advance of the Closing Date, (b) Buyer shall not be
required to take title to any other property and (c) such structure does not
have any adverse effect on the other Party (including, but not limited to,
delaying or affecting the Closing Date). If such an exchange is elected by
such Party (the "Electing Party"), the Parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts to execute all necessary 1031 Exchange documents (provided,
that any costs and expenses incurred shall be borne by the Electing Party)
that shall be in a form mutually acceptable to the Parties. The Electing Party
will indemnify the other Party and its Affiliates, employees and agents
against Losses that may be sustained by them on account of or in connection
with such election to structure the transaction as a 1031 Exchange. Neither
Party, by its consent to a 1031 Exchange, shall be responsible in any way for
the Electing Party's compliance with such 1031 Exchange.



14.06 Tax Assistance. After the Closing Date, each Party shall provide such
assistance as the other Party may from time to time reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of Tax Returns required to be filed, any audit
or other examination by any taxing authority, any judicial or administrative
Proceeding relating to liability for Taxes, or any claim for refund in respect
of such Taxes or in connection with any litigation and Proceedings or
liabilities related to the Assets, including making available employees for
interviews, litigation preparation and testimony. The requesting Party shall
reimburse the assisting Party for the out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
assisting Party. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes involving the
Assets and each shall execute and deliver such documents as are necessary to
carry out the intent of this Article XIV. Furthermore, Buyer and Seller agree
that for a period of five (5) years after

of limitations on assessment or refund, if longer than five (5) years, not to
destroy or otherwise dispose of any information provided by Seller to Buyer,

such Party shall first offer in writing to surrender such books, records and
other data to the other Party and such other Party shall agree in writing to
take possession thereof during the thirty (30) day period after such offer is
made.



14.07 Operating Taxes. Except as provided in this Article XIV, Buyer shall be
liable for and pay all Taxes that arise as result of the sale, rental, lease,
storage, use, consumption or operation of the Assets by Buyer after the

to this Article XIV, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Party shall be required at any time to disclose to the
other Party, or to any other Person, absent legal constraint, any Tax return
or other confidential Tax information.



14.09 Payments. Any payments made to any Party pursuant to this Article XIV
shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and

damages in excess of compensatory damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and
expenses of arbitration, and the arbitral panel is not empowered to and shall
not award exemplary, punitive, or similar damages in excess of compensatory
damages and attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses of arbitration.



(c)The arbitral panel is expressly empowered to grant any remedy or relief not
expressly prohibited herein available under Applicable Law, including specific
performance of this Agreement to the extent allowed by Applicable Law,
declaration of the validity, meaning, and effect of this Agreement and the
rights or duties of the Parties hereunder, and, to the extent allowed by
Applicable Law, prohibiting or mandating actions by a Party with respect to
the performance of this Agreement or matters arising out of or in connection
therewith.



(d)In its award, the arbitral panel may apportion the costs of arbitration
between or among the Parties in such manner as it deems reasonable, taking
into account the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Parties during
the proceedings, and the result of the arbitration, including requiring one
Party to bear all or the majority of such costs.



(e)In the event that any Party fails or refuses to participate in arbitration
as provided herein, the arbitral panel is authorized to determine whether the
failure to participate in the arbitration was due to the bad faith of a Party,
and if so may award to the other Party or Parties all costs associated with
the arbitration, including attorneys' fees and costs, arbitrator's fees, and
administrative fees.



(f)Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitral panel as part of its award, each
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and the costs of arbitration, and
the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and of any expert or other assistance
engaged by the arbitral panel shall be borne by the Parties to the arbitration
in equal shares.



17.07 Effect of Failure to Participate or to Pay Advances of Costs and Fees.



(a)The failure or refusal of any Party, having been given due notice thereof,
to participate at any stage of the dispute resolution proceedings shall not
prevent the proceedings from continuing, nor shall such failure or refusal
impair the validity of the award or cause the award to be void or voidable,
nor shall it be a basis for challenge of the validity or enforceability of the
award or of the arbitration proceedings.



(b)If any Party fails to timely pay an advance on fees and costs ordered by
the arbitral panel or the AAA within twenty (20) days after the date set for
such deposit, that Party shall be deemed to be in default. The arbitral panel
or the AAA shall then determine whether the funds on deposit are sufficient to
satisfy the anticipated estimated expenses for the proceeding to continue on
an expedited basis without the participation of the defaulting Party. If so,
the proceeding will continue without the participation of the defaulting
Party, and the Panel may enter an award on default. Prior to entering an award
on default, the arbitral panel shall require the non-defaulting Party to
produce such evidence and legal argument in support of its contentions as the
arbitral panel may deem appropriate. The arbitral panel may receive such
evidence and argument without the defaulting Party's presence or
participation. If the funds on deposit are deemed



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 84 of 92

* * *



insufficient to satisfy the estimated costs of continuing as provided herein,
the non-defaulting Party may make all or part of the requested deposit in an
amount sufficient to allow the proceeding to continue without the
participation of the defaulting Party. If the non-defaulting Party chooses not
to make the requested deposit, the arbitral panel may suspend or terminate the
proceedings.



17.08 Adherence to Time Limits.



(a)In accepting appointment, the arbitrator(s) shall commit that their
schedules permit them to devote the reasonably necessary time and attention to
the arbitration proceedings and to resolving the Dispute within the time
periods set by this Agreement and by the AAA Rules.



(b)Any time limits set out in this dispute resolution agreement or in the AAA
Rules may be modified upon written agreement of the Parties and the arbitral
panel or by order of the arbitral panel.



(c)Any failure of the arbitral panel to satisfy such time limits or to render
a final award within the time specified shall not impair the validity of the
award or cause the award to be void or voidable, nor shall it be a basis for
challenge of the validity or enforceability of the award or of the arbitration
proceedings.



17.09 Interim Measures from the Courts in Aid of Arbitration.



(a)At any time after submission of a written notice of arbitration, any Party
may request a court of competent jurisdiction to grant interim measures of
protection: (i) to preserve the status quo pending resolution of the Dispute;
(ii) to prevent the destruction of documents and other information or things
related to the Dispute; (iii) to prevent the transfer, dissipation, or hiding
of assets; and/or (iv) to aid the arbitral proceedings and the award. A
request for such interim measures to a judicial authority shall not be deemed
incompatible with or a waiver of a Party's right to arbitrate a Dispute.



(b)The Parties agree that a court at the seat of the arbitration at the
request of a Party, or the arbitral Panel with the consent of all Parties, may
consolidate two or more arbitral proceedings among the Parties if common
questions of law or fact exist.



17.10 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction
of the state and federal courts of New York for the enforcement of any award
rendered by the arbitral panel.

17.11 Confidentiality. Unless the Parties agree otherwise via a prior written
agreement, the Parties, the arbitrator(s), and the AAA shall treat the dispute
resolution proceedings provided for herein, any related disclosures, and the
decisions of the arbitral panel, as confidential, except in connection with
judicial proceedings ancillary to the dispute resolution proceedings, such as
a judicial challenge to, or enforcement of, the arbitral award, and unless
otherwise required by law to protect a legal right of a Party.



17.12 Survival. The terms of this Article XVII shall survive the termination
or expiration of this Agreement.

shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the
substantive and procedural laws of the State of New York, without regard to
the conflicts of laws principles of New York.

of its other Indemnified Parties), to the fullest extent permitted by

venue, residence or domicile. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any
such claim shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.



(c)TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH

IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN
WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS
AGREEMENT, THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR

SECTION 18.02(c) WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH
PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.



18.03 Publicity. No Party shall issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions hereunder without
obtaining the prior written approval of the other Party hereto, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of
the issuing Party disclosure is otherwise required by Applicable Law or the
rules or regulations of any securities exchange, whether in the United States
or elsewhere (or upon advice of counsel such release or announcement is
appropriate or desirable under or in light of such laws and regulations), in
which case the Party intending to make such release shall use commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with such Applicable Law to (x) consult in good
faith with, and with appropriate notice to, the other Party with respect to
the timing and content thereof (including giving due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith)
and (y) provide a copy thereof to the other Party prior to such issuance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to prepare a
joint press release to be issued on the Closing Date and, upon the request of
either Buyer or Seller, at the time of the signing of this Agreement.

18.04 Entire and Integrated Agreement.



(a)This Agreement, the Schedules, the Disclosure Letter and Exhibits and the
Closing Documents set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the
Parties in respect to the Contemplated Transactions and supersede all prior
agreements, arrangements and undertakings, whether written or oral, relating
to the subject matter hereof (including the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall terminate and be of no further force or effect as of the Execution
Date).



(b)The Parties have agreed to enter into or deliver the Closing Documents
contemporaneously with the Closing. The Parties would not have executed this
Agreement had the Parties not also agreed to execute or deliver, as
applicable, the Closing Documents at the Closing. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Closing Documents are not stand-alone agreements, but are
rather interrelated agreements that are inextricably intertwined. The Parties
agree that if the Closing occurs and subsequent thereto a Party or its
Affiliates, as applicable, becomes a debtor or debtor-in-possession in a case
under the Bankruptcy Code, the Closing Documents will be assumed or rejected
under 11 U.S.C. §365 as one integrated whole and the Closing Documents shall
not be severable for purposes of assumption or rejection, unless the Parties
agree otherwise. The Parties' rights under 11 U.S.C. §365 are preserved.



18.05 Assignment.



(a)This Agreement and the Closing Documents (excluding the Commercial
Agreements which shall be governed as provided therein) and, except as
otherwise provided in Article IX with respect to the Intellectual Property,
any rights and obligations hereunder or thereunder shall not be assignable or
transferable by Buyer or Seller without the prior written consent of the other
Party and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void and
without effect. Without limiting the generality of the preceding, the
indemnification Obligations of Seller and Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and
the Closing Documents (excluding the Commercial Agreements) shall not be
transferable or assignable in whole or in part without the other Party's prior
written consent and any purported or attempted transfer or assignment by an
Indemnifying Party shall be null and void without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing of this Section 18.05(a),
(i) Seller may assign or transfer any or all of its rights hereunder to any
qualified intermediary to complete a 1031 Exchange as contemplated in Section
14.05, provided that Seller provides a guaranty of the assignee's obligations
in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in its sole discretion, and (ii)
without relieving Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement (including any
indemnities or in respect of the Assumed Liabilities) and provided that if the
assignment occurs prior to Closing Buyer has delivered a Letter of Direction
to Seller at least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may
transfer or assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to an
Affiliate of Buyer that is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by PBF Energy
Inc.



(b)Without limiting the provisions of Sections ý18.05(a) or otherwise
relieving the Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement (unless
otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Seller), following the Closing, in
the event either Party, in any transaction or series of transactions, sells,
transfers, assigns, conveys, exchanges or otherwise disposes or leases to a
third party all or substantially all of its assets, then, in connection with,
as a condition to, and no later than the consummation of such transaction,
such Party shall cause the applicable acquirer to expressly assume the Party's
Obligations under this Agreement (including in the case of Buyer, the Assumed
Liabilities and in the case of Seller, the Retained Liabilities) and the
Closing Documents (excluding the Commercial Agreements) by joinder or other
documentation reasonably satisfactory to the other Party.

18.06 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded or canceled, and any of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument
executed by the Parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by or on behalf of the
Party waiving compliance. The failure of any Party at any time or times to
require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the
right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by any Party of any
condition, or of any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or
breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other term,
covenant representation or warranty.



18.07 Expenses. Whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are consummated,
and except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, including legal, due diligence, accounting and investment
banking fees and expenses, shall be paid by the Party incurring such costs or
expenses.

18.08 Schedules and Disclosure Letter. Matters listed once on the Schedules or
the Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with reference to all sections
of the Schedules or the Disclosure Letter (including any disclosures made in
amendments made pursuant to Section 6.03) to the extent the applicability of
such information is readily apparent. The listing (or inclusion of a copy) of
a document or other item in the Disclosure Letter shall be adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein if the
nature and relevance of such exception is readily apparent from the listing
(or inclusion of a copy) of such document. The inclusion of information in the
Schedules or the Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as an admission that
such information is material to the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or Seller.
In addition, matters reflected in the Schedules or the Disclosure Letter are
not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected
in such Schedules or the Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature.



18.09 Legal Representation.



(a)Buyer and Seller acknowledge that each of them has been represented by
counsel in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the Party
that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived.



(b)To the extent that communications between Seller or its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Baker Botts, L.L.P. and/or the firm of Alvarado Smith, each as
external legal counsel of Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, "Seller's
External Counsel"), on the other hand, relate to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions (the "Transaction Engagement"), such communications
shall (i) be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
Seller and not the Assets, (ii) not pass and become an Asset following Closing
and from and after Closing none of Buyer or any Person purporting to act on
behalf of or through Buyer will seek to obtain such communications by any
process. Accordingly, Buyer shall not have access to any such communications,
or to the files of Seller's External Counsel to the extent that they relate to
the Transaction Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing: (w)
Buyer waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to
any communication between Seller's External Counsel and Seller or its
Affiliates occurring prior to the Closing in connection with the Transaction
Engagement, (x) Seller and Seller's External Counsel shall be the sole holders
of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Transaction Engagement,
and none of the Assets or Buyer shall be a holder thereof, (y) to the extent
that files of Seller's External Counsel in respect of the Transaction
Engagement constitute property of the client, only Seller shall hold such
property rights, and (z) Seller's External



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 89 of 92

* * *



Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-
client communications or files to Buyer by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Seller's External Counsel and the Assets or otherwise.



(c)Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, further covenants and agrees
that each shall not assert any Claim against Seller's External Counsel in
respect of legal services provided by Seller's External Counsel in connection
with the Transaction Engagement.



(d)Each of the Parties consents to the arrangements in this Section 18.09 and
waives any actual or potential conflict of interest that may be involved in
connection with any representation by Seller's External Counsel permitted
hereunder.



18.10 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under Applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such
provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof.



18.11 Bulk Transfer Laws. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the
provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the purchase and sale of the Assets. Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold Buyer harmless (subject to Article XIII) from any Losses that
Buyer may incur due to failure to so comply in accordance with Section
13.02(d).



18.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided with respect to
indemnification for Indemnified Parties as set forth in Article XIII and
elsewhere in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights
upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.



18.13 Binding Effect. Subject to the provisions hereof restricting assignment,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.



18.14 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence with regard to all dates and
time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.



18.15 Confidentiality.



(a)Each of Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and each of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives) acknowledges that the information
and material, in whatever form, including this Agreement and the Closing
Documents (collectively, the "Confidential Information") disclosed or made
available to it by, and relating to, the other (and its Affiliates) prior to
the Effective Time is confidential. Each of Seller and Buyer (on behalf of
themselves and each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives)
further agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to make
or permit disclosure of the Confidential Information to any Person, other than
their Affiliates and their respective Representatives (including collective
bargaining representatives) to whom such disclosure is necessary or convenient
for the completion of the Contemplated Transactions (including compliance with
the terms and condition of any Material Contract), and except in an
arbitration proceeding as described in Article XVII or as may be required by
Applicable Law or a court of competent jurisdiction. Each of Seller and Buyer
(and their respective Affiliates) shall appropriately notify each
Representative to whom any such disclosure is made that such disclosure is
made in confidence and shall be kept in confidence and shall not be used in
any capacity except for the operations of



Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 90 of 92

* * *



the Assets by Buyer. During the Interim Period, Seller and Buyer will
cooperate in establishing "clean teams" where required or advisable in order
to facilitate the review of Confidential Information that is competitively
sensitive and that may be reasonably necessary for due diligence, transition,
or integration purposes.



(b)Each of Seller and Buyer (and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives) agrees to use diligent efforts in accordance with customary
and reasonable commercial practice, and at least with the same degree of skill
and care that it would manifest in protection of its own confidential
information, to protect the Confidential Information.



(c)Each of the Parties (on behalf of themselves and each of their respective
Affiliates and Representatives) agrees to notify the other Party promptly, in
the event that it becomes aware of the unauthorized possession or use of the
Confidential Information (or any part thereof) by any third Person, including
any of its Representatives. Each of Seller and Buyer (and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives) agrees to cooperate with the other Party in
connection with the other Party's efforts to terminate or prevent such
unauthorized possession or use of its Confidential Information.



(d)Each of Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and each of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives) acknowledges that the other will
suffer injury for which the other will not have an adequate remedy at law, in
the event of a breach of the provisions of this Section 18.15, and that the
other shall be entitled to injunctive relief as is reasonably necessary to
prevent or curtail such breach, whether actual or threatened; provided, that,
in no event (including a willful breach of this Agreement by Seller or Buyer,
respectively) shall Seller or Buyer (or their respective Affiliates and
Representatives) be prevented from exercising all of the rights granted to it
hereunder.



(e)Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the obligations of each of Seller and Buyer (and their respective Affiliates
and Representatives) to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information (each in such capacity a "Receiving Party") shall not apply to any
portion of the Confidential Information that:



(i)is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of the
Receiving Party, including information in the public domain;



(ii)the Receiving Party receives from a third party without any requirement to
keep such information secret;



(iii)the Receiving Party can prove was in its possession without any
obligation of secrecy at the time of its disclosure; or



(iv)the Receiving Party develops independently of and without reference to or
use of the Confidential Information.



(f)Buyer shall not use (and shall be responsible in the event any of its
Representatives use) the Confidential Information prior to the Closing for any
other purpose other than the evaluation of the Contemplated Transactions.









Sale and Purchase Agreement

Page 91 of 92

* * *



(g)In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Section
18.15 and the confidentiality provisions of any Closing Document, the
provisions of any Closing Document shall control with respect to any matters
addressed by such Closing Document.



(h)In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, at the request of
Seller, Buyer shall within twenty (20) days after receiving such request
return to Seller all written Confidential Information, including all
photocopies of the same, or certify to Seller that such Confidential
Information has been destroyed.



(i)The provisions of this Section 18.15 shall remain in force for a period of
five (5) years from the later of the Execution Date or the Closing Date. The
terms of this Section 18.15 shall survive the termination or expiration of
this Agreement.



(j)The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or
effect as of the Execution Date.



(k)If the Closing occurs, Seller agrees to treat information it possesses
concerning the historical operation of the Assets as Confidential Information.



(l)Seller and Buyer do not intend for any obligations of confidentiality
contained herein to limit disclosure of the transaction in any way that would
cause it to be treated as a "confidential transaction" under Treasury
Regulation 1.6011-4(b)(3).



18.16 Electronic Signatures. Notwithstanding the Electronic Signatures in
Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001 et. seq.), the Uniform
Electronic Transactions Act, or any other Applicable Law relating to or
enabling the creation, execution, delivery, or recordation of any Contract or
signature by electronic means, and notwithstanding any course of conduct
engaged in by the Parties, no Party shall be deemed to have executed this
Agreement or other document contemplated thereby (including any amendment or
other change thereto) unless and until such Party shall have executed this
Agreement or other document on paper by a handwritten original signature or
any other symbol executed or adopted by a Party with current intention to
authenticate this Agreement or such other document contemplated. Delivery of a
copy of this Agreement or such other document bearing an original signature by
facsimile transmission (whether directly from one facsimile device to another
by means of a dial-up connection or whether mediated by the worldwide web), by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, shall have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature. "Originally signed" or
"original signature" means or refers to a signature that has not been
mechanically or electronically reproduced.



18.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in one or
more counterparts (including by means of signature pages delivered by
facsimile transmission or electronic mail), all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more such
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Party. Facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission of any signed
original document or retransmission of any signed facsimile or scanned and
emailed transmission will be deemed the same as delivery of an original. At
the request of any Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile or scanned and
emailed transmission by signing a duplicate original document.

2.02 Determination and Payment of Annual Earn Out Payments. Subject to the
provisions of this Schedule 2.06, Buyer shall be obligated to make additional
payments to Seller (each an "Annual Earn Out Payment", and collectively, the
"Earn Out Payments") to the extent provided pursuant to this Section 2.02:

(a) Term. The measurement period for the Earn Out Payments (the "Term") shall
end on the earlier to occur of (i) the fourth (4th) anniversary of the
commencement of the first Annual Earn Out Period, as defined below, and (ii)
the date that the termination in either Section 2.02(b)(v)(B) or 2.02(b)(v)(C)
of this Schedule 2.06 occurs. The Term shall be divided into up to four (4)
successive twelve calendar month periods (each an "Annual Earn Out Period" and
collectively, the "Earn Out Period") commencing (x) at the Effective Time if
the Closing is on the first day of a calendar month; or (y) at 12:01 A.M.
local time on the first day of the calendar month following the Closing Date,
if the Closing is not on the first day of a calendar month. As used herein,
the term "calendar month" shall consist of the period from 12:00 A.M. local
time on the first day of each calendar month until 11:59 P.M. on the last day
of such month.

(b) Calculation of Annual Earn Out Amounts; Coker Drum Amount, Turnaround
Amounts and Margin Loss Amount. For each Annual Earn Out Period during the
Term, Buyer will pay Seller an Annual Earn Out Payment, if any, as calculated
using the following formula:

(i) Annual Earn Out Amount. The Annual Earn Out Amount for each Annual Earn
Out Period shall be calculated using the following formula:

"Annual Earn Out Amount" = ((Annual EBITDA Amount + Margin Loss Amount - the
Annual Earn Out Threshold Amount) * 50%) - Annual Setoff Amount.

If the resulting calculation is equal to or less than zero dollars ($0) for an
Annual Earn Out Period, then no Annual Earn Out Payment shall be due to Seller
for such Annual Earn Out Period,

EXCLUDED INFORMATION HAS BEEN MARKED AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACES AS FOLLOWS:

and the resulting amount (if negative) shall not be carried over to any
subsequent Annual Earn Out Period. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
the Annual EBITDA Amount for any Annual Earn Out Period does not exceed the
Annual Earn Out Threshold Amount then such deficit shall not be carried over
to any subsequent Annual Earn Out Period.

(ii) Annual Setoff Amount. After the Closing Date, certain set off amounts may
apply against each Annual Earn Out Amount, with the Annual Setoff Amount for
each Annual Earn Out Period calculated as follows:

"Annual Setoff Amount" = Coker Drums Amount (to the extent not otherwise
reimbursed) + Turnarounds Amount (to the extent not otherwise reimbursed) +
Margin Loss Amount

where,

(A)Coker Drums Amount. At Buyer's election, (x) upon Seller's receipt from
Buyer of supporting documentation, which documentation shall be provided no
earlier than the end of the quarter in which the expenditures were made,
Seller shall pay Buyer pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(x) of this Schedule 2.06 or
(y) Buyer may credit against the Annual Earn Out Amounts for the Annual Earn
Out Periods which cover calendar years [*****], as applicable, up to a maximum
aggregate amount of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) for the actual third
party costs incurred and paid for by Buyer (including customary transportation
costs) in the calendar years [*****]for purchasing two (2) new coker drums for
the Refinery (the "Coker Drums") (with the amount of such credit being the
"Coker Drums Amount"); provided, however that if, as of the end of the
applicable quarter, Buyer's good faith estimate of the Annual Earn Out Amount
for the applicable Annual Earn Out Period indicates that Seller will receive
an Earn Out Payment sufficient to cover the Coker Drums Amount, Buyer will not
have the right to elect to be reimbursed pursuant to clause (x). The aggregate
Coker Drums Amounts shall not exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000). Any
such costs of the Coker Drums in excess of Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000) shall be for the account of Buyer and not included in the Coker
Drums Amounts. The Coker Drums Amounts will not include any other costs,
including costs associated with the design, installation, testing, or
commissioning of the new Coker Drums or removal of the old coker drums. For
example, the Annual Earn Out Amount for the Annual Earn Out Period for [*****]
can be reduced, at Buyer's election, for such Coker Drum purchase expenses
which Buyer pays in [*****], but not to exceed the aggregate amount for all
Coker Drums Amounts of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000).

(B)Turnarounds Amount. At Buyer's election, (x) upon Seller's receipt from
Buyer of supporting documentation, which documentation shall be provided no
earlier than the end of the quarter in which the expenditures were made,
Seller shall pay Buyer pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(x) of this Schedule 2.06 or
(y) Buyer may credit, at Buyer's election, against the Annual Earn Out Amount
for the Annual Earn Out Period which covers [*****]the amount of expenses
incurred by Buyer on or before [*****]and capitalized pursuant to GAAP (the
"Turnarounds Amount") for the [*****] turnarounds at the Refinery described on
Schedule 2.06B (collectively, the "[*****] Turnaround"). Any cost of the
[*****] Turnaround in excess of the budgeted amount in Schedule 2.06B shall be
for the account of Buyer and shall be excluded from the Turnarounds Amount.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Turnarounds Amount shall not exceed the
budgeted amount in Schedule 2.06B for the [*****] Turnaround. 

CERTAIN IDENTIFIED INFORMATION HAS BEEN EXCLUDED BECAUSE SUCH INFORMATION (i)
IS NOT MATERIAL AND (ii) WOULD BE COMPETITIVELY HARMFUL IF PUBLICLY DISCLOSED.
EXCLUDED INFORMATION HAS BEEN MARKED AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACES AS FOLLOWS:
[*****].



(C)Margin Loss Amount. The Annual Earn Out Amount and the Annual Setoff Amount
for any Annual Earn Out Period that includes time on or before [*****] shall
be adjusted for Margin Loss (to the extent there is any) in such applicable
Annual Earn Out Period arising from the [*****] Turnaround conducted during
such Annual Earn Out Period (the amount of such applicable Margin Loss being
the "Margin Loss Amount"). Buyer shall take reasonable mitigation actions to
minimize or eliminate Margin Loss, measured against normal operations and the
costs, if any, of such mitigation that are not otherwise included in the
Margin Loss shall be incorporated into the Margin Loss Amount calculation
(such costs being the "Mitigation Costs"). The Margin Loss Amount will not
include any Margin Loss to the extent due to irregularities in non-[*****]
Turnaround units or units (other than the [*****] Turnaround units) that Buyer
takes offline or into turnaround. The amount of Margin Loss to be included in
the Margin Loss Amount will be capped at $800,000 per day for the [*****]
Turnaround, as limited by the number of days budgeted for the [*****]
Turnaround on Schedule 2.06B.

(iii) Margin Loss True-Up Amount. After each Annual Earn Out Period that
includes time on or before [*****], Seller shall pay Buyer an amount (the
"Margin Loss True-up Amount") equal to the Margin Loss Amounts less the setoff
for Margin Loss Amount actually used as credits against and reducing the
Annual Earn Out Amounts. For example, if for [*****], the Margin Loss Amount
equals $8 million but only $6 million of such setoff amount is actually used
as a credit against and reduces the Annual Earn Out Amount then the Margin
Loss True-Up Amount shall be $2 million. The Margin Loss True-Up Amount, if
applicable, shall be paid pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(viii) of this Schedule
2.06.

(iv) Limitations.

Notwithstanding anything in this Schedule 2.06 to the contrary:

(A) Subject to clause (C) below, the Annual Earn Out Payment for each Annual
Earn Out Period shall not exceed the Annual Earn Out Cap for such period. In
the event an Annual Earn Out Payment is limited by the preceding sentence,
then the amount by which the Annual Earn Out Amount exceeds the Annual Earn
Out Cap for such period shall not be carried to any other Annual Earn Out
Period or included in the calculation of any other Annual Earn Out Amount.

(B) The Maximum Earn Out Amount shall not apply during either of the first two
(2) Annual Earn Out Periods or the Annual Earn Out Payments associated with
such periods, but the Term shall expire at the end of the second (2nd) Annual
Earn Out Period if the aggregate amount of the Earn Out Payments paid to
Seller during the first (1st) and the second (2nd) Annual Earn Out Periods
exceeds, in the aggregate, the Maximum Earn Out Amount.

(C) If the Term continues into the third (3rd) Annual Earn Out Period or
fourth (4th) Annual Earn Out Period, then in no event shall the aggregate of
Earn Out Payments paid to Seller in such Earn Out Periods (when added to the
then Prior Earn Out Payments) exceed the Maximum Earn Out Amount. If the
Annual Earn Out Amount due to Seller with respect to the third (3rd) or the
fourth (4th) Annual Earn Out Period (when added to the then Prior Earn Out
Payments) would cause the total of all Earn Out Payments to exceed the Maximum
Earn Out Amount, then the Annual Earn Out Amount for such Annual Earn Out

Period shall be that amount which, when added to the then Prior Earn Out
Payments, causes the total of all Earn Out Payments to equal the Maximum Earn
Out Amount, in which case the Term shall expire upon the payment of such
amount.

(D) The Annual Setoff Amount shall not include any costs or margin loss
associated with the period prior to the Closing Date (i.e., if the [*****]
Turnaround is completed prior to the Closing Date, then no Turnaround Amount
or Margin Loss Amount shall be recovered for the [*****] Turnaround).

(E) Any amount of a Coker Drums Amount, Turnarounds Amount or Margin Loss
Amount claimed in one Annual Earn Out Period's Annual Setoff Amount may not be
claimed or duplicated in any future Annual Earn Out Amount.

(F) Notwithstanding anything in this Schedule 2.06 to the contrary, "Plant
Revenue" and the "Annual EBITDA Amount" shall (i) exclude sales to an
Affiliate of Buyer, and assets/plants/facilities owned, controlled or leased
by Buyer or Affiliates of Buyer, to the extent that such sales are made on
terms or conditions, including without limitation, prices that are less
favorable than the terms and conditions which could be obtained from
independent parties in arm's-length transactions ("Affiliate Products"), and
(ii) to the extent such a sale of an Affiliate Product is excluded, shall
include the first sale to an independent party of any such Affiliate Product
from an Affiliate of Buyer, or assets/plants/facilities owned, controlled or
leased by Buyer or Affiliates of Buyer.

(v) Mass Loss Threshold Condition.

(A) Seller may notify Buyer on or prior to Closing that Seller has solved the
Mass Loss issues at the Refinery by providing a report, including sufficient
specific details regarding such resolution such that Buyer may conduct its own
due diligence ("Seller's Report"), establishing that the absolute value of the
Mass Loss at the Effective Time is less than or equal to the absolute value of
the Mass Loss Threshold and will be for at least the next two years after the
Closing Date, then, subject to the absolute value of the Mass Loss in the
applicable Annual Earn Out Period as calculated in good faith by Buyer
actually being less than or equal to the absolute value of the Mass Loss
Threshold (excluding any Mass Loss unrelated to the matters identified as
being resolved in Seller's Report but including the historical Mass Loss level
for the Refinery), the Annual Earn Out Threshold for the first two Annual Earn
Out Periods shall be reduced to Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars
($250,000,000). Any such reduction shall not apply to the third or fourth
Annual Earn Out Periods, for which the Annual Earn Out Threshold Amount shall
remain Two Hundred Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($275,000,000). For the
avoidance of any doubt, if Seller's Report is proven to be inaccurate,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Annual Earn Out Threshold
shall be Two Hundred Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($275,000,000) for all
Annual Earn Out Periods.

(B) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, if Seller has provided
Buyer the Seller's Report, Buyer may request that an independent engineer be
selected in accordance with sub-clause (D) below (the "Independent Engineer")
confirm the accuracy of Seller's Report. If the Independent Engineer shall
confirm that Seller's Report is accurate, then the reduction in the Annual
Earn Out Threshold specified in sub-clause (A) above shall apply if the
conditions set forth therein are met, and if the Independent Engineer shall be

unable to so confirm Seller's Report then no such reduction shall apply. If
Buyer should fail to submit such matter to an Independent Engineer pursuant to
the foregoing by the specified deadline then Seller's Statement shall be final
and binding for purposes of sub-clause (A) above and the reduction specified
in sub-clause (A) shall apply if the conditions are met. Seller's Report is
solely being made for purposes of this Section 2.02(b)(v) of this Schedule
2.06 and is not, nor shall it be construed as, a representation, warranty or
covenant as to the performance or Operation of the Refinery, including in
respect of Mass Loss, that Buyer may experience from and after Closing

(C) If an Independent Engineer is requested by Buyer, then each Party will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Engineer any material
such Party deems relevant to the determination. The Independent Engineer shall
only decide the question of the accuracy of Seller's Statement made pursuant
to sub-clause (A) above. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Engineer
shall have no authority to interpret the legal provisions of the Agreement or
this Schedule 2.06 except the question of whether Seller's Statement is
reasonably accurate.

(D) Selection of Independent Engineer.

(1) If pursuant to sub-clause (B) above, Buyer determines to submit Seller's
Statement to an Independent Engineer, then Buyer shall notify Seller and the
Parties shall then endeavor to agree on a firm or individual to act as the
Independent Engineer.

(2) If either (i) after ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt by
Seller of notice from Buyer regarding the submission of the question of the
accuracy of Seller's Statement to an Independent Engineer in accordance with
sub-clause (B) above, Seller and Buyer have failed to agree upon the identity
of the Independent Engineer, or (ii) Seller and Buyer have agreed upon an
Independent Engineer, but the Independent Engineer has notified Seller or
Buyer that it is unwilling or unable to serve as the Independent Engineer,
then within the earlier of fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of such
ten (10) Business Days Period or after such notice by the proposed Independent
Engineer (the "IE Nomination Deadline"), Seller and Buyer shall each select a
candidate for the Independent Engineer and the two candidates so selected
shall promptly select a third independent firm or individual which shall be
appointed as the Independent Engineer. If a Party fails to select an
Independent Engineer by the IE Nomination Deadline, then the candidate
Independent Engineer selected by the other Party (provided it made such
nomination by the IE Nomination Deadline) shall be the Independent Engineer
for purposes of this Schedule 2.06. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties,
the Independent Engineer shall not otherwise be a current or recent (with last
6 months) provider of services to a Party.

(3) Upon an Independent Engineer being agreed or selected under the foregoing
sub-clause (D)(2), Seller and Buyer shall together jointly notify such
Independent Engineer of the selection and shall request the Independent
Engineer within ten (10) Business Days to confirm in writing whether it
accepts such appointment.

IS NOT MATERIAL AND (ii) WOULD BE COMPETITIVELY HARMFUL IF PUBLICLY DISCLOSED.

(4) If, following notification pursuant to sub-clause (D)(3) above, such
Independent Engineer shall not have confirmed its acceptance of such
appointment within the said period of fifteen (15) Business Days, then (unless
the Parties are able to mutually agree upon the appointment of another
Independent Engineer) the matter may again be referred in the manner aforesaid
under sub-clause (D)(2) above to make a further selection and the process
shall be repeated until an Independent Engineer is found who accepts
appointment.

(D) Fees of the Independent Engineer. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Engineer shall be borne by the Party whose position with respect to the
accuracy of the Seller's Statement does not prevail as determined by the
Independent Engineer.

(E) Determination by Independent Engineer. The Independent Engineer shall make
a written determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or
such other time as the Parties shall agree in writing) after its engagement.
The Independent Engineer's determination in respect of Seller's Statement
shall be final, binding and non-appealable upon each Party hereto and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction, barring fraud
or manifest error, in which case the decision will be referred back to the
Independent Engineer for correction, and shall be in substitution for and
precludes the bringing of any Proceedings by either Party, including in any
court, in connection with any dispute under this Schedule 2.06.

(c) Annual Earn Out Calculation Statement and Review.

(i) Auditor. Following the Closing Date, Seller shall engage a third party
accounting firm of Seller's choosing (the "Auditor") to represent and act on
Seller's behalf for purposes of this Schedule 2.06 (including any of the
reviews, audits and examinations described in this Section 2.02(c) of this
Schedule 2.06), at Seller's cost and expense.

(ii) Annual Earn Out Calculation Statement. As soon as practicable after the
end of each Annual Earn Out Period, and in any event prior to sixty (60) days
after the end of each Annual Earn Out Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to the Auditor a written statement (the "Annual Earn Out Calculation
Statement") setting forth (A) the Consolidated Income Statement for such
Annual Earn Out Period and (B) the calculation (in each case, an "Earn Out
Calculation") of each Computed Amount for such Annual Earn Out Period. To the
extent that the Earn Out Calculations include any Annual Setoff Amount, then
Buyer shall include with the Earn Out Calculation provided to the Auditor
sufficient supporting receipts and documentation (the "Earn Out Calculation
Supporting Documentation") for the Auditor to verify the amounts claimed by
Buyer as part of such Annual Setoff Amount. To the extent such information
received by Auditor pursuant to this provision constitutes Buyer CSI (defined
below), Auditor shall not provide such information to Seller; provided that
the Auditor shall be permitted to advise Seller on whether Auditor believes
Buyer owes any amounts to Seller pursuant to this Schedule 2.06, whether
Seller should file an Earn Out Calculation Objection Notice and the
information required for such a notice pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(iv) of this
Schedule 2.06.

(iii) Examination and Review. Auditor, on behalf of Seller, shall have sixty
(60) days after receipt of the Annual Earn Out Calculation Statement for each
Annual Earn Out Period and all applicable supporting documentation (in each
case, the "Review Period") to review the Annual Earn

Out Calculation Statement, the Earn Out Calculations set forth therein, and
the Earn Out Calculation Supporting Documentation.

(iv) Earn Out Calculation Objection Notice. Prior to the expiration of the
Review Period (subject to Section 2.02(c)(v) of this Schedule 2.06), Seller
may object to the Earn Out Calculations set forth in the Annual Earn Out
Calculation Statement for the applicable Annual Earn Out Period by delivering
a written notice of objection (an "Earn Out Calculation Objection Notice") to
Buyer. Any Earn Out Calculation Objection Notice shall specify the items in
the applicable Annual Earn Out Calculation Statement disputed by Seller and
Seller's reasons for the basis for such objection, as well as the amount in
dispute. If Seller fails to deliver an Earn Out Calculation Objection Notice
to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period (subject to Section
2.02(c)(v) of this Schedule 2.06), then the Annual Earn Out Calculations for
the Annual Earn Out Period set forth in the Earn Out Calculation Statement
shall be final and binding on the Parties to the extent of information
disclosed by Buyer to Seller pursuant to the Annual Earn Out Calculation
Statement.

(v) Audit. Upon Seller's request, Buyer shall permit the Auditor to conduct an
audit of Buyer's and its Affiliates' books and records, and question and
interview Buyer's and its Affiliates' personnel in respect of any Earn Out
Period in connection with Seller's review of the applicable Annual Earn Out
Calculation Statement, at Seller's cost and expense; provided that Seller
shall provide notice to Buyer of any such audit (such notice to be provided
within forty-five (45) days following receipt by Seller of the Annual Earn Out
Calculation Statement for such year) and such audit activities shall not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Refinery. As part of such
Audit, the Auditor shall have the right to inspect Buyer's (and any applicable
Affiliates') books, records and question and interview Buyer's (and any
applicable Affiliates') personnel during normal business hours at Buyer's
offices, upon reasonable prior notice. Notwithstanding anything in this
Sections 2.02(c) of this Schedule 2.06 to the contrary, in the event Seller
elects to conduct an audit as provided above for any Annual Earn Out Period,
then the Review Period for such Earn Out Period shall be extended until ten
(10) days after such audit is completed.

(vi) Separate Records/Financial Statements.

(A) Buyer and its Affiliates shall maintain separate books and records for the
Refinery in accordance with GAAP and in such detail as consistent with its
existing refinery subsidiaries as to enable Seller to adequately audit the
Refinery's performance under the provisions of this Schedule 2.06 and the
calculations required hereunder in accordance with Section 2.02(c)(ii) of this
Schedule 2.06.

(B) Buyer will promptly deliver to the Auditor copies of the annual audited
consolidated financial statements and the quarterly unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Refinery, if applicable, delivered to any lender
or any representative of any lender pursuant to the terms and provisions of
any agreement or instrument governing or creating any material indebtedness of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates but shall not otherwise be obligated to provide
such financial statements to Seller otherwise.

(C) Buyer shall deliver to Seller's Receiving Representatives (defined below)
within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, Buyer's good
faith estimate of (1) the Annual Earn Out Amount for the applicable Annual
Earn Out Period, and (2) any Annual Setoff Amount for the applicable Annual
Earn Out Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may use such information
for purposes of quarterly impairment testing.

(vi) Resolution of Disputes. If Seller delivers an Earn Out Calculation
Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller shall promptly thereafter negotiate in good
faith after delivery of such notice in an attempt to resolve the disputed
items and agree upon the Computed Amounts and the resulting Annual Earn Out
Payment for the applicable Annual Earn Out Period. As part of the resolution
of such disputed items, Buyer agrees that Seller's Receiving Representatives
may receive and/or be exposed to Buyer CSI (and the Auditor may share with
Seller's Receiving Representatives Buyer CSI previously shared with the
Auditor) and use such Buyer CSI for purposes of analyzing and making arguments
in respect of disputed items and resolving such disputed items (including any
Disputed Amount before the Independent Accountant, as discussed below). If
Buyer and Seller fail to reach an agreement with respect to all matters set
forth in the Earn Out Calculation Objection Notice within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Earn Out Calculation Objection Notice, then any
amounts remaining in dispute (the "Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so
disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts") may be submitted by a Party for resolution
to the office of an independent accountant who (A) shall be selected in
accordance with Section 2.02(c)(vii) of this Schedule 2.06 (the "Independent
Accountant") (B) act as experts and not arbitrators, and (C) shall resolve the
Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Annual Earn Out Payment.
The Parties agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to
materiality. Seller and Buyer shall each submit their proposed Computed
Amounts to the Independent Accountant. Each Party will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Independent Accountant any material such Party
deems relevant to the determination. The Independent Accountant shall only
decide the specific items under dispute by the Parties and their decision for
each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such
item in the Annual Earn Out Calculation Statement and the Earn Out Calculation
Objection Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall
have no authority to interpret the legal provisions of the Agreement or this
Schedule 2.06 except for the calculation of the Computed Amounts and
definitions contained (whether directly or indirectly) therein.

(vii) Selection of Independent Accountant.

(A) If a Party determines to submit a Disputed Amount to an Independent
Accountant for resolution, then such Party shall notify the other Party and
the Parties shall then endeavor to agree on an independent, internationally
recognized firm of accountants to act as the Independent Accountant. The
Auditor cannot be the Independent Accountant.

(B) If either (i) after ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt by the
non-submitting Party of notice from the submitting Party regarding the
submission of any remaining Disputed Amounts to an Independent Accountant in
accordance with Section 2.02(c)(vii) of this Schedule 2.06, Seller and Buyer
have failed to agree upon the identity of the Independent Accountant, or (ii)
Seller and Buyer have agreed upon an Independent Accountant, but the
Independent Accountant has notified Seller or Buyer that it is unwilling or
unable to serve as the Independent Accountant, then within the earlier of
