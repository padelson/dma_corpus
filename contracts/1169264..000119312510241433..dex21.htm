AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as hereinafter
defined) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company. Following the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the later of (x) the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver of those conditions), and (y) two (2) Business Days after the final day
of the Marketing Period or such earlier date as may be specified by Parent on
no less than two (2) Business Days prior notice to  the Company, at the offices of Alston and Bird LLP, 950 F Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20004, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in
writing by Parent and Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3  _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, Company shall
file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of
State_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL,
and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make any and
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as Parent and Company shall agree in writing and
shall specify in the Certificate of Merger, provided that such date and time
shall be on or after the time of filing of the Certificate of Merger and no
later than the second Business Day after the Closing Date (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) Subject to Section 5.8, at the Effective Time the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be
identical to the certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub, except that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Syniverse Holdings, Inc.";
and

(b) The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to
be identical to the bylaws of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, in each case, until thereafter amended in accordance with
the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_.

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified.

(b) The officers of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or approved and qualified.

 



2 ARTICLE II 

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1  _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Company, Parent,
or Merger Sub:

 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Company (such
shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b), (ii) any Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter
defined)), and (iii) the Shares described in Section 2.1(d)) shall thereupon
be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive $31.00 in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) Each Share held by Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation (a " _Surviving Corporation Share_ ").

(d) Each Share held by a wholly owned Subsidiary of Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall be converted into
that number of Surviving Corporation Shares that bears the same ratio to the
aggregate number of outstanding Surviving Corporation Shares as the number of
Shares held by such Subsidiary bore to the aggregate number of outstanding
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Company, or securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of the capital stock of Company, respectively, shall occur as a result
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, if
necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ ,

vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled 

 



3  to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i)
the total number of Shares subject to such Stock Option, multiplied by (ii)

price per Share subject to such Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of
such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less the amount
of any required withholding Tax. No holder of a Stock Option that has an
exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the per Share Merger

Stock Option before, on, or after the Effective Time.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Share subject to restrictions on transfer
and/or forfeiture granted under a Company Equity Plan or otherwise (the "
_Restricted Stock_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become fully vested and shall be converted automatically into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
less the amount of any required withholding Tax, in accordance with Section
2.1.

(c) At the Effective Time, each stock unit granted under a Company Equity
Plan or otherwise (each, a " _Stock Unit_ "), whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of Stock Units held by such
holder, multiplied by (ii) the per share Merger Consideration, less the amount
of any required withholding Tax. 

(d) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Company shall
take all necessary or appropriate action with respect to the Syniverse
Holdings, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") to
provide that (i) the Exercise Date for the Plan Period (as each such term is
defined in the Company ESPP) that is in effect as of the date of this
Agreement shall occur on or before the last trading day prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) no employee participating in the Company ESPP may increase his or
her payroll deduction thereunder following the date of this
Agreement (including necessary or appropriate actions pursuant to Section 6

Company ESPP and referenced herein as " _ESPP Options_ ") issued and
outstanding under the Company ESPP on such Exercise Date will be
automatically exercised on such Exercise Date, (iv) the Shares issued pursuant
to the exercise of such ESPP Options shall be treated in the manner described
in Section 2.1, (v) no new Plan Period shall commence on or following the
date of this Agreement, and (vi) the Company ESPP shall terminate on the

thereafter to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital stock of
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries pursuant to
the Company ESPP.

(e) Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to ensure that,
as of the Effective Time, (i) the Company Equity Plans shall terminate and
(ii) no holder of Stock Options, Restricted Stock or Stock Units and no
participant in any Company Equity Plan shall have any rights to acquire, or
other rights in respect of, the capital stock of Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, except the rights contemplated by
Sections 2.1 and 2.2(a), (b) and (c).

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee administering the Company Equity Plans or Company ESPP) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to effect the transactions described in clauses (a) through (e) of
this Section.

 



4 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall deliver all necessary or
appropriate notices (which notices shall have been approved by Parent, in its
reasonable discretion) to each holder of Stock Options, Restricted Stock,
Stock Units or any participant in the Company ESPP, setting forth each
holders or participants rights pursuant to the applicable Company Equity
Plan or the Company ESPP, as applicable, and stating that such Stock Options,
Restricted Stock, Stock Unit or any rights pursuant to the Company ESPP, as
applicable, shall be treated in the manner set forth in this Section 2.2.

Section 2.3  _Exchange and Payment for Shares_.

(a) At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to
be deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") cash in an amount
equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration into which Shares have been
converted in accordance with Section 2.1(a). The cash deposited with the
Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall hereinafter be referred to
as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments due pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) or 2.5, except as
provided in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) an outstanding
certificate (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares or (ii) uncertificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which, in each case, were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such Person shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal, and shall contain such other provisions as Parent or the
Paying Agent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Upon
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly pay, the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share (subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), and
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. In the event that the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer, that the signatures on such Certificate or any related
stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such
payment to a Person other than

 



5  the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender or
transfer, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, pursuant
to Section 2.1(a), without any interest thereon.

(c) Parent shall take all actions necessary so that, no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or
cause to be paid to each holder of Stock Options or Stock Units granted under
any Company Equity Plan the amounts to which such holder is entitled as
determined in accordance with Section 2.2(a) and (c) through the Surviving
Corporations or applicable Subsidiarys payroll, unless alternative
arrangements are specified by a holder that is no longer able to receive such
payment through the Surviving Corporations or applicable Subsidiarys payroll
system, to the extent permitted thereby. In the event that the Surviving
Corporation has insufficient cash to make such payment to each holder of Stock
Options or Stock Units, Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the
Surviving Corporation sufficient cash to pay such amounts.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares,
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

(e) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares entitled to receive such consideration, and Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in the amount of any
such losses to the extent necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand.

(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, without interest.

 

(g) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



6 (h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it, the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

(i) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected as described in Section 2.5 shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Shares or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
Any amounts that are so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting
Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to
appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably
lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.1(a). Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands
for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands
and any other instruments received by Company relating to rights to appraisal,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or
offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") (which sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of
which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an

 



7  express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in this
Article III, or to one or more of Companys covenants contained herein,
_provided_ , that disclosure in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall apply only to the indicated Section of this Agreement except to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure is relevant to another Section of this Agreement, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Material Adverse
Effect) or (ii) as disclosed in any Company SEC Document publicly available
prior to the date hereof but excluding the exhibits and schedules thereto,
disclosures in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" sections
thereof or any other disclosure included in such Company SEC Documents that
is cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature (it being understood
and agreed that any disclosure in the Company SEC Documents shall be deemed
disclosed with respect to any Section of this Article III only to the extent
that it is readily apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it is
applicable to such Section), Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

(a) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept)
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except in the case of clauses (ii) (only with respect to
Subsidiaries, other than Syniverse Technologies, Inc.) and (iii), where the
failure to have such power and authority or to be so qualified or licensed or
in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) Company has previously made available to Parent true and complete copies
of Companys certificate of incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ") and
bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") and the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of its Significant
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each
as so made available is in full force and effect. Company is not in violation
of any provision of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws. None of the
Subsidiaries of the Company are in violation of such Subsidiarys certificate
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), except,
in the case of any violation, that individually or in the aggregate would
have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.2 _Capital Stock_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 100,300,000 Shares,
300,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Company
Preferred Stock_ "), and 300,000 shares of Class A Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per

 



8  share (the " _Company Class A Preferred Stock_"). As of the close of
business on October 27, 2010, (i) 70,213,314 Shares (excluding treasury
shares) were issued and outstanding (of which 1,310,884 Shares were shares of
Restricted Stock), (ii) 199,998 Shares were held by Company in its treasury,
(iii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock or Company Class A Preferred Stock
were issued and outstanding and no shares of Company Preferred Stock or
Company Class A Preferred Stock were held by Company in its treasury, and (iv)
7,729,222 Shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to Company Equity Plans
(of which 2,935,252 Shares were subject to outstanding Stock Options, 10,000
Shares were subject to outstanding Stock Units and 928,736 Shares were subject
to outstanding ESPP Options). All the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Company are, and all shares reserved for issuance as noted in clause (iv)
above will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
any preemptive rights or similar antidilution rights. No shares of capital
stock of Company are owned by any Subsidiary of Company. Neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
or exercisable for, securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of Company or such Subsidiary on any matter. As of the date of
this Agreement, except for this Agreement, as set forth above in this Section
3.2(a), the Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Stock Units set forth in
Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the ESPP Options, and the

Subsidiary that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Company, there are no
outstanding (A) shares of capital stock or other voting securities or equity
interests of Company, (B) securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock
or other voting securities or equity interests of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (C) stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights,
performance units, interests in or rights to the ownership or earnings of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other equity equivalent or equity-based
award or right, (D) subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments,

any of its Subsidiaries or rights or interests described in clause (C), or (E)
obligations of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise, to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue,
grant, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, granted, delivered or sold, any
such securities. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor to the
knowledge of Company is any other Person, a party to or bound by any
contracts or understandings with respect to the voting (including voting
trusts and proxies) or, other than under Company Equity Plans (or grants
thereunder) or the Company Credit Agreement, the sale or transfer
(including agreements imposing transfer restrictions) of any shares of its
capital stock or other equity interests.

(b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders, as of October 27, 2010, of (i) outstanding Stock
Options, other than the ESPP Options, indicating, with respect to each Stock
Option then outstanding, the type of award granted, the number of Shares
subject to such Stock Option, the name of the plan under which such Stock

Each Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, and, other than the ESPP Options, the
exercise price of each other Stock Option is no less than the fair market
value of a Share as determined on the date of grant of such Stock Option.
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all Company
Equity Plans and the forms of all award agreements evidencing outstanding
Stock Options, Restricted Stock or Stock Unit grants.

Section 3.3 _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of (a) each
Subsidiary of Company, including its jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation, and (b) each other corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other entity that is not a Subsidiary but in which Company holds,
directly or indirectly, an equity interest (each, an " _Company Minority
Interest Business_ "), and the percentage of Companys equity interest in
such Company Minority Interest Business relative to all outstanding equity
interests (on a fully diluted basis). All of the shares of capital stock or
other equity or voting interests of each such Company Minority Interest
Business that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Company or a Subsidiary
thereof are owned free and clear of all Liens other than restrictions on
transfer under applicable securities Laws and Liens created pursuant to the
Company Credit Agreement. Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, its Subsidiaries and its interests in the Company
Minority Interest Businesses, Company does not own, directly or indirectly,

outstanding shares of capital stock or other voting securities or equity
interests of each Subsidiary of Company have been duly authorized and validly
issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to any preemptive
rights or similar antidilution rights. All of the shares of capital stock or
other voting securities or equity interests of each such Subsidiary are
owned, directly or indirectly, by Company, free and clear of all pledges,
claims, liens, charges, call rights, options, rights of first refusal,
encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including any limitation on voting, sale, transfer or other disposition or
exercise of any other attribute of ownership) (collectively, " _Liens_ ")
other than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities Laws
and Liens created pursuant to the Company Credit Agreement.

Section 3.4 _Authority_.

does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance by Company with the provisions hereof will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with

with the SEC, all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by them with the SEC since January 1, 2009

have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend
the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including funding of the Payment Fund) and

to satisfy all of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement, including (i) the payment of any amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Article II, (ii) the payment of any Indebtedness of Company and
any of its Subsidiaries required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled,

the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and each constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. Except for a fee letter
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing and an engagement letter

Sub, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments. Subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, as of

to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be
satisfied or that the Financing or any other funds necessary for the
satisfaction of all of Funding Obligations will not be available to Parent on
the Closing Date. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Article III and compliance by Company of its covenants and
agreements hereunder and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions of the
Financing, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing, together with the cash
and cash equivalents available to Company, are sufficient to satisfy the

required to be paid prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Debt
Financing Commitments.

(l) settle or compromise any litigation, audit, claim or action against
Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than settlements or compromises of
litigations, audits, claims or actions where the amounts paid in settlement or
compromise do not exceed $1,000,000 individually or $5,000,000 in the
aggregate;

 

(m) forgive any loans to employees, officers, directors or any of their
Affiliates;

 

(n) other than as set forth in the capital budgets set forth in Section 5.1 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, make or authorize any capital expenditures in
excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate; or

(o) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of, the foregoing
actions.

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, endorse, cooperate with or
knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public
information or data) any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or the
making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person other than Parent, Merger
Sub or any Representatives of the foregoing Persons any non-public information
or data with respect to or for the purpose of facilitating, any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, that Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective Representatives may, in response to an inquiry not made pursuant to
an action prohibited by this Section 5.2, inform the Person making such
inquiry that Company and its Subsidiaries are bound by an agreement

 



32  including a non solicitation provision that prohibits discussions or
negotiations, subject to limited exceptions, or (iii) enter into any letter of
intent, definitive acquisition agreement, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement or partnership agreement
requiring Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations hereunder or
fail to consummate the Merger. Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all activities, solicitations, encouragement, discussions
or negotiations with any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub or any
Representatives of the foregoing Persons conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, (B) request the prompt return or destruction, to the
extent permitted by any confidentiality agreement, of all confidential
information previously furnished, and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release
or modify any provision of any standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives is a party, and shall enforce the provisions of
any such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time following
the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval,
(1) Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, (2) such
Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a material violation of this
Section 5.2(a), (3) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, and (4) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take the actions
referred to in clause (x) or (y) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then Company may (and may authorize its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to) (x) furnish non-public
information with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that any non-public information
provided to any Person given such access shall have previously been provided
to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the
time it is provided to such Person (and in any event within 24 hours) and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives) regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that Company shall promptly
provide to Parent (and in any event within 48 hours) (i) an unredacted copy
of any Acquisition Proposal made in writing provided to Company, and the
identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and (ii) a written
summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal
not made in writing.

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify) in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, or (B) adopt, approve or publicly recommend, endorse or
otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal (each
such action set forth in this Section 5.2(b)(i) being referred to herein as an
" _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) cause or permit Company to enter
into any letter of intent, definitive acquisition agreement, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement or
partnership agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")
constituting any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement referred to in Section 5.2(a)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, if an
Intervening Event occurs or if Company is in receipt of a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with independent financial advisors and

 



33  outside counsel, is a Superior Proposal, after (in each case) giving effect
to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which are offered by
Parent (including pursuant to clause (iii) below) and after consultation with
its outside counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith, that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Company Board may, (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) solely with respect to a Superior Proposal,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii) and enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination Company pays the
Termination Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of Section
7.1(d)(iii) and Section 7.3; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board
may not effect an Adverse Change Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing
clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)
unless (A) Company shall not have breached this Section 5.2 in any material
respect and (B) 

(i) such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Proposal; 

(ii) Company has given Parent at least seventy-two (72) hours prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously
provided an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements
with the party making such Superior Proposal); and

(iii) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement, and/or the Financing Commitments such that it
would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal.

In the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior Proposal,
Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Parent a new written
notice, the notice period shall have recommenced and Company shall be required
to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.2 with respect to such new
written notice, except that the deadline for such new written notice shall be
reduced to forty-eight (48) hours (rather than seventy-two (72) hours
referenced in clause (ii) above).

(c) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in Sections 5.2(a) and
(b), Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise Parent
in writing in the event Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives
receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for non-public
information (other than requests for information in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and unrelated to an Acquisition
Proposal) or any request to engage in negotiation that is reasonably likely to
lead to or that

 



34  contemplates or relates to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together
with the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request
and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or
request. Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing)
in all material respects on a timely basis of the status (including after the
occurrence of any material amendment or modification) of any such Acquisition
Proposal or request. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing if it determines to begin providing non-public information or to
engage in negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Sections 5.2(a) or (b) and shall in no event begin providing such information
or engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such
notice.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit Company from (i)
issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) and 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, in each case after the
commencement of a tender offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act), or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of Company
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with
outside counsel), failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that in no event
shall this Section 5.2(d) affect the obligations of Company specified in
Sections 5.2(b) and (c) (and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 5.2(d) shall effect a determination that an Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred pursuant to Section 5.2(b)); and _provided_
_further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and
listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(ii)) unless
the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation within the
period that is no later than the earlier of (x) 10 Business Days after such
disclosure or (y) 2 Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person or
group of Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to any direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, including any merger, reorganization, consolidation, tender
offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture or similar transaction, (A) of assets or businesses of Company and its
Subsidiaries that generate more than 20% of the net revenues or net income or
that represent more 20% of the total assets (based on fair market value), of
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
transaction, (B) more than 20% of any class of capital stock, other equity
security or voting power of Company or any resulting parent company of Company
or (C) involving businesses of Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
individually or taken together, which businesses constitute more than 20% of
the net revenues, net income or total assets (based on fair market value) of
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
transaction, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such
term changed from 

 



35  20% to 50%) that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal
(including financing, timing, stockholder litigation and breakup fee and
expense reimbursement provisions) and the Person making the proposal, (A) if
consummated would be more favorable to the stockholders of Company from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (B) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed on a timely basis.

 

Section 5.3 _Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following
clearance by the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Company will advise
Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC
to amend the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information and Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of Parent) as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. If
prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to Company or any
Subsidiary of Company, or any change occurs with respect to information
supplied by or on behalf of Company or Parent, respectively, for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement that, in each case, is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall promptly notify the other of such event, and Company and
Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
Companys stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or, in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, Company shall provide Parent an opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response and shall consider in good faith any
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

 

(b) Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, take all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and the
Company Charter and the Company Bylaws to (i) duly call, give notice of,
convene and (ii) hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable following clearance by the
SEC of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder
Approval. Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically
permitted by Section 5.2(b), Company, through the Company Board, shall (x)
recommend to Companys stockholders that they adopt this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "), (y) include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and (z) solicit Stockholder Approval. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 5.3(b) shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Company
or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not
prohibit accurate disclosure in the Proxy Statement or otherwise (and such
disclosure shall not be deemed

 



36  to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) of factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of Company or the fact
that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the Person making
such proposal or the material terms of such proposal, to the extent the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that such information, facts, identity or terms are required to be
disclosed under applicable Law.

Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, during the
period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, to all their respective properties, assets,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period,
Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent:
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed, furnished or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws and which is not generally
available on the EDGAR internet database and (ii) all other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request (including all work papers of its auditors and
all Tax Returns filed and those in preparation); _provided_ , that neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of such party, (A) breach any agreement with any third
party, (B) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held
by such party or (C) otherwise violate any applicable Law. In the event any of
the restrictions in clauses (A) through (C) of the foregoing sentence shall
apply, the parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements,
including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable
Laws, including Antitrust Laws.

 

(b) All such information shall be held confidential in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and Company, dated as
of September 1, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or information provided,
made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement (other than
the Company Disclosure Letter) shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereunder.

Section 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from, or
participation in other discussions or negotiations with, third parties,
including under any Material Contract, (ii) obtain

 



37  all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders
and authorizations from Governmental Entities, make all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings and take all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Action by, any
Governmental Entity, including filings under the HSR Act with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice and all other filings, registrations and notices
under Foreign Antitrust Laws and that the parties otherwise mutually
reasonably agree are appropriate and necessary with the applicable
Governmental Entities under any other applicable Antitrust Laws within the
time periods specified thereunder (or, if such time period is not specified,
within a reasonable time), (iii) vigorously resist, contest or defend any
Action (including administrative or judicial Actions) challenging the Merger
or the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
is in effect and that could restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, by vigorously
pursuing all avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, and (iv) execute
and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and fully to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Each of the
parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating to the
exchange of information, Parent and Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other in
connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or Company, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of Parent and Company shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other written communications received by Company or
Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any
Governmental Entity and/or third party with respect to such transactions,
and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, shall provide the
other party and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall and, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, propose, negotiate, offer
to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
or effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any
action (including any action that limits its freedom of action, ownership or
control with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, any of the
businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries) which it is
lawfully capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to
take such action, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the
commencement of any Action to prohibit the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated

 



38  by this Agreement, or if already commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any Action so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the Outside Date).
Company shall not, without the written consent of Parent, publicly or before
any Governmental Entity or other third party, offer, suggest, propose or
negotiate, and shall not commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, any sale, divestiture, disposition, prohibition or
limitation or other action of a type described in this Section 5.5(b).

 

Section 5.6 _Takeover Laws_. Each of Company and Parent and their respective
Boards of Directors shall (a) take no action to cause any Takeover Law to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication could be material to Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or (c) any change, condition or event (i)
that renders or would reasonably be expected to render any representation or
warranty of such party set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
to an extent such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.3(a), as
applicable, would not be satisfied if the Closing were to then occur or (ii)
that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement (including any condition set forth in Article VI) to
be complied with or satisfied by such party hereunder; _provided_ , that no
such notification, nor any failure to make such notification, shall affect any
of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

Section 5.8 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume and perform all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all rights to advancement of expenses to, the
current or former directors and officers of Company as provided in the Company
Charter or the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby), and such rights shall continue in full
force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of
such acts or omissions, except as otherwise required by 

 



39  applicable Law, and to include and cause to be maintained in effect in the
Surviving Corporations (or any successors) certificate of incorporation, for
a period of six years after the Effective Time, the current provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering each Person currently
covered by Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a
correct and complete copy of which has been heretofore made available to
Parent) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor "tail" policies of an insurance company with the same or better
rating as Companys current insurance carrier the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to such directors and officers than Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof or (ii) Parent may request that Company obtain such extended reporting
period coverage under Companys existing insurance programs (to be effective
as of the Effective Time); and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate premiums for
insurance under this Section 5.8(b) in excess of 300% of the amount of the
aggregate premiums paid by Company for fiscal year 2010 for such purpose
(which fiscal year 2010 premiums are hereby represented and warranted by
Company to be as set forth in Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.

 

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper
provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

Section 5.9  _Employees_.

(a) After the Effective Time and through December 31, 2011, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall cause each individual employed by Company as of the Closing
Date to receive a base salary, annual bonus opportunity (but not equity or
equity-based compensation awards), 401(k) and health and welfare benefits
substantially comparable in the aggregate to that in effect immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) the severance plans and policies set forth in
the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to Section 5.9(a) covering
employees of Company and its Subsidiaries shall remain in effect. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.9 or any other provision of this Agreement,
whether express or implied, (A) shall be construed to create (x) any third-
party beneficiary or other rights in any current or former employee,
director, consultant or independent contractor of Company or its Subsidiaries
or any other individual associated therewith (including any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) or any other Person other 

 



40  than the parties to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
union, works council or collective bargaining representative or any
participant in any Company Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or
arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)) or (y) any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period or to a particular
term or condition of employment with the Surviving Corporation or
its Affiliates or (B) subject to compliance with the first sentence of this
Section 5.9(a), shall limit the right of Parent, Company, Surviving
Corporation and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Company Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or other
arrangement.

(b) For all purposes (including but not limited to purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit
plans of Parent (such employee benefit plans of Parent shall be referred to
hereinafter as the " _New Plans_ ") providing benefits to (i) any employee of
Company or its Affiliates on or after the Effective Time (such employees shall
be referred to hereinafter as the " _Company Employees_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Company and
its Affiliates and their respective predecessors to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any applicable
similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Transition Date, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, for the purposes of
equity or equity-based plans, or to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. " _Transition Date_ " means, with respect to any Company Employee,
the date Parent or the Surviving Corporation commences providing benefits to
such employee with respect to each New Plan.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Transition Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (A) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans of Parent to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company employee benefit plan in
which such Company Employee was participating immediately prior to the
Transition Date (such plans of Company prior to the Transition Date
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); (B) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to
any Company Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee, and
his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the similar plans of Company or its Affiliates, in which such
Company Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (C) any eligible expenses
incurred by such Company Employee, and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date to
be taken into account under such New Plan, to the extent taken into account
under such Old Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section shall require Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to provide benefits to any Company Employee
under any New Plans, if any, prior to January 1, 2012.

 



41 Section 5.10  _Public Announcements_. Parent and Company shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with one another before issuing, and give each
other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release
or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not, without the prior
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
issue any such press release or make any public announcement, except as may
be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange, or in connection with
any press release or public announcements with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 5.2.

Section 5.11  _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

Section 5.12 _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments and shall not permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under the Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification or
waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (v) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing, (w) impose new or additional conditions, or
otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt
Financing, (x) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (y) make the funding of the
Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur or (z) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto,
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section,
Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitments to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date
hereof, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the
aggregate, would not prevent, delay or impair the availability of the
financing under the Debt Financing Commitments or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall deliver to Company a
copy of any proposed amendment, replacement, supplement, waiver or
modification to the Financing Commitments or any of the definitive agreements
with respect thereto to Company at least 1 Business Day prior to the proposed
execution of the same. For purposes of this Section 5.12, references to
"Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments as permitted to be amended or modified by this Section 5.12(a) and
references to "Financing Commitments" or "Debt Financing Commitments" shall
include such documents as permitted to be amended or modified

 



42  by this Section 5.12(a). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt
Financing Commitments until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, (ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Commitments (including by
consummating the financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing
Commitments) at or prior to Closing and otherwise comply with their respective
obligations thereunder, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, (iv) consummate
the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (v) enforce their respective rights
under the Debt Financing Commitments, including to the extent required by
Section 8.10, and (vi) cause the lenders and other Persons providing
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing contemplated to be funded
on the Closing Date by the Debt Financing Commitments (or such lesser amount
as may be required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby) (including by taking enforcement action to cause such
lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund such Financing
to the extent required by Section 8.10). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give Company prompt notice if
Parent obtains actual knowledge: (A) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any
party to any Financing Commitment or definitive document related to the
Financing of which Parent or its Affiliates becomes aware; (B) of the receipt
of any written notice or other written communication from any Person with
respect to any: (x) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive
document related to the Financing or any provisions of the Financing
Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or (y) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing
Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing or any definitive agreement with respect
thereto); and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitment or the definitive documents related to the Financing; provided,
that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any obligation to
disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege if Parent and Merger Sub shall have used their reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive
such privilege. Not in limitation of their obligations to provide such
information without request as provided in the preceding sentence, as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within five (5) Business Days after
the date Company delivers Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by Company
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the
immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent than those set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment, in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
earlier of the last business day of the Marketing Period.

 



43 (b) Prior to the Closing, Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents sole expense, all reasonable
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary in connection
with the Financing, including (i) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their
Financing Sources the Essential Marketing Information, (ii) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with
the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders
and purchasers of, the Financing and the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer and General Counsel of Company and other members of senior
management and Representatives of Company), presentations, customary high
yield road shows during the Marketing Period, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing
(iii) assisting Parent and its Financing Sources in the preparation
of customary offering memoranda suitable for use in a "high yield road show"
relating to offering of the Senior Notes (as defined below) in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and its Financing Sources relating to the
placing or selling or obtaining commitments for the purchase or acquisition
of the Senior Notes, including discussion of Company, financial statements,
pro forma financials statements and other financial data of the type and form
customarily included in offering memoranda, private placements memoranda and
similar documents customarily used in Rule 144A offerings, to consummate an
offering of the Senior Notes (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include financial statements or information required by Rules 3-09, 3-10 or
3-16 of Regulation S-X, Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by
Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or other information customarily excluded from a
Rule 144A offering memorandum), and supplements and final versions of such
offering document; (iv) assisting Parent and its Financing Sources in the
preparation of customary bank information memoranda, rating agency
presentations and lender presentations relating to the Debt Financing, (v)
cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its Financing Sources
for all or any portion of the Debt Financing, (vi) providing and executing
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including a certificate of
the Chief Financial Officer of Company with respect to solvency matters
substantially in the form attached to the Debt Financing Commitment, (vii)
executing and delivering any pledge and security documents and otherwise
facilitating the pledging of collateral, and (viii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain customary comfort letters by auditors of Company
(including customary "negative assurances") with respect to information in the
offering document, which such auditors are prepared to issue upon completion
of customary procedures, each in form and substance customary for high yield
debt securities offerings by affiliates of the Sponsor, and legal opinions
reasonably requested by Parent and customary for financings similar to the
Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (a) irrespective of the above, no
obligation of Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate,
document or instrument (other than the authorization letters referred to
above) shall be effective until the Effective Time and none of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any
certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing
(including the entry into any agreement that is effective before the
Effective Time) or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time, (b)
nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of Company or its Subsidiaries
and (c) none of Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to issue
any offering or information document. None of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than
reasonable out-of-pocket costs for which Parent is require to reimburse
Company as provided

 



44  below) in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with
this Section 5.12(b)) and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to Company or its Subsidiaries
provided by Company in writing specifically for use in the Financing offering
documents). Parent shall, promptly upon request by Company, reimburse Company
for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 5.12(b). Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos shall be used solely in a manner
that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise
adversely affect Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing
or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI. In addition, the completion of the
issuance of senior notes (the " _Senior Notes_ ") contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments is not a condition to Closing. In the event that all or
any portion of the Debt Financing to be obtained through the issuance of the
Senior Notes as contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments has not been
obtained on or prior to the Closing, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause, no later than the Closing, the senior unsecured credit
facility to be drawn and the proceeds of the senior unsecured credit facility
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments to be used to replace such
portion of the Senior Notes not issued at Closing.

Section 5.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened in writing, against Company and/or the members of the Company Board
prior to the Effective Time, Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
stockholder litigation brought, or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened in
writing against Company and/or members of the Company Board and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Company shall
reasonably consult with Parent with respect to the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 5.14 _Discontinuance of Regulated Intrastate Telecommunications
Services_. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, prior to the
Closing, complete the process of discontinuing its provision of regulated
intrastate telecommunications service in each of the states in which it
operates and shall keep Parent reasonably informed about the status of such
efforts and shall provide Parent with copies of all the documents
related thereto, if any.

shall Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Payment of the Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (1) Parent or Company
pursuant to (i) Section 7.1(b)(i) and all of the conditions to Closing set
forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than (x) the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1(b) (solely insofar as it relates to Foreign Antitrust Laws),
Section 6.1(c) (solely insofar as the matters set forth therein arise from
Foreign Antitrust Laws or actions taken by the Federal Communications
Commission) and Section 6.2(f) and (y) those other conditions that, by their

satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination) have been
satisfied or (ii) Section 7.1(b)(ii) (solely insofar as the matters set forth
therein arise from Foreign Antitrust Laws or actions taken by the Federal
Communications Commission), then Parent shall pay to Company as liquidated
damages an amount equal to $60,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds, at
the time of termination in the case of a termination by Parent or within two
Business Days after such termination in the case of a termination by Company.

 



50 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(i) or Section 7.1(d)(ii), then Parent shall pay to Company as
liquidated damages an amount equal to $120,000,000, minus any reimbursement
and indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 5.12(b), by
wire transfer of same day funds, within two Business Days after such
termination. Any fee payable or paid by Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(c) or
7.3(d) shall be referred to herein as a " _Parent Termination Fee_ ".

(e) Each of Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. If Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to Section 7.3(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Company for the amounts
set forth in Section 7.3(b), Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section
7.3(b) from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum
equal to the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made (the " _Prime Rate_ "). If Parent fails promptly to
pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 7.3(c) or 7.3(d), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Company commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Parent for the amounts set forth in Section 7.3(c) or 7.3(d), Parent
shall pay to Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amounts set forth in Section 7.3(c) or 7.3(d) from the date of termination
of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Parent and Merger Sub
fail to effect the Closing for any or no reason or otherwise breach this
Agreement or fail to perform hereunder (in any case, whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then, except for an order of
specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by Section
8.10, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages
with respect to the foregoing, Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Parent and Merger
Sub for any breach, loss or damage shall be to terminate this Agreement
as provided, and only to the extent provided in Section 7.1(d), and receive
payment of the Parent Termination Fee under and only to the extent provided in
