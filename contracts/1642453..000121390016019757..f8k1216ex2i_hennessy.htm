WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the issued

subject to the conditions set forth herein;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company may determine prior to Closing and in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement that, immediately after the effectiveness of the
Merger, the Surviving Company shall be merged with and into a wholly owned
limited liability company subsidiary of Parent organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware (" _LLC Sub_ "), with LLC Sub continuing as the
surviving entity in the LLC Sub Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent;

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company by Parent and in accordance with the
terms hereof, Parent shall provide an opportunity to its stockholders to have
their Offering Shares redeemed for the consideration, and on the terms and
subject to the conditions and limitations, set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable Parent Governing Documents in conjunction with, _inter alia_,
obtaining approval from the stockholders of Parent for the Merger
(collectively with the other transactions, authorization and approvals set
forth in the Proxy Statement, the " _Offer_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, Hennessy Capital Partners II LLC (the " _Sponsor_ ") has delivered
to the Company a Voting and Support Agreement, dated as of the date hereof
(the " _Founder Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things,
the Persons indicated on the signature pages thereof have agreed to vote
their Parent Common Stock in favor of certain matters (including the Merger
and certain other proposals of the Parent set forth in its Proxy Statement),
all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Sponsor has also delivered to the Company a Sponsor Share
Forfeiture Agreement whereby Sponsor has agreed that prior to the Closing,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Sponsor shall
transfer to Parent for forfeiture the Sponsor Forfeited Shares, and at
Closing, Parent shall issue an equivalent number of new shares of Parent
Common Stock as part of the Closing Parent Stock Consideration on the terms

WHEREAS, each of the boards of directors of the Company, Parent and the
Merger Sub has (a) determined that the Merger is fair, advisable and in the
best interests of its respective companies and stockholders and (b) by either
unanimous written consent in lieu of meeting or unanimous vote of all the
directors attending at a meeting in which a quorum is in attendance, approved

herein;

  



  

WHEREAS, each of the boards of directors of the Company, Parent and the
Merger Sub has determined to recommend to its respective stockholders the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Parties desire for U.S. federal income Tax purposes that (a) to
the extent that clause (b) of this recital is inapplicable, the Merger
qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, and that this Agreement constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and
(b) if the Company elects to consummate the LLC Sub Merger, the Merger and the
LLC Sub Merger (together, the " _Integrated Mergers_ ") constitute an
integrated plan described in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321 and that this
Agreement and the LLC Sub Merger Agreement constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

Article I. 
  
 THE MERGER

  



  

1.01. _The Merger._

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, the
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of the Merger Sub will cease, and
the Company will be the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

  



  

(b) At the Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub will cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A _attached hereto (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and will make all other filings
or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
will become effective at such time on the Closing Date as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such other time as specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  



  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will succeed to
all the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be
subject to all of the Liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

  



  

1.02. _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger:

  



  

(a) The share transfer books of the Company will be closed, and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Company Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.

  



  

(b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (which excludes, in each case, Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares, if any, and which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes all shares of
Common Stock issued upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock in
accordance with _Section 8.01(f)_ ) will be automatically converted into
the right to receive (i) the Per Common Share Closing Merger Consideration
and (ii) the Per Common Share Earnout Merger Consideration (the aggregate
consideration to which holders of Common Stock become entitled pursuant to
this _Section 1.02(b)_ is referred to herein as the " _Common Stock Merger
Consideration_ "). The Common Stock Merger Consideration will be paid in the
manner provided in _Section 1.08_.

  



  

(c)  Each share of Common Stock, if any, held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Company or Parent (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") will be automatically canceled and no payment will be
made with respect thereto.

  



  

(d)  Each share of common stock of the Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
automatically converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

  



  

1.03. _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, the Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the
foregoing, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company will be
amended and restated in its entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
D _until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 9.01_, in accordance with
the provisions thereof and the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the
Surviving Company will be amended and restated to be in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_ until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 9.01_,
in accordance with the provisions thereof, the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Company and the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
amendment to the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Surviving
Company will diminish the exculpation, indemnification or expense advancement
or reimbursement provisions in respect of directors or officers of the
Company or any other Group Company that held office as of the date hereof in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.04.   _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in accordance
with applicable Law, the directors of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time
will be the directors of the Surviving Company (and any other directors of
the Company will be deemed to have been removed as of the Effective Time), and
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time will be the officers of the
Surviving Company, each such initial director and initial officer of the
Surviving Company to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company as in effect from and after
the Effective Time.

  



  

1.05. _Closing Calculations_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Parent a
certificate signed by the Company CFO, solely in such capacity and not in his
personal capacity (the " _Closing Certificate_ "), setting forth (a) a
preliminary consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies as of the
Reference Time, (b) (i) (A) the Company's good faith estimate of Cash as of
the Reference Time after the paydown of Company Transaction Expenses prior to
the Closing plus (B) 50% of the Equity Backstop Commitment Fee paid by the
Company prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Closing Cash_ "), (ii) the
Company's good faith estimate of Indebtedness as of the Reference Time,
including the Payoff Amount (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "), and (iii) the
Company's good faith estimate of Company Transaction Expenses that will be
unpaid as of the Closing (the " _Closing Company Transaction Expenses_
"). The Closing Certificate so delivered by the Company CFO will confirm in
writing that it has been prepared in good faith using the latest available
financial information and will include materials showing in reasonable detail
the Company's support and computations for the amounts included in the
Closing Certificate and will also include, consistent with the foregoing
calculations, the Company's determination of (1) the Closing Aggregate Merger
Consideration and (2) the Per Common Share Closing Merger Consideration.
Parent shall be entitled to review and make reasonable comments on the matters
and amounts set forth in the Closing Certificate so delivered by the Company
CFO pursuant to this _Section 1.05_. The Company will cooperate with Parent
in the review of the Closing Certificate, including providing Parent and its
Representatives with reasonable access to the relevant books, records and
finance employees of the Company. The Company will cooperate reasonably with
Parent to revise the Closing Certificate if necessary to reflect Parent's
reasonable comments. If the Closing Certificate is so revised, such revised
Closing Certificate, or if Parent had no such comments, then the initial
Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be the final "Closing Statement," in
each case as approved in writing by Parent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

1.06. _Dissenting Shares_. If applicable, and to the extent available under
Section 262 of the DGCL, any share of capital stock of the Company that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is
held by a Stockholder who did not consent to or vote (by a valid and
enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the approval of this Agreement,
which Stockholder complies with all of the provisions of the DGCL relevant to
the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights (such share being a "
_Dissenting Share_ ," and such Stockholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_
"), will not be converted into the right to receive the consideration to
which the Dissenting Stockholder would be entitled pursuant to _Section
1.02_, but rather will be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder fails
to perfect such Stockholder's dissenters' rights under the DGCL or
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon automatically be
converted into the right to receive the consideration referred to in _Section
1.02_, subject to the payment procedures set forth in _Section 1.07_  and
_Section 1.08_ and will no longer be Dissenting Shares for purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of a
Stockholder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease. The Company will
not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal
with respect to any Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent may or may not be given in the sole and absolute
discretion of Parent).

1.07. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of Tax Law. If Parent so withholds amounts, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
such Person in respect of such deduction and withholding. At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent will (a) notify the Stockholder
Representative and the Stockholders of any anticipated withholding, (b)
consult with the Stockholder Representative in good faith to determine whether
such deduction and withholding is required under applicable Tax Law and (c)
cooperate with the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders to
minimize the amount of any applicable withholding.

  



  

1.08. _Payment Methodology_.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will enter into an exchange agent
agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B _attached hereto (the "
_Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), and at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Parent Stock Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Common Stock.

  



  

(b)  After the Closing, promptly following delivery to the Exchange Agent of
a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal and certificates
representing shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, along
with a properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or if
applicable, the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Form W-8), substantially
in the form of  _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "),
the Exchange Agent will (and Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to)
promptly issue to each Common Stockholder (other than any Person who was a
record holder of Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time) that delivers a duly executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Per
Common Share Closing Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares
of Common Stock held of record by such Common Stockholder immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Any portion of the Closing Aggregate Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by the Stockholders three (3) years after the Closing Date
(or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) will
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(c)  With respect to the Earnout Merger Consideration, promptly following the
determination of the number of 2017 Earnout Shares, 2018 Earnout Shares or
2019 Earnout Shares, as applicable, payable (if any) pursuant to _Annex I_
hereto, the Exchange Agent will also (and Parent will direct the Exchange
Agent to also) issue to each Common Stockholder (other than any Person who was
a record holder of Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time) that has delivered a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Per
Common Share Earnout Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares
of Common Stock held of record by such Common Stockholder immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Any portion of the Earnout Merger Consideration (to the
extent payable pursuant to this Agreement and _Annex I_ hereto) remaining
unclaimed by the Common Stockholders three (3) years after the date after the
applicable shares of Parent Common Stock is required to be issued pursuant to
_Annex I_ hereto (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when
the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity) will become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property
of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(d)  Any Parent Stock Consideration that is to be issued to a Stockholder
under this Agreement will be issued directly to such Stockholder of record in
accordance with the instructions specified by such holder in its Letter of
Transmittal. In no event shall any fractional shares of Parent Stock
Consideration be issued under this Agreement (with any fractional share that
would otherwise be issued rounded to the nearest whole share; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event such rounding to the nearest whole share would
result in the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock being issued
to the Stockholders under this Agreement being greater or less than the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Parent Stock
Consideration, then one or more fractional shares that may otherwise be
issued to one or more Stockholders may be rounded as necessary using such
alternative rounding methodology as mutually agreed upon between the
Stockholder Representative and Parent to result in the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock being issued to the Stockholders under this
Agreement being equal to the Parent Stock Consideration).

  



  

(e)  None of Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company nor their
Affiliates will be liable to any Stockholder for any Parent Stock
Consideration paid to any public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

1.09.   _Accredited or Sophisticated Investors_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be obligated to issue shares
of Parent Common Stock to any Stockholder that is not a Confirmed Accredited
Investor or a Confirmed Sophisticated Investor.

  



  

1.10.   _Post-Closing Merger_. The Company shall have the right to elect (the
" _Forward Merger Election_ "), at its sole discretion, no later than thirty
(30) days after the date hereof, by delivery of written notice to Parent, to
cause the Surviving Company to merge (the " _LLC Sub Merger_ "), immediately
following the Effective Time, with and into LLC Sub, with LLC Sub continuing
as the surviving entity in such merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, substantially in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement
attached hereto as _Exhibit L_ (the " _LLC Sub Merger Agreement_ "). If the
Company makes a valid Forward Merger Election in accordance with this _Section
1.10_ , there shall be no condition to the completion of the LLC Sub Merger
other than the completion of the Merger. From and after the LLC Sub Merger,
LLC Sub shall be the Surviving Company for purposes of this Agreement. When
the LLC Sub Merger occurs, Parent shall own all of the membership interests
and other equity in LLC Sub, and LLC Sub shall be disregarded for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes.

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to any Parent SEC Report (the "
_Parent Certifications_ "). Each of the Parent Certifications is true and
correct. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information concerning
Parent is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h)  Parent maintains and will continue to maintain a standard system of
accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP. Parent has
designed and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Parent maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for

received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that Parent has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices. No attorney representing Parent, whether or not employed
by Parent, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Parent Board (or any
committee thereof) or to any director or officer of Parent. Since Parent's
inception, there have been no internal investigations regarding accounting or
revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction
of the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, the
Parent Board or any committee thereof.

  



  

(k)  To Parent's Knowledge, no employee of Parent has provided or is
providing information to any law enforcement agency regarding the commission
or possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of
any applicable Law. Neither Parent nor any officer, employee, contractor,
subcontractor or agent of Parent has discharged, demoted, suspended,
threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against an employee
of Parent in the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of
such employee described in 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a).

  



  

(l)  All accounts payable of Parent on the Parent Subject Balance Sheet or
arising thereafter are the result of bona fide transactions in the Ordinary
Course of Business. Since the date of the Parent Subject Balance Sheet, Parent
has not altered in any material respects its practices for the payment of its
accounts payable, including the timing of such payment.

States Government securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, and held in trust by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company
pursuant to the Parent Trust Agreement. The Parent Trust Agreement is valid
and in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms and
has not been amended or modified. There are no separate agreements, side
letters or other agreements or understandings (whether written or
unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the description of the Parent
Trust Agreement in the Parent SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material
respect and/or that would entitle any Person (other than the underwriters of
Parent's initial public offering for deferred underwriting commissions as
described in the Parent SEC Reports and stockholders of Parent holding shares
of Parent Common Stock sold in Parent's initial public offering who shall
have elected to redeem their shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Parent's certificate of incorporation, as amended) to any portion of the
proceeds in the Parent Trust. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in
the Parent Trust may be released except (x) to pay income and franchise taxes
or for working capital purposes from any interest income earned in the Parent
Trust or (y) to redeem shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Parent's certificate of incorporation, as amended, as described
in the Parent SEC Reports (the " _Permitted Releases_ ").

  



  

4.08.   _Broker_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.08_, there are no
claims for brokerage commissions, finders' fees or similar compensation in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on any
agreement made by or on behalf of Parent or the Merger Sub.

  



  

4.09.   _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete
copy of the commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, by and among
Merger Sub, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman
Islands Branch and the other parties thereto (the " _Debt Financing
Commitment_ "), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide or cause to
be provided the debt amounts set forth therein for the purpose, among others,
of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees
and expenses to be incurred by Parent and the Merger Sub in connection
therewith and for the other purposes set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_
"). As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment has not been amended
or modified, no such amendment or modification is pending or contemplated
(except for amendments to add additional financing sources thereto and as
expressly contemplated in the "market flex" provisions related thereto) and
the Debt Financing Commitment has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded
in any respect. Parent has fully paid or caused to be fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid in connection with the Debt
Financing Commitment that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. The Debt
Financing Commitment is in full force and effect as of the date hereof. The
Debt Financing Commitment, in the form so delivered, is a valid, legal,
binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to Parent's
Knowledge, the other parties thereto, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Legal
Requirements relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by
equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought at law or in
equity). Assuming the accuracy of the Company's representations and
warranties hereunder, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent or the Merger Sub or to Parent's Knowledge, any
other parties thereto, under the Debt Financing Commitment, or a failure of
any condition to the Debt Financing or otherwise result in any portion of the
Debt Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. Assuming the accuracy of
the Company's representations and warranties hereunder and performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will fail to timely
be satisfied or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will be
unavailable on the Closing Date. The Debt Financing Commitment is not subject
to any conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to
make the full amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent and the
Merger Sub at the Closing other than as set forth therein (including the
payment of customary fees). Except for the "Fee Letter" referred to in the
Debt Financing Commitment, there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements to which Parent or the Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates is a party which are related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each party hereto agrees that a breach of this
representation and warranty will not result in the failure of a condition
precedent hereunder, if (notwithstanding such breach) Parent (i) is willing
and able to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing
Date and (ii) has funds sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby at the Closing.

or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any of
its equity securities pursuant to the Investor Agreements or Section 7.05 or

Parent SEC Reports, mailings to Parent's shareholders with respect to the
Offer and/or the Merger, any supplements thereto and/or in any other document
filed with any Governmental Entity in connection herewith (including the
Offer Documents), will, at the date of filing and/or mailing, as the case may
be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (subject to the
qualifications and limitations set forth in the materials provided by Parent
or that is included in the applicable filings). No representation or warranty

the Proxy Statement.

  



  

4.16.   _Tax-Free Reorganization_. As of the date hereof, Parent knows of no

qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment.

  



  

4.17.   _Investor Agreements_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and
complete copy of the executed Investor Agreements, which have not been
amended or modified in any manner as of the date hereof. No amendment of, or
modification to, the Investor Agreements is pending or contemplated, and the
commitments contained in the Investor Agreements have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. The Investor Agreements are in full force and
effect and, to Parent's Knowledge, represent valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of the subscribers named therein to perform the obligations set
forth therein. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or
the Sponsor under any of the Investor Agreements that would result in (a) a

amend its obligations under thereunder, (b) with respect to the Parent
Preferred Subscription Agreement, any portion of the subscriptions thereunder
not being available on the Closing Date or (c) with respect to the Backstop

Section 1(a) thereof. To the Parent's Knowledge, neither it, Sponsor nor any
other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of
any Investor Agreement.

binding agreement solely due to binding provisions related to exclusivity,
expenses, confidentiality, choice of law or other similar matters);

  



  

(xvii) incur any Indebtedness or issue or sell any debt securities or
warrants or rights to acquire any debt securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or assume, guarantee, endorse or otherwise as an

directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Closing and the Group Companies'
failure to take any action prohibited by _Section 5.01(a)_ , as a result of
Parent not timely consenting to the notice required to be delivered by the
Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.01(a)_ , will not be a breach of
_Section 5.01(a)_.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.01(a)_ , no Group
Company that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company shall be
restricted from (i) paying to its sole equity holder parent Group Company

Representatives reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Parent 's
Representatives_") with reasonable access during normal business hours, and
upon reasonable notice, to the offices, properties, senior personnel, and all
financial books and records (including Tax records) of the Group Companies in
order for Parent to have the opportunity to make such investigation as it will
reasonably desire in connection with the consummation of the transactions

rights under this _Section 5.02_, Parent and the Parent's Representatives
will not be permitted to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the

the contrary, no such access or examination will be permitted to the extent
that it would require any Group Company to disclose information subject to
attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product privilege, conflict with
any third-party confidentiality obligations to which any Group Company is
bound, or violate any applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no access or examination provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.02_ will qualify or limit any representation or warranty set
forth herein or the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_.
Parent will indemnify and hold harmless the Group Companies from and against
any Losses that may be incurred by any of them to the extent arising out of or
related to the bad faith or gross negligence of Parent or the Parent's
Representatives in the use, storage or handling by Parent or the Parent's
Representatives of (i) any personally identifiable information relating to
employees or customers of any Group Company and (ii) any other information
that is protected by applicable Law (including privacy Laws) or Contract
and to which Parent or the Parent's Representatives are afforded access
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained therein, the
Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and the Company, dated September 17,
2016 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), will not terminate unless
the Closing occurs, and Parent is and will continue to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  



  

5.03.   _Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not a waiver, of the closing
conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_); _provided_ , that such efforts will
not require agreeing to any obligations or accommodations (financial or
otherwise) binding on a Group Company in the event the Closing does not
occur. No Group Company shall acquire a Person if such acquisition will delay
completion of SEC staff review of the Proxy Statement or the dissemination of
the Proxy Statement to holders of shares of Parent Common Stock.. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ will
limit, expand or otherwise modify in any way any efforts standard
explicitly applicable to any of the Company's obligations under this
Agreement.

solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or knowingly provide
any information to, any Person (other than Parent and the Parent's
Representatives) concerning an IPO, recapitalization or refinancing of any
member of the Group Companies (other than as contemplated by this
Agreement), any purchase of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock or any
merger, sale of a majority of the assets of the Group Companies or similar
transactions involving the Group Companies or their respective securities

transaction, an " _Alternative Transaction_ "); _provided_ that this _Section
5.04 _will not apply to the Company or the Stockholder Representative in
connection with Stockholder communications related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, cease and cause to be terminated (a) any existing
discussions, communications or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent
and the Parent's Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Alternative Transaction and (b) any such Person's and its authorized
Representatives' access to any electronic data room granted in connection
with any Acquisition Transaction. In the event that any unsolicited
inquiry is made by a potential party to an Alternative Transaction, whether
formal or informal, the Company will promptly notify Parent that such contact
has occurred and provide the name of the Person who made such contact and if
terms were proposed, what terms were so proposed.

customary payoff letter or letters or other payoff documentation

the Organizational Documents in the form of _Exhibit H_ attached hereto (the
" _Written Stockholder Consent_ ").

  



  

5.07.   _Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock_. Within six (6) hours
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will

5.08.   _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date hereof
the Company becomes aware of any fact or condition arising after the date
hereof that constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in _Article III_ or of any covenant that would cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_, as
applicable, not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date, the Company will
disclose in writing to Parent such breach. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, unless Parent provides the Company with a
termination notice within ten (10) days after disclosure of such breach by
the Company (which termination notice may be delivered only if Parent is
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)_), Parent
will be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Agreement or prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_.

  



  

5.09.   _Section 280G Approval_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain waivers (the "
_Waivers of Parachute Payments_ ") from each Person who has a right to any
payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would be deemed to constitute
"parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and as to
which such Person waives his or her rights to some or all of such payments
and/or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") applicable to such Person so
that no remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to such Person will be
deemed to be "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code), and (b) no sooner than the day after the day all the Waivers of
Parachute Payments with respect to which the approval of payments and/or
benefits by the Stockholders is to be solicited become effective, solicit the
approval of the Stockholders to the extent and in the manner required under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of any Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to
soliciting such waivers and approvals, the Company will provide the final
drafts of such waivers and such stockholder approval materials to Parent for
Parent's review and comment, and the Company will consider reasonable comments
of Parent thereon and consult with the Parent with respect thereto, in each
case in good faith, including timely providing any material supporting
information, calculations and documents. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the Stockholders was
solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.09_.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not be required to conduct a
stockholder vote pursuant to this _Section 5.09_ unless it is able to obtain
Waivers of Parachute Payments.

reasonable prior notice to the Stockholder Representative and offering to
surrender to the Stockholder Representative such books and records or any
portion thereof that Parent or the Surviving Company may intend to destroy,
alter or dispose of.

  



  

6.02.   _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date hereof
Parent has Knowledge of any fact or condition that constitutes a breach of any
representation or warranty made in Article IV or any covenant that would
cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section
8.02(b)_, as applicable, not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date, Parent
will disclose in writing to the Company such breach. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, unless the Company provides
Parent with a termination notice within ten (10) days after disclosure of
such breach by Parent (which termination notice may be delivered only if the
Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01(d)), the Company will be deemed to have waived its right to terminate
this Agreement or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.02(b)_.

  



  

6.03.   _Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein

Agreement and the Closing Date, Parent and the Merger Sub will use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions

6.05.   _Financing_. Each of Parent and the Merger Sub will use its
reasonable best efforts, and will cause its Affiliates to use reasonable best
efforts to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Debt Financing as promptly as possible following the date hereof. Such
reasonable best efforts will include taking the following actions: (a)

Financing Commitment, (b) using its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment, (c) using its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, including the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any related
flex provisions) so that such agreements are in effect no later than the
Closing, (d) using its reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under
the Debt Financing Commitments, and (e) using its reasonable best efforts to
satisfy all the conditions to the Debt Financing and the definitive
agreements related thereto that are within its control. In the event that all
conditions to the Debt Financing Commitment have been satisfied or waived
(other than the consummation of the Merger) or, upon funding will be
satisfied, and satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's and the Merger Sub's
obligations hereunder, each of Parent, the Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources
to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing, to the extent the proceeds
thereof are required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Merger Sub will, as promptly
as practicable after obtaining knowledge thereof, give the Company and the
Stockholder Representative written notice of any (i) breach, default (or any
event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default),
termination or repudiation by a Financing Source or any party to any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing, (ii) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any definitive documents related

communication from any Financing Source with respect to any actual or
threatened termination of the Debt Financing by the Financing Sources, (iv)
amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Debt Financing Commitment
(other than the exercise of certain flex provisions therein), or (v)
change, circumstance or event, in each case which causes Parent and the
Merger Sub to believe that they will not be able to timely obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
Financing Sources or sources contemplated by the definitive documents related
to the Debt Financing. Upon request, Parent and the Merger Sub will keep the
Company and the Stockholder Representative informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of their efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, including by
providing copies of all definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing
and all information reasonably requested by the Company and the Stockholder
Representative and available to Parent and the Merger Sub relating to any
circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

   

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Neither Parent or the Merger Sub nor their respective Affiliates will amend,
modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt Financing
Commitment (other than with respect to the exercise of certain flex provisions
therein) without the prior written approval of the Company, in each case that
would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, (B) impose
new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to funding the Debt Financing, (C) reasonably be expected to (1)
delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date or
(2) adversely impact the ability of Parent and the Merger Sub to enforce
their rights against the Persons providing the Debt Financing or any other
parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto, or (D) make it less likely that the Debt Financing would be
funded (including by making the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing
less likely to occur) or otherwise prevent or delay or impair the ability or
likelihood of Parent and the Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or adversely affect the ability of Parent and the Merger
Sub to enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment relative to the ability of Parent and the Merger Sub to enforce
their rights against such other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment as in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that Parent and the Merger Sub may
modify, supplement or amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof. In the
event that new commitment letters are entered into in accordance with any
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt
Financing Commitment permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.05_, such new
commitment letters will be deemed to be a part of the "Debt Financing" and
deemed to be the "Debt Financing Commitment" for all purposes of this
Agreement. Until the Closing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing if Parent obtains actual knowledge of any fact, change, condition,
circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event that would result or
reasonably be likely to result in all or a material portion of the Debt
Financing not being available to Parent at Closing.

  



  

In the event that, notwithstanding the use of Parent's reasonable best
efforts to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.05_ , funds in the
amounts set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, or any portion thereof,
become unavailable, or if Parent and the Merger Sub reasonably determine that
such funds may become unavailable to them on the terms and conditions set
forth therein, Parent and the Merger Sub will (x) notify the Company and the
Stockholder Representative in writing thereof, (y) use reasonable best
efforts to obtain substitute financing on terms (including structure,
covenants and pricing) not materially less beneficial to Parent and the
Merger Sub with lenders reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Merger Sub
(that does not impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend
or modify conditions precedent to funding in a manner, when considered with
the other conditions taken as a whole, that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent and the Merger Sub to
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement) sufficient to
enable Parent and the Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with its terms (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and (z)
use reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter that
provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution thereof,
deliver to the Company and the Stockholder Representative true, complete and
correct copies of the new commitment letter (in redacted form removing only

connection with the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article X_. Parent shall extend the Offer for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC, Nasdaq or the
respective staff thereof that is applicable to the Offer. Nothing in this

Offer beyond the Outside Date (as the same may be extended in accordance with
_Section 13.22(c)_) or (ii) be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict
in any manner the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Article X_.

  



  

(c)  Without limitation, in the Proxy Statement, Parent shall (i) seek (A)
adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations,
including the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, (B) adoption and approval of
the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, (C) adoption
and approval of an omnibus equity incentive plan, the form of which is
attached as _Exhibit I_ attached hereto (the " _Management Incentive Plan_

restricted stock units, restricted stock or other equity-based awards, (D)
to elect, and designate the classes of, the members of the Parent Board, and

accordance with the applicable proxy solicitation rules set forth in the
Exchange Act (such Proxy Statement and the documents included or referred to
therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements, amendments and/or exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ").
Except with respect to the information provided by the Company for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement and the other Offer Documents, Parent shall ensure
that, when filed, the Proxy Statement and the other Offer Documents will
comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. Parent shall cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated as promptly as practicable to holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock as and to the extent such dissemination is required by United
States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder or otherwise (the " _Federal Securities Laws_ "). The
Company shall promptly provide to Parent such information concerning the
Company and the Stockholders as is either required by the Federal Securities
Laws or reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in the Offer Documents,
including, if applicable, the information described in clauses (c) through
(e) of the definition of Required Information; _provided_  that in no event
shall the information described in clauses (c) and (d) of the definition of
Required Information be provided later than the respective time periods set
forth in such clauses. Subject to the Company's and the Stockholders'
compliance with the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the
information provided or to be provided by the Company or the Stockholders for
inclusion in the Offer Documents, Parent shall cause the Offer Documents to
comply in all material respects with the Federal Securities Laws. Parent
shall provide copies of the proposed forms of the Offer Documents (including
any amendments or supplements thereto) to the Company such that the Company
is afforded a reasonable amount of time prior to the dissemination or filing
thereof to review such material and comment thereon and Parent shall
reasonably consider in good faith any comments of such Persons. Parent and
the Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents and promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by the Federal Securities Laws. Parent shall amend or
supplement the Offer Documents and cause the Offer Documents, as so amended
or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the
holders of shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Federal Securities Laws and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Parent Governing Documents.
Parent shall provide the Company with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform the Company of any material oral comments, that Parent or any
of its Representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give
the Company a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and
comment on any proposed written or material oral responses to such comments.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to "clear" comments from the
SEC and its staff with respect to the Offer Documents and to permit the
Company to participate with Parent or its Representatives in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC and its staff regarding the Offer Documents. The
Company shall, and shall cause each of the Group Companies to, make their
respective directors, officers and employees and use commercially reasonable
efforts to make their accountants, in each case upon reasonable advance
notice, reasonably available to Parent and its Representatives in connection
with the drafting of the public filings with respect to the Merger (including
the Offer Documents) and responding in a timely manner to comments from the
SEC or its staff.

(d)  If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent, or the Group Companies, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Offer Documents, so that such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify each other party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of Parent.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, Parent may make any public filing with respect to the
Merger to the extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

7.02.   _Regulatory Filings_.

  



  

Within twenty (20) days after the date hereof, with respect to the Merger the
parties hereto shall make, or cause to be made, the filing required (if any)
of each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
hereto shall make, or cause to be made, as promptly as practicable, all
filings necessary to obtain all Regulatory Approvals other than the HSR
Approval. The parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to: (a)
respond to any requests for additional information made by any Governmental
Entity; (b) provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any filing, submission, response to an information request or
other (verbal or written) communication to be submitted or made to any
Governmental Entity and such receiving party shall consider any such received
comments in good faith; (c) advise the other party (and, where applicable,
provide a copy) of any written or verbal communications that it receives from
any Governmental Entity in respect of such filings (including in respect of
any supplementary filings or submissions) and otherwise in connection with
satisfying the Regulatory Approvals; and (d) provide the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in any meetings with any Governmental
Entity (subject to any opposition by a Governmental Entity to a particular
party's participation in such meeting) and participate in, or review, any
material communication before it is made to any Governmental Entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party has the right to redact or otherwise
exclude a party from receiving any confidential competitively sensitive
information required to be shared under this _Section 7.02_,  _provided_
that such other party's external counsel shall be entitled to receive such
confidential competitively sensitive information on an external counsel only
basis. The Parties shall: (i) not agree to an extension of any waiting period
or review being undertaken by a Governmental Entity without the other Party's
prior written consent; (ii) cause any applicable waiting periods to terminate
or expire at the earliest possible date; and (iii) resist vigorously, at their
respective cost and expense, any Order challenging the completion of the
Merger or any temporary or permanent injunction which could delay or prevent
the Closing, all to the end of expediting consummation of the Merger
contemplated herein. Without limiting the generality of Parent's undertaking
pursuant to this _Section 7.02_, Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Law or competition or trade regulation
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other party so as
to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as possible, including proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, order, hold separate orders,
or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its assets,
properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be
acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement as are required to be divested in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing
the consummation of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing. Any
filing fee required in connection with seeking the Regulatory Approvals shall
be paid fifty percent (50%) by Parent as a Parent Transaction Expense and
fifty percent (50%) by the Company as a Company Transaction Expense.

7.03.   _Shareholder Vote; Recommendation of the Parent Board_.

  



  

The Parent Board shall, subject to its fiduciary duties, recommend that
Parent's stockholders vote in favor of adopting this Agreement and
consummating the Merger, and Parent shall, subject to the fiduciary duties of
the Parent Board, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Prior
to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_, neither
the Parent Board nor any committee or agent or representative thereof shall

recommendation in favor of this Agreement and the Merger, (ii) approve,

reasonable efforts that are necessary or desirable for Parent to remain
listed as a public company on, and for shares of Parent Common Stock to be
tradable over, the applicable Nasdaq market(s).

  



  

7.05.   _Operations of Parent Prior to the Closing_.

  



  

Between the date hereof and the Closing, and except as contemplated by this
Agreement or with the prior approval of the Company, Parent shall not take
any of the following actions:

  



  

(a)  make any amendment or modification to any of the Parent Governing
Documents;

Company regarding any Group Company, its business or the Merger;

  



  

(i)  amend, waive or terminate, in whole or in part, any Founder Voting
Agreement;

  



  

(j)  establish any Subsidiary or acquire any interest in any asset; or

  



  

(k)  enter into any agreement or commitment to do any of the foregoing, or

Founder Voting Agreement, Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
Company has the right to cause Parent to enforce Parent's rights and perform
Parent's obligations under the Founder Voting Agreement, and Parent further
acknowledges that money damages would not be an adequate remedy at Law if any
Founder Stockholder (as defined in the Founder Voting Agreement) fails to
perform in any material respect any of such Founder Stockholder's obligations
under the Founder Voting Agreement and accordingly, upon the written request
of the Company, Parent shall, in addition to any other remedy at Law or in
equity, seek an injunction or similar equitable relief restraining such
Founder Stockholder from committing or continuing any such breach or
threatened breach or to seek to compel specific performance of
the obligations of any other party under the Founder Voting Agreement,
without the posting of any bond, in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Founder Voting Agreement in any court of the United States or any State
thereof having jurisdiction, and if any action should be brought in equity to
enforce any of the provisions of the Founder Voting Agreement, Parent shall
not raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at Law.

  



  

7.07.   _Founder Letter Agreement_. Parent shall enforce to the fullest
extent permitted by Law the restrictions on transfer of the 4,989,977 shares
of Parent Common Stock acquired by the Sponsor and other Parent insiders prior
to the consummation of the IPO (the " _Founder Common Stock_ ") as well as
the waiver of each of the Founder Stockholders' (as defined in the Founder
Letter Agreement) respective rights to redeem such shares of Founder Common
Stock, in accordance with that certain letter agreement, dated as of July 22,
2015 (the " _Founder Letter Agreement_ "), among Parent, the Sponsor and the
individuals party thereto.

  



  

   

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.08.   _No Claim Against Parent Trust_. The Company acknowledges that it has
read the Prospectus and that Parent has established the Parent Trust from the
proceeds of its initial public offering (" _IPO_ ") and from certain private
placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO for the benefit of Parent's
public stockholders (" _Public Stockholders_ ") and certain parties
(including the underwriters of the IPO) and that, except for a portion of the
interest earned on the amounts held in the Parent Trust, Parent may disburse
monies from the Parent Trust only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the
event they elect to redeem the Parent Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of Parent's initial business combination (as such term is used
in the Prospectus) (" _Business Combination_ "), (b) to the Public
Stockholders if Parent fails to consummate a Business Combination within
twenty-four months from the closing of the IPO, (c) any amounts necessary to
pay any Taxes and for working capital purposes or (d) to, or on behalf of,
Parent after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination.
The Company hereby agrees that, it does not now and shall not at any time
hereafter have (other than its rights upon Closing) any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Parent Trust or
distributions therefrom, or make any claim prior to Closing against the
Parent Trust, regardless of whether such claim arises based on
contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all
such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Claims_ "). The
Company hereby irrevocably waives any Claims it may have against the Parent
Trust (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with
Parent and will not, prior to the Closing, seek recourse against the Parent
Trust (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including for an alleged breach of this Agreement). For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the waivers
under this _Section 7.08_ will continue to apply at and after the Closing or
termination of this Agreement (as applicable) to distributions made to
redeeming Public Stockholders and for transaction expenses paid. The Company
agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this
Agreement and specifically relied upon by Parent to induce it to enter into
this Agreement. This _Section 7.08_ shall not limit the Company's right to
seek specific performance against Parent pursuant to _Section 13.22_,
including the right to seek specific performance against Parent to
require Parent to take such actions contemplated by this Agreement subject to
the satisfaction of Parent's conditions to the Closing in _Section 8.01_,
and to comply with the terms of the Parent Trust Agreement, including
distribution of funds from the Parent Trust upon the Closing in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

7.09.   _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date hereof through
the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Parent will not
take any action to knowingly initiate, solicit or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or knowingly provide any information to, any Person (other
than the Company and the Company's Representatives) concerning any alternative
business combination transaction involving Parent, including any purchase or
sale of equity or assets of Parent or any other Person or a merger,
combination or recapitalization of Parent or any Subsidiary thereof (each such
transaction, a " _Parent Acquisition Transaction_ "); _provided_ that this
_Section 7.09_ will not apply to Parent in connection with communications to
its stockholders related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions, communications or negotiations with any
Person (other than the Company and the Company's Representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Parent Acquisition Transaction.

properties and assets or stock or other equity interests to any Person, then
and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Company, as the case may be (or their respective successors and assigns),

occurred on or before the Closing Date. Fifty percent of the cost of the
insurance policy shall be treated as a Company Transaction Expense and fifty
percent of the cost of the insurance policy shall be treated as a Parent
Transaction Expense.

virtue of the approval of the requisite holders of capital stock of this
Agreement, all of the Stockholders collectively and irrevocably constitute
and appoint the Stockholder Representative as their agent and representative
to act from and after the date hereof and to do any and all things and

binding on the Stockholders.

  



  

(b)   _Authorization_. Notwithstanding _Section 11.01(a)_ , in the event that
the Stockholder Representative desires further authorization or advice from
the Stockholders on any matters concerning this Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative will be entitled to seek such further authorization from the
Stockholders prior to acting on their behalf. In such event, each
Stockholder will vote based on each such Person's Pro Rata Share and the
authorization of a majority of such Persons will be binding on all of the
Stockholders and will constitute the authorization of the Stockholders. The
appointment of the Stockholder Representative is coupled with an interest and

(c)   _Legal Proceedings by the Stockholder Representative; Resignation;

Stockholder Representative will not have any liability for any amount owed to
Parent pursuant to this Agreement, if any, including under _Section 9.01_.
The Stockholder Representative will not be liable to the Company, Parent, the
Merger Sub or any other Person in his or its capacity as the Stockholder
Representative, for any liability of a Stockholder or otherwise, or for
anything that he or it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this
Agreement. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable to the
Stockholders, in his or its capacity as the Stockholder Representative,
for any liability of a Stockholder or otherwise, or for any error of
judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted by him or it in good

jurisdiction. The Stockholder Representative may seek the advice of legal
counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any
of the provisions of this Agreement or his or its duties or rights hereunder,
and he or it will incur no liability in his or its capacity as the Stockholder
Representative to Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders and
will be fully protected with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered
by him or it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel. The
Stockholder Representative will not, by reason of this Agreement, have a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Stockholder, except in respect of
amounts received on behalf of the Stockholders.

  



  

(e)   _Reimbursement of Stockholder Representative_. After the Closing, the
Company agrees to promptly reimburse the Stockholder Representative for up to
$300,000 in the aggregate of reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses the
Stockholders Representative actually incurs in serving as the Stockholder
Representative for the purposes stated in this Agreement. Other than such
reimbursement for its out-of-pocket expenses, the Stockholder Representative
will not be compensated or otherwise entitled to payment for
providing services hereunder. Promptly following the Exchange Agent's
issuance of the 2019 Earnout Shares to the Common Stockholders or the
determination that no 2019 Earnout Shares are to be issued to the Common
Stockholders pursuant to Annex I hereto, as applicable, the Stockholder
Representative will no longer be entitled to such reimbursement. The
Stockholder Representative may be reimbursed for expenses incurred by the
Stockholder Representative acting in his or its capacity as such. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Stockholder will, only to the extent of such
Stockholder's Pro Rata Share thereof, indemnify and defend the
Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless
against any Loss, damage, cost, Liability or expense actually incurred
without fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Stockholder
Representative (as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction) and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance, performance or administration of the Stockholder Representative's
duties under this Agreement. Any expenses or taxable income incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in connection with the performance of his or its
duties under this Agreement will not be the personal obligation of the
Stockholder Representative but will be payable by and attributable to the
Stockholders based on each such Person's Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative will be entitled and is hereby granted the right to set off
and deduct any unpaid or non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied
Liabilities incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the
performance of his or its duties hereunder from amounts actually delivered to
the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement. The Stockholder
Representative may also from time to time submit invoices to the Stockholders
covering such expenses and Liabilities, which will be paid by the Stockholders
promptly following the receipt thereof on a _pro rata_ basis based on their
respective Pro Rata Share. Upon the request of any Stockholder, the
Stockholder Representative will provide such Stockholder with an accounting of
all expenses and Liabilities paid by the Stockholder Representative in his or
its capacity as such.

13.12. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents referred

13.18. _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and Schedules hereto will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to

of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

13.19. _Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a)  Any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby will be brought and determined exclusively in
the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; _provided_ that if

Proceeding will be brought exclusively in the United States District Court

courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Legal
Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Legal Proceeding in any such court or that any such Legal
Proceeding that is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be served on any
Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in _Section 13.06_ will be deemed effective
service of process on such Party.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting _Section 13.19(a)_,
each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Legal
Proceeding, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the financing sources under the Debt Financing Commitment or in any
way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions

relating in any way to the debt commitment letters or any other letter or
agreement related to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than any State or Federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, and any appellate court thereof and each
Party hereto (v) submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (w)

or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective address
provided in _Section 13.06_ shall be effective service of process against
them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court; (x) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; (y)
acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that a final judgment in any such Legal
Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law; and (z)

13.20. _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

13.21. _No Vicarious Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, all liabilities and obligations arising out of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be limited to the
parties to this Agreement, and a Person that is not a party to this Agreement
will not have any liability or obligation hereunder or with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

13.22. _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would occur and that the
Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, in addition to any
other remedies available under this Agreement, the Parties agree that, prior
to the termination of this Agreement, each Party will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent the other Party's breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including Parent's
or the Company's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement if required to do so hereunder). Each Party agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and hereby waives (i) any defenses in any Legal Proceeding for an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, including the
defense that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity and (ii) any requirement under Law to post a bond, undertaking or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

(b)  In no event will the exercise of the Company's right to seek specific
performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this _Section 13.22_
reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Company's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Sections 10.01_ and _10.02_.

  



  

(c)  To the extent any Party brings any Legal Proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date will automatically be extended to (i)
the 20th (twentieth) Business Day after such Legal Proceeding is no longer
pending or (ii) such other date established by the court presiding over
such Legal Proceeding.

13.23. _Waiver of Conflicts_.

  



  

(a)  Recognizing that Vinson and Elkins LLP (" _V andE_") has acted as legal
counsel to the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that VandE may act as
legal counsel to Parent, the Surviving Company and one or more of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing, each of Parent and the Surviving Company
(including on behalf of the Surviving Company's Subsidiaries) hereby waives,
on its own behalf, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts
that may arise in connection with VandE's representing Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences by or among the Group
Companies and its Affiliates in the course of the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the
Company. Accordingly, Parent and the Surviving Company, as the case may be,
will not have access to any such communications, or to the files of VandE
relating to such engagement, whether or not the Closing will have occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(a) the Company will be the sole holder of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to such engagement, and none of Parent, the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries will be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files
of VandE in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only
the Company and its Affiliates (and not Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) will hold such property rights, and (c) VandE will have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
or files to Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between VandE and any of the Group
Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a Party to this Agreement or any
of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, Parent and the Surviving
Company (including on behalf of its Subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by VandE
to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent, the
Surviving Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Company.

  



  

(b)  Recognizing that Sidley Austin LLP (" _Sidley_ ") and Ellenoff Grossman
and Schole LLP (" _EGS_ ") has each acted as legal counsel to Parent, Merger
Sub, Sponsor, certain Parent Securityholders and certain of their
respective Affiliates prior to the Closing, and that Sidley and EGS may act
as legal counsel to Parent, the Surviving Company and one or more of its
Subsidiaries, Sponsor, certain Parent Securityholders and certain of their
respective Affiliates after the Closing, each of Parent and the Surviving
Company (including on behalf of the Surviving Company's Subsidiaries) hereby
waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with each of Sidley's and EGS'
representing Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Sponsor, any Parent Securityholder and any of their respective
Affiliates after to the Closing. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences by or among Parent, Merger Sub, Sponsor, Parent
Securityholders or their respective Affiliates in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
Sponsor, such Securityholder or such Affiliate (and not to Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries). Accordingly, Parent and the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, will not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Sidley or EGS relating to such engagement,
whether or not the Closing will have occurred. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) Sponsor or the
applicable Parent Securityholder and its Affiliates (and not Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of
Parent, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will be a holder thereof,
(b) to the extent that files of each of Sidley and EGS in respect of such
engagement constitute property of the client, only Sponsor, the
applicable Parent Securityholder or their respective Affiliates (and not
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will hold such
property rights and (c) each of Sidley and EGS will have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to Parent
after the Closing and before or after the Closing, the Surviving Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Sidley and EGS (as applicable) and Parent and Merger Sub before the
Closing and after the Closing, the Surviving Company and any of the Group
Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a Party to this Agreement or any
of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, Parent and the Surviving
Company (including on behalf of its Subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by
Sidley and EGS to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Parent, the Surviving Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of Sponsor.

13.24. _No Recourse_. Except in the case of fraud, all actions, claims,
obligations, liabilities or causes of actions (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute whether by or through

 _Annex I_

  



  

Earnout Merger Consideration 
  
 2017 Earnout Shares, 2018 Earnout Shares and 2019 Earnout Shares

  



  

This  _Annex I_ sets forth the terms for the calculation of the number (if
any) of 2017 Earnout Shares, 2018 Earnout Shares and 2019 Earnout Shares, as
applicable. Terms used but not defined in this _Annex I_ have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the other parts of this Agreement to which this
_Annex I_ is a part.

  



  

1. If both (a) 2017 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is more than 90% of 2017 Target
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (such 90% baseline being referred to as the " _2017
Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_") and (b) the closing share price of
Parent Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days
within any consecutive 30-trading day period that occurs after the Closing
Date and on or prior to December 31, 2017 (such minimum share price threshold
for such time period being referred to as the " _2017 Threshold Share Price_
"), Parent shall issue up to five (5) million shares of Parent Common Stock
to the Common Stockholders as Earnout Merger Consideration. In such event,
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be issued to the Common
Stockholders pursuant to this paragraph 1 of this _Annex I_ as Earnout Merger
Consideration (such number of shares being referred to as the " _2017 Earnout
Shares_ ") shall be calculated as follows: (i) five (5) million shares if 2017
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is 100% or more of the 2017 Target Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA or (ii) if 2017 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is between 90% and
100% of 2017 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal (rounded to the nearest whole share of Parent Common
Stock) to (A) 5,000,000, _multiplied by_  (B) (x) (i) the 2017 Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA _minus_ (ii) $126,000,000 (such dollar amount being equal to
the 2017 Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA), _divided by_ (y) $14,000,000
(being the 2017 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less the 2017 Baseline Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA). For the sake of clarity, (a) in no event shall the
number of 2017 Earnout Shares exceed 5,000,000 in the aggregate, (b) in no
event shall any 2017 Earnout Shares be issued if either the 2017 Baseline Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA or the 2017 Threshold Share Price is not achieved, (c)
the number of 2017 Earnout Shares to be issued (rounded to the nearest whole
share) is determined by straight line interpolation in the event the 2017 Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA is greater than the 2017 Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA and less than 2017 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and (d) by way of
example, if the 2017 Threshold Share Price is achieved and the Company
achieves $133,000,000 in 2017 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the number of 2017
Earnout Shares will be 2,500,000. " _2017 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_"
means $140,000,000.

  



  

2. If both (a) 2018 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is more than 90% of 2018 Target
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (such 90% baseline being referred to as the " _2018
Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_") and (b) the closing share price of
Parent Common Stock equals or exceeds $14.00 per share for any 20 trading days
within any consecutive 30-trading day period that occurs during the 2018
calendar year (such minimum share price threshold for such time period being
referred to as the " _2018 Threshold Share Price_ "), Parent shall issue up to
five (5) million shares of Parent Common Stock to the Common Stockholders as
Earnout Merger Consideration. In such event, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock that will be issued to the Common Stockholders pursuant to this
paragraph 2 of this _Annex I_ as Earnout Merger Consideration (such number of
shares being referred to as the " _2018 Earnout Shares_ ") shall be
calculated as follows: (i) five (5) million shares if 2018 Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA is 100% or more of the 2018 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
or (ii) if 2018 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is between 90% and 100% of 2018
Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal (rounded to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock) to (A)
5,000,000, _multiplied by_  (B) (x) (i) the 2018 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
minus (ii) $153,000,000 (such dollar amount being equal to the 2018 Baseline
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA), _divided by_ (y) $17,000,000 (being the 2018
Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less the 2018 Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA). For the sake of clarity, (a) in no event shall the number of 2018
Earnout Shares exceed 5,000,000 in the aggregate, (b) in no event shall any
2018 Earnout Shares be issued if either the 2018 Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA or the 2018 Threshold Share Price is not achieved, (c) the number of
2018 Earnout Shares to be issued (rounded to the nearest whole share) is
determined by straight line interpolation in the event the 2018 Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA is greater than the 2018 Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
and less than 2018 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and (d) by way of example,
if the 2018 Threshold Share Price is achieved and the Company achieves
$161,500,000 in 2018 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the number of 2018 Earnout
Shares will be 2,500,000. " _2018 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_"
means $170,000,000.

  



  

   

Annex I-1

 



    



  

3. If both (a) 2019 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is more than 90% of 2019 Target
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (such 90% baseline being referred to as the " _2019
Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_") and (b) the closing share price of
Parent Common Stock equals or exceeds $16.00 per share for any 20 trading days
within any consecutive 30-trading day period that occurs during the 2019
calendar year (such minimum share price threshold for such time period being
referred to as the " _2019 Threshold Share Price_ "), Parent shall issue up to
five (5) million shares of Parent Common Stock to the Common Stockholders as
Earnout Merger Consideration. In such event, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock that will be issued to the Common Stockholders pursuant to this
paragraph 3 of this _Annex I_ as Earnout Merger Consideration (such number of
shares being referred to as the " _2019 Earnout Shares_ ") shall be
calculated as follows: (i) five (5) million shares if 2019 Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA is 100% or more of the 2019 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA or (ii)
if 2019 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is between 90% and 100% of 2019 Target Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
(rounded to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock) to (A) 5,000,000,
_multiplied by_ (B) (x) (i) the 2019 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA _minus_ (ii)
$180,000,000 (such dollar amount being equal to the 2019 Baseline Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA), _divided by_ (y) $20,000,000 (being the 2019 Target Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA less the 2019 Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA). For
the sake of clarity, (a) in no event shall the number of 2019 Earnout Shares
exceed 5,000,000 in the aggregate, (b) in no event shall any 2019 Earnout
Shares be issued if either the 2019 Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA or the
2019 Threshold Share Price is not achieved, (c) the number of 2019 Earnout
Shares to be issued (rounded to the nearest whole share) is determined by
straight line interpolation in the event the 2019 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
is greater than the 2019 Baseline Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and less than
2019 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and (d) by way of example, if the 2019
Threshold Share Price is achieved and the Company achieves $190,000,000 in
2019 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the number of 2019 Earnout Shares will be
2,500,000. " _2019 Target Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_" means $200,000,000.

availability of (a) the audited financial statements of Parent and its

of any business acquired by any of the Group Companies in 2017, which
financial statements shall be reviewed by Parent's independent public
accountant for the period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on the
effective date such business was so acquired, Parent and the Stockholder
