American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the '' _Seller Rights Agreement_
'') at a price per share of $13.50 net to the sellers in cash (such amount or
any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereafter
referred to as the '' _Offer Price_ '');

 

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Seller has (A) by unanimous vote of
the directors present (i) determined that the Offer and the Merger (as
defined below) are advisable, and in the best interest of the Seller and

be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I - THE OFFER

 

 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article IX hereof and none of the events set forth in _Annex I_ hereto
(the '' _Tender Offer_      

  _Conditions_ '') shall have occurred, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, Parent shall cause Purchaser to commence (within the meaning of
the Exchange Act) an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Seller
Common Stock at the Offer Price, and shall, upon commencement of the Offer
but after affording the Seller a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, file a Schedule TO and all other necessary documents with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the '' _SEC_ '') and make
all deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under
the Exchange Act, in each case in connection with the Offer (the '' _Offer
Documents_ ''), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Offer, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver of
the Tender Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause it
to, as soon as possible after the expiration of the Offer, accept
for payment, and pay for (after giving effect to any required
withholding Tax), all shares of Seller Common Stock validly tendered pursuant
to the Offer and not withdrawn (the date of acceptance for payment, the ''
_Acceptance Date_ '').

 

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Seller, the Purchaser shall not
decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, decrease the number of shares of Seller Common Stock sought to be
purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend
any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of shares
of Seller Common Stock. The Offer shall remain open until the date that
is twenty (20) Business Days after the commencement of the Offer (the ''
_Expiration Date_ ''), unless Purchaser shall have extended the period of
time for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and in accordance with, the two
succeeding sentences or as may be required by applicable Laws, in which event
the term '' _Expiration Date_ '' shall mean the latest time and date as the
Offer, as so extended, may expire; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser
may provide a subsequent offering period after the Expiration Date, in
accordance with Rule 14d-ll under the Exchange Act. If at any Expiration
Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions is not satisfied or waived by
Purchaser, Purchaser may extend the Offer from time to time; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, on the scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, (i) if the
waiting period under the HSR Act or under any material applicable foreign
statutes or regulations applicable to Merger, including clearance under the
German Act against Restraints of Competition, shall have not expired or been
terminated, Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time until the
expiration or termination under the HSR Act or any other material applicable
foreign statutes or regulations , including clearance under the German Act
against Restraints of Competition, (ii) if any of the Tender Offer
Conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) or (b) of _Annex I_ hereto shall
have occurred and be continuing, Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time
to time until the earlier of (A) five (5) Business Days after the time such
condition or conditions shall no longer exist or (B) such time at which the
matters described in such paragraphs (a) or (b) shall have become final and
non-appealable; or (iii) if all of the Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied
and more than 50% but less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Seller
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (as defined in _Annex I_ ) have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer, Purchaser shall have
the right, in its sole discretion, but not the obligation to extend
the Offer from time to time up to a maximum of ten (10) additional
Business Days in the aggregate. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall
affect any termination rights in Article IX. Subject to the terms of the
Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction of all the Tender
Offer Conditions as of any Expiration Date, Purchaser will accept for
payment and pay for all shares of Seller Common Stock validly

 
    

 tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after such Expiration Date of the Offer.

 

 1.2 _Seller Actions_.

 

(a) Seller shall, after affording Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, file with the SEC and mail to the holders
of shares of Seller Common Stock, as promptly as practicable on the date of
the filing by Parent and the Purchaser of the Offer Documents,
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the '' _Schedule 14D-9_ '') reflecting
the recommendation of the Seller board of directors that holders of shares of
Seller Common Stock tender their shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Schedule 14D-9 will set forth, and
the Seller hereby represents, that the Seller board of directors, at a
meeting duly called and held at which a quorum was present throughout, has
unanimously (i) determined that the Transaction, and each of the Offer
and the Merger, is advisable and in the best interests of the Seller and its
stockholders, (ii) approved the Offer and this Agreement in accordance with
the DGCL, (iii) recommended acceptance of the Offer and adoption of this
Agreement by the Seller's stockholders if such adoption is required by
applicable Laws (the '' _Seller Recommendations_ ''), and (iv) taken
all other action necessary to render Section 203 of the DGCL and the
Rights inapplicable to each of the Offer and the Merger; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Seller Recommendations may be withdrawn, modified or
amended only prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of Seller Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and in any case only to the extent permitted by
Section 7.2. Seller hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
of the Seller Recommendations.

 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Seller will promptly furnish the
Purchaser with mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting
beneficial owner lists and any available listing or computer list containing
the names and addresses of the record holders of the shares of Seller Common
Stock as of the most recent practicable date and shall furnish Purchaser with
such additional available information (including, but not limited
to, updated lists of holders of shares of Seller Common Stock and
their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions and non-
objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as the Purchaser
or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the
Seller's record and beneficial stockholders. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
Merger, Parent, the Purchaser and their Affiliates, associates, agents and
advisors, shall keep such information confidential and use the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, should the Offer terminate or if this Agreement
shall be terminated, will deliver to Seller all copies of such information
then in their possession.

 

 1.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, promptly upon the payment by
the Purchaser for shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next

 
    

 whole number, on the Seller board of directors as is equal to the product
of the total number of directors on the Seller board of directors (determined
after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of shares of Seller
Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates bears to the
total number of shares of Seller Common Stock then outstanding, and
the Seller shall, upon request of Parent, promptly take all
actions necessary to cause Parent's designees to be so elected, including,
if necessary, seeking the resignations of one or more existing directors;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be entitled to designate at least
a majority of the directors on the Seller board of directors (as long as
Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the outstanding
shares of Seller Common Stock of the Seller); _provided_ , _further_ , that
prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2), the Seller board
of directors shall always have at least two members who are not
officers, directors, employees or designees of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates ('' _Purchaser Insiders_ ''). If the number of directors who are
not Purchaser Insiders is reduced below two prior to the Effective Time, the
remaining director who is not a Purchaser Insider shall be entitled to
designate a Person to fill such vacancy who is not a Purchaser Insider and
who shall be a director not deemed to be a Purchaser Insider for all purposes
of this Agreement.

 

(b) Seller's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Seller board
of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder. Seller shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to
the Seller and its officers and directors as is required under such Section
and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3. Parent
will supply to Seller any information with respect to itself and
its officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section and Rule.

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
this Section 1.3 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or
termination of this Agreement by the Seller, any extension by the Seller of
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
Parent or the Purchaser or waiver of any of the Seller's rights hereunder,
will require the concurrence of at least one of the directors of Seller then
in office who is not a Purchaser Insider if such amendment,
termination, extension or waiver would be reasonably likely to have an
adverse effect on the minority stockholders of the Seller.

after consultation with Parent, to respond promptly to any comments made
by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy statement and cause
a definitive proxy statement (the '' _Proxy Statement_ '') to be mailed to
its stockholders and (y) to obtain the necessary approvals of the Merger and
this Agreement by its stockholders;

 

(iii) subject to the fiduciary duties of the Seller Board of Directors,

Section 2.6, in the event that Parent, the Purchaser or any other Subsidiary

ARTICLE III - EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE SELLER CAPITAL STOCK; 
EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

 3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of the capital stock of the Seller or capital stock of the Purchaser:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of the Purchaser_. Each share of the common stock of
the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall continue as one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. All shares of Seller Common Stock
that are owned by the Seller, and any shares of Seller Common Stock owned
by Parent or Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Seller Common Stock_.

 

(i) Subject to Section 3.2, each share of Seller Common Stock (other than
(x) shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(b), (y) shares
owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Seller or of
Parent (other than Purchaser), which shares shall remain outstanding except
that the number of such shares owned by such Subsidiaries shall be adjusted
in the Merger to maintain relative ownership percentages, and (z) Dissenting
Shares of Seller Common Stock (as defined in Section 3.3(a)) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Offer Price per share (the ''
_Merger Consideration_ ''). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Seller Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Seller Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section
3.2, without interest.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each share of Seller Common Stock that is
a restricted share (a '' _Seller Restricted Share_ '') immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, instead of being cancelled and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, become that number of Parent
Ordinary Shares

 
    

 (which shall be subject to the same restrictions as were applicable to the
restricted shares of Seller Common Stock from which they were converted) as
is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the product of the
Merger Consideration and the Euro Exchange Rate by (2) the closing price of
a Parent Ordinary Share on the Euronext Paris on the date of the Effective
Time; _provided_ that, with respect to any one holder of Seller Restricted
Shares, any fractional shares resulting from such division will be cashed out
for an amount of U.S. dollars in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by
the product of the closing price of a Parent Ordinary Share on the Euronext
Paris on the date of the Effective Time and the Dollar Exchange Rate. ''
_Euro Exchange Rate_ '' equals the Noon Buying Rate for Euros as announced by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the date on which the Effective
Time occurs, which for the avoidance of doubt shall be computed as Euros
per one U.S. dollar. '' _Dollar Exchange Rate_ '' shall be the Euro Exchange
Rate computed as U.S. Dollars per one Euro. Prior to the Effective
Time, Seller shall take or cause to be taken all corporate actions
necessary to effectuate the treatment of Seller Restricted Shares
contemplated by this Section 3.1(c). The Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to ensure that the Parent Ordinary Shares delivered
in exchange for the Seller Restricted Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form) with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares
issuable in exchange for the Seller Restricted Shares; _provided_ that, if a
Form S-8 is not available the Parent shall cause a Registration Statement on
such other form as is available to be filed and become effective covering the
issuance of such Seller Restricted Shares.

 

(d) _Treatment of Warrants_. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Warrant
Agreement dated September 8, 2003 (the '' _Warrant Agreement_ ''), effective
as of the Effective Time, the Warrant (as defined in the Warrant Agreement)
shall no longer represent the right to purchase shares of the Seller Common
Stock but shall represent solely the right to receive, upon exercise of such
Warrant (and payment of the applicable exercise price), cash in the amount of
the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Seller Common
Stock for which the Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Any such payments shall be subject to all applicable Tax
withholding requirements.

 

(e) _Seller Stock Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Seller Stock Option (other than options
granted under the Seller ESPP) that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Seller Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a right to
purchase from Seller or any other Person Parent Ordinary Shares in an amount
and at an exercise price determined as provided in this Section 3.1(e) (and
otherwise subject to the terms of the Seller Stock Plans (other than the
Seller ESPP) and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder) (a ''
_Reclassified Stock Option_ ''). The number of Parent Ordinary Shares to be
subject to each Reclassified Stock Option shall be equal to (w) the product
of (A) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such Seller
Stock Option immediately

 
    

 prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Merger Consideration and (C) the
Euro Exchange Rate, divided by (x) the closing price of a Parent Ordinary
Share on the Euronext Paris on the date of the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that any fractional shares resulting from such multiplication shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per Parent
Ordinary Share under each Reclassified Stock Option shall be expressed in
Euros and shall be equal to (1) the product of (w) the exercise price per
share of Seller Common Stock at which such Seller Stock Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time and (x) the
Euro Exchange Rate, divided by (2) the quotient obtained by dividing (y) the
product of the Merger Consideration and the Euro Exchange Rate by (z) the
closing price of a Parent Ordinary Share on the Euronext Paris on the date of
the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such exercise price shall be rounded up
to the nearest whole Euro cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller
Stock Option which is an ''incentive stock option'' shall be adjusted in a
manner consistent with Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or
renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. For
the sake of clarity, the vesting schedule for each of the Seller Stock
Options shall not be accelerated solely as a result of the Merger and such
Seller Stock Options shall remain subject to the existing vesting schedules
and other terms of the applicable grant.

 

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall take or cause to be taken all
corporate actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of Seller Stock
Options contemplated by this Section 3.1(e). The Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve a sufficient number of
Parent Ordinary Shares for delivery upon exercise of the Reclassified
Stock Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event within one (1) Business Day) the Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to
the Parent Ordinary Shares subject to such Reclassified Stock Options
that are eligible for registration on Form S-8, and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain
the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as any such Reclassified Stock Options remain outstanding.

 

(f) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Seller's 2005 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the '' _Seller ESPP_ '') shall be, with respect to the
current ''offering period'' thereunder, continue to be operated in
accordance with its terms for the remainder of such period. As soon as
practicable following the date hereof, Seller shall take or cause to be taken
all corporate actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the
Seller ESPP, no ''offering period'' shall be commenced following the date
hereof.

 

 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging
outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock for the Merger Consideration are
as follows:

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i)
designate, or cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is
reasonably acceptable to the Seller (the

 
    

 '' _Paying Agent_ '') and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Seller, with such Paying
Agent to act as agent for the payment or exchange in accordance with this
Article III of the Merger Consideration (such cash being referred to as the
'' _Exchange Fund_ ''). On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the
holders of Seller Common Stock. The Paying Agent shall make payments of the
Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any unrelated other
purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent (and shall use its best efforts to cause the Paying Agent to do so
by the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date of the Effective Time) to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Seller Common Stock (the '' _Certificates_ '') whose shares were converted
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the shares of Seller Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Seller Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Seller, payment may be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Stock_. The Merger
Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered (and
paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Seller
Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Seller Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Seller Common Stock nine months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Seller Common Stock

 
    

 who has not previously complied with this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look
only to the Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration.

 

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none
of the Parent, the Purchaser, the Seller, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Seller
Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any
agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be payable
to the Surviving Corporation.

 

(g)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Seller Common Stock or Seller Stock Options such amounts as it
reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable
provision of law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, the Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Seller Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, the Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 3.3 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Seller Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Seller
Stockholders who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the ''
_Appraisal Rights Provisions_ '') (i) have not voted in favor of adopting
and approving this Agreement, (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such shares, and (iii) have not effectively withdrawn, lost or
failed to perfect their rights to appraisal (collectively, the ''
_Dissenting Shares_ ''), will not be converted as described in Section 3.1,
but at the Effective

 
    

 Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall
represent the right to receive only those rights provided under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that all shares of Seller
Common Stock held by Seller Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect
or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such shares of Seller Common Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions
shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled and to have been converted,
as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
relating thereto, without interest, in the manner provided in Section 3.1.
Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to Dissenting Shares
(the '' _Dissenting Stockholders_ '') as described above will not be paid
as provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are provided
by the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) Seller shall give Parent and Purchaser prompt (and in any event within 10
days of receipt) notice of any demands received by the Seller for the
exercise of appraisal rights with respect to shares of Seller Common Stock
and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands, subject, prior to the Effective Time, to
consultation with Seller. Seller shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

 

(c) Each Dissenting Stockholder who becomes entitled under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive payment
therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation (but only
after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such shares of Seller
Common Stock shall be canceled.

 jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated

are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as currently
in effect.

 

(c) Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the

the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Parent and Purchaser, and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Seller), constitutes the valid and
binding obligations of the Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against the
Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and assuming that all consents, authorizations, permits, waivers
and approvals referred to in Section 4.3 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
have been obtained and all registrations, declarations, filings and

writ, decree or injunction applicable to the Parent or Purchaser or by
which any property or asset of the Parent or Purchaser is bound or
affected, except, with respect to (ii) above, for any such conflicts,

or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, or notifications to
any Governmental Authority are necessary in connection with (a)

would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (ii) such consents, authorizations,
waivers, approvals, filings, notices and registrations as are listed
in Section 4.3 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 

 4.4 _Broker 's Fees_. Neither the Parent nor Purchaser nor any of
their respective officers, directors, employees or agents has employed any
broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any fees or

 4.5 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation of any nature pending or, to the
knowledge of the Parent, threatened, against the Parent or any subsidiary of
the Parent or challenging the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which, if adversely determined,
would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Date and the date of the Effective Time will have, sufficient
cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately
available funds to enable it to pay the aggregate Offer Price and the

holders of Seller Common Stock and other securities of Seller (the ''
_Covered Securityholders_ ''). The Parent hereby represents and warrants
that all such amounts payable under the Parent Arrangement(s) (i) are being
paid or granted as compensation for future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) are not calculated
based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by
the applicable Covered Securityholder. Parent also hereby represents and
warrants that (i) the adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each
Parent Arrangement since the discussions relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby between the Seller and Parent began has
been approved as an employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the Seller
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act and the instructions thereto and (ii) the ''safe harbor'' provided
pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable thereto assuming that

harbor to be applicable.

all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities
laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published,
sent or given to the Seller's stockholders, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which

Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Seller or at the
time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not false
or misleading at the time and in light of the circumstances under which such
statement is made. The Proxy Statement (if any) will comply in all material
respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

 

 4.9 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, none of the
Parent Purchaser or any other person on behalf of the Parent or the Purchaser
makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to any other information provided to
the Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. None of
the Parent or the Purchaser or any other person on behalf of the Parent or
the Purchaser shall be held liable for damage, liability or loss resulting
from the distribution to the Seller, or the Seller' use of, any such
information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to the Seller in expectation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, unless any such information

disclosed in any Section or subsection shall be deemed to have been disclosed
for each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent
the relevance is reasonably inferable on the face of such disclosure),
the Seller hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser
as follows:

 
    

 5.1 _Corporate Organization_.

of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
corporate good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing
or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Seller
Material Adverse Effect. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Seller, copies of which have previously been made available to
the Parent, are true, complete and correct copies of such documents
as currently in effect.

 

(b) Other than as set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure

of the business conducted by it or the character or location of
the properties and assets owned, leased, or operated by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

(c) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents of each of the Seller's Subsidiaries that currently have
operations, copies of which have previously been made available to the
Parent, are true, correct and complete copies of such documents as currently

regarding required disclosure; (ii) designed and maintained a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

assets that could have a material effect on the Seller's financial
statements; (iii) with the participation of the Seller's principal executive
and financial officers, completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Seller's internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with

were effective using the framework specified in the Seller's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for such year ended; and (iv) to the extent required by
applicable Laws, disclosed in such report or in any amendment thereto any
change in the Seller's internal control over financial reporting

any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge or terminate a Seller Benefit Plan.

_Seller Contracts_ ''). All of the Seller Contracts are valid and in full
force and effect, except to the extent they have previously expired in
accordance with their terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect,

Seller Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Seller nor any of its
subsidiaries has, and to the knowledge of the Seller, none of the other
parties thereto have, violated any provision of, or committed or failed to
perform any act, and no event or condition exists, which with or without
notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions
of, any Seller Contract, except in each case for those violations and
defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 

 5.16 _Properties_.

 

(a) Neither the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries owns any real
property. Section 5.16(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all
real property leased, subleased or licensed to or by the Seller or any
of its subsidiaries, including any leases or subleases otherwise guaranteed
by Seller or its subsidiaries (all of the foregoing being collectively
referred to as '' _leases and subleases_ ''). The Seller has made available
to the Seller true, complete and accurate copies of the leases and subleases
(each as amended to date) relating to the leased property in Section 5.16(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. With respect to each such lease and
sublease:

 

(i) the lease or sublease is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
the Seller or its subsidiary, as the case may be, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating
to creditors' rights and general principles of equity;

 

(ii) neither the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of
the Seller, any other party, is in breach or violation of, or default under,
any such

 
    

 lease or sublease, and no event has occurred, is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Seller, is threatened, which, after the giving of notice or
the lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default by the Seller
or any of its subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of the Seller, any other
party under such lease or sublease;

 

(iii) neither the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries has assigned,
transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust or Encumbered any interest
in the leasehold or subleasehold, or further leased, subleased or licensed or
permitted any other Person to use or occupy the property subject
thereto; and

 

(iv) Seller or its subsidiaries have good, valid leasehold or subleasehold
title to the premises leased pursuant to the leases and subleases, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect, and there are no Encumbrances applicable to
the real property subject to any such lease or sublease, except for recorded
easements, covenants and other restrictions which do not, individually or in
the aggregate, materially impair the current uses or the occupancy by
the Parent or its subsidiary, as the case may be, of the property
subject thereto; and

 

(v) there are no consents, permissions or approvals by any third party
pursuant to any lease or sublease which may be required with respect to the
making of any lease or sublease by Seller or its subsidiaries, which have not
been obtained, except for those, the failure of which would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 5.16(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the Parent and its subsidiaries own good title, free and clear of
all Encumbrances, to all property and assets necessary to conduct
the business of the Seller as currently conducted, except for (i)
Encumbrances reflected in the Seller Balance Sheet included in the Seller SEC
Reports, (ii) Encumbrances or imperfections of title which do not detract
from the value or interfere with the present or presently contemplated use of
the assets subject thereto or affected thereby, (iii) Encumbrances for
current Taxes not yet due and payable and (iv) Encumbrances on the landlord's
interest in the premises (subject to Section 5.16(a)(iv) above). The Seller
and its subsidiaries, as lessees, have the right under valid and
subsisting leases to use, possess and control all personal property leased by
the Seller or its subsidiaries as now used, possessed and controlled by
the Seller or its subsidiaries, as applicable. All of the
machinery, equipment and other tangible personal property and assets owned or
used by the Seller and its subsidiaries are in good condition,
maintenance and repair, except for ordinary wear and tear, are useable in
the ordinary course of business, and are reasonably adequate and
suitable for the uses to which they are being put.

 

 5.17 _Environmental Liability_. There are, and have been, no
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions,
causes of action, private environmental investigations or
remediation activities or governmental investigations pending or, to
the Seller's knowledge, threatened, of any nature seeking to impose, or that
are reasonably likely to result in the imposition, on the Seller of any
liability or obligation arising under common law, under any lease or
sublease, or under any foreign, local, state or federal

 
    

 environmental statute, regulation, ordinance or Law including the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended, pending or threatened against the Seller, which liability or
obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the
Seller, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action
or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation
that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The Seller is not, and has not
been, subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any Governmental Authority or third party imposing
any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

taken all other requisite action such that the provisions of any anti-

of this Section 7.1(b), the use of ''reasonable best efforts'' by Parent
shall include proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (x) the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such product lines, assets or businesses of either party or
its subsidiaries or Affiliates and (y) restrictions or actions that after the
Closing Date would limit the Parent's or its Subsidiaries' (including the
Surviving Corporation's) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving
Corporation's) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, ''
_Regulatory Law_ '' means the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act
of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and all
other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other
laws, including any antitrust, competition or trade regulation laws that
are designed or intended to (i) prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening competition through merger or acquisition or (ii) protect
the national security or the national economy of any nation. Notwithstanding
anything else contained herein, the provisions of this Section 7.1 shall not
be construed to require Parent to undertake any efforts, or to take or
consent or commit to any action if the impact of such efforts, action,
consent or commitment would be reasonably expected, in the aggregate, to have
a Seller Material Adverse Effect if the affected assets and/or operations had
been Seller assets and/or operations (regardless of whether the assets or
operations are or were, prior to the transaction, Parent's assets or
operations or Seller's assets or operations). Neither Parent nor Seller
shall be required to agree to or affect any divestiture, hold separate
any business, or take any action that is not conditioned on the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) Subject to and in furtherance of Section 7.1(a) above, Parent and Seller
shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable,
each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to
Parent or Seller, as the case may be, and any of their respective
subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein.

 
    

(d) The Parent and the Seller shall promptly (i) advise each other of (and
the Parent or the Seller shall so advise with respect to communications
received by any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Parent or the Seller, as the
case may be) any written or oral communication from any Governmental
Authority or third party whose consent or approval is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) not
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filing, investigation, or inquiry concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless
it consults with the other party in advance, and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend;
(iii) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondences, filings,
and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that materials may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses
of the Seller, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and
(z) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns. Neither the Parent nor Seller shall consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

 

(e) The Seller agrees and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7.1, in connection with any filing or submission
required, action to be taken or commitment to be made by the Seller, the
Parent, or any of their respective subsidiaries to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Seller nor any of
the Seller's subsidiaries shall, without the Parent's prior written
consent, sell, divest, or dispose of any assets, commit to any sale,
divestiture or disposal of businesses, product lines, or assets of the Seller
and the Seller's subsidiaries or take any other action or commit to take any
action that would limit the Seller's, the Parent's or any of their respective
subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain
any of, their businesses, product lines or assets or Seller; provided that
the foregoing shall not relieve any party of its obligations under
this Agreement.

 

 7.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Seller agrees that, except as authorized or permitted in
this Section 7.2, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it
shall not authorize or permit any of its or its subsidiaries' directors,
officers, employees, affiliates, agents, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders, consultants or
representatives (collectively, '' _Representatives_ '') to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing or disclosing nonpublic
information or permitting access to personnel or facilities) any inquiries,
proposals, or the making of any offers (including without limitation any
offers to the Stockholders) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person (other than Parent) with respect to, or that
reasonably may be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter
into any agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve
or recommend or consummate an Acquisition Proposal.

 
    

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(a), the Seller or its Representatives may
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information to, and negotiate or
otherwise engage in discussions with, any Person that has made, after the
date of this Agreement, a bona fide unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if
and only to the extent that (i) the Acceptance Date has not occurred
and shares of Seller Common Stock have not been purchased in the Offer, (ii)
the board of directors of the Seller determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is,
or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (iii) prior to
furnishing any nonpublic information to such Person, the Seller shall enter
into a confidentiality agreement with such Person that contains
confidentiality and other provisions that are substantially similar to and no
less favorable to Seller than the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of
December 7, 2006 by and between Parent and Seller (the ''
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ''); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller shall
promptly provide Parent with any nonpublic information provided to any third
party under this Section 7.2(b) if such information has not previously been
provided to Parent together with a list of all other information provided to
any third party.

 

(c) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Seller shall cease immediately and
cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and promptly
request that all confidential information with respect thereto furnished on
behalf of the Seller be returned or destroyed. The Seller shall not modify,
amend or terminate, or waive, release or assign any material rights or claims
with respect to, any confidentiality or standstill provision entered into
with any third party.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2(e), neither the board of
directors of the Seller nor any committee of the board of directors of the
Seller may (i) withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
approval of the board of directors of this Agreement and the Seller
Recommendations, or fail to reaffirm the Seller Recommendations within four
(4) Business Days following a request by the Parent or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing,
including if effected by amendment to the Schedule 14D-9, an ''
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ''), (ii) authorize or permit the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any binding agreement (each, an ''
_Acquisition Agreement_ '') contemplating, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than a Confidentiality
Agreement in compliance with Section 7.2(b)).

 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(d), at any time prior to the purchase of any
share of Seller Common Stock into the Offer, the board of directors of the
Seller or a committee of the board of directors of the Seller may (1) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change if, the board of directors of the
Seller determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties to the Seller or its Stockholders under
applicable Law or (2), in response to a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made after the date hereof that was not solicited in violation of
Section 7.2(a), terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(h)
(including termination in connection with entering into an Acquisition
Agreement) if, after consultation with its financial advisors, the board of
directors of the Seller determines in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (a '' _Subsequent Determination_
''); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,

 
    

 that such actions may only be taken at a time that is after, (I) as
applicable, the fourth (4th) Business Day following Parent's receipt of
written notice from the Seller that the board of directors of the Seller is
prepared to take such action (which notice will specify the material terms of
any applicable Acquisition Proposal) and (II) at the end of such period, the
board of directors of the Seller determines in good faith, after taking into
account all amendments or revisions irrevocably committed to by Parent and
after consultation with its financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal relative to the Transaction, as
supplemented by any Counterproposal (it is agreed that if the third party
making the Acquisition Proposal referred to in this sentence modifies a
material term of its proposal, the four (4) Business Day period referred to
in this sentence shall recommence). During any such four (4) Business Day
period, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Seller a counterproposal
to such Acquisition Proposal (a '' _Counterproposal_ '') and the Seller
shall in good faith negotiate such Counterproposal with Parent.

 

(f) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall notify the
Parent promptly (but in any event within twenty four hours) of the receipt,
directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations,
proposals or expressions of interest with respect to, or that may reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (including a summary of the
material terms and conditions thereof, including price, and the identity of
the Person or Persons involved). The Seller shall keep the Parent reasonably
informed as to material developments in such discussions or negotiations
with, or modifications of the proposals of, other Persons.

 

(g) Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall prohibit the Seller from
complying with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the
good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Seller,
after consultation with its outside counsel, doing so would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Laws.

 

(h) For the purposes of this Agreement, '' _Superior Proposal_ '' shall mean
any bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (with all references
to 20% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal being treated as references
to 50% for these purposes) made by an unrelated third party which the board
of directors of the Seller determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor, to be more favorable to the Stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from a financial point of view,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of
such Acquisition Proposal, including the likelihood of consummation.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, '' _Acquisition Proposal_ '' means any
proposal or offer for a direct or indirect (i) merger, tender offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, business
combination or consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving the
Seller or a subsidiary(ies) thereof, (ii) sale, lease exchange, mortgage,
pledge, transfer or other acquisition or assumption of 20% or more of the
fair value of the assets of the Seller and subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in
one or a series of related transactions, or (iii) purchase, tender offer or
other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange
or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term ''beneficial ownership''
for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto
in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of securities representing twenty percent (20%) or
more of

 
    

 the voting power of the Seller;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the term ''
_Acquisition Proposal_ '' shall not include the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 7.3 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, the Seller, shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other representatives of the Parent, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records. The Seller also shall
provide the Parent with reasonable access to the Seller's officers, employees
and agents. Neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment
of any attorney-client or work product privilege. The parties hereto will use
commercially reasonably efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 

(b) With respect to all information furnished by Seller to Parent or
its representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply with, and
shall cause their respective representatives to comply with, all of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 7.4 _Employment and Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) _Provision of Benefits_. For the 12 month period commencing on the
Acceptance Date, the Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain the compensation levels, including base salary, cash-based incentive
opportunities (but not particular historic levels of achievement),
retirement, health and welfare benefits, but not any stock-based benefits,
for the employees of the Seller who remain employed after the Effective Time
(the '' _Seller Employees_ '') at levels which are, in the aggregate,
comparable to those in effect for the Seller Employees on the date hereof.
The Parent will treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the
service of the Seller Employees with the Seller or any Subsidiary of the
Seller attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service
rendered to the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefits
including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum waiting periods
for participation, but not for benefit accrual (including minimum
pension amount) and eligibility for early retirement under any defined
benefit plan of Parent or eligibility for retiree welfare benefit plans or
as would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Parent shall cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations,
eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any
health or similar plan of the Parent to be waived with respect to the Seller
Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the
corresponding plan in which the Seller Employee participated immediately
prior to the Acceptance Date, and any deductibles paid by Seller Employee
under any of the Seller's or its Subsidiaries' health plans in the plan year
in which the Acceptance Date occurs shall be credited towards deductibles
under the health plans of the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent. The

 
    

 Parent will make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to
ensure such result. Except with respect to employees who have entered into
employment agreements with Seller or its Subsidiaries listed on Section
7.4(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and subject to Section 7.4(c)
hereof, the Seller Employees who remain employed after the Effective Time
shall be considered to be employed by the Parent ''at will'' and nothing
shall be construed to limit the ability of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment of any such Seller Employee at any
time.

 

(b)  _Continuation of Plans_. Subject to Section 7.4(a) hereof, the
Parent shall have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to
whether or when to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans
and programs of the Seller; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Parent shall
continue to maintain the Seller plans (other than stock-based plans) until
the Seller Employees are permitted to participate in the plans of the Parent
or any Subsidiary of the Parent in accordance with Section 7.4(a).

 

(c) _Existing Compensation Agreements_. The Parent shall honor, in
accordance with their terms, all compensation agreements listed in Section
7.4(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

(d) _Seller Change in Control Severance Pay and Retention Bonus Plan_. The
Parent shall maintain the Seller Change in Control Severance Pay and
Retention Bonus Plan, in accordance with the terms in effect as of the date
hereof, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date.
The estimated costs of the Severance Plan with respect to retention
and enhanced severance payments to ''Corporate Employees'' (as such term is
defined in the Severance Plan) previously provided to Parent are accurate in
all material respects.

 

(e) _Continuation of Employment_. No provision of this Section 7.4 shall
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Seller or any
subsidiary of the Seller in any respect, including in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) with the Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of the Parent's subsidiaries, and no provision of this Section 7.4
shall create such rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that
may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Seller Pension Plan,
Seller Benefit Plan, Seller Other Plan, or any employee program or any plan
or arrangement of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. No provision of this
Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or
terminate after the Effective Time any such plans or arrangements of the
Parent or any of its subsidiaries.

 

 7.5 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that any rights to indemnification or exculpation
now existing in favor of the directors or officers of the Seller and
the directors or officers of the Seller's Subsidiaries (the '' _Indemnified
Parties_ '' and, each, an '' _Indemnified Party_ '') as provided in their
respective organizational documents, in effect as of the date hereof and
the indemnification agreements set forth in Section 7.5 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Acceptance Date shall survive the Merger (and with respect to the Seller,
shall be reflected in the applicable organizational documents of such entity)

 
    

 and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years after
the Acceptance Date. During such period, the Parent shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any manner that
would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals
who at any time prior to the Acceptance Date were directors or officers of
the Seller or directors or officers of any Seller Subsidiary in respect of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Date
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), unless such modification is required by law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made either
prior to the Acceptance Date or within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and all such claims.

 

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Seller shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Laws and regardless of whether the Merger becomes
effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the Acceptance Date,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former
director or officer of the Seller and each Seller Subsidiary and each such
person who served at the request of the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary as a
director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the '' _Covered
Parties_ '') against all costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the Acceptance Date), whether civil, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in
their capacities as officers or directors, in each case occurring before
the Acceptance Date (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Seller
or Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to control the defense of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (ii) if Seller, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation does not elect to control the defense of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the Covered Party shall
be entitled to select counsel for the Covered Party, which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Seller or to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and the Seller or Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall pay the fees and expenses of such
counsel promptly after statements therefor are received (unless the
Surviving Corporation shall elect to defend such action), (iii) the Covered
Party shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iv) none of
the Seller, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(c) At or prior to the Acceptance Date, the Seller shall purchase a ''tail''
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (which by its terms
shall survive the Merger) for its directors and officers, which shall
provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years
following the Acceptance Date of not less than the existing coverage under,
and have other terms not materially less favorable on the whole to,
the insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Seller, so long as the aggregate cost is
not greater than 300% of the annual premium paid by the Seller for such
existing insurance. In the event that 300% of the annual premium paid by the
Seller for such

 
    

 existing insurance is insufficient for such coverage, the Seller may spend
up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with
such amount.

 

(d) The obligations under this Section 7.5 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to
whom this Section 7.5 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 7.5 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
7.5 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

 

(e) In the event Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

 

 7.6 _A_ _dditional Agreements_. In case at any time after the
Acceptance Date (including after the Effective Time) any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the Transaction or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to
the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective subsidiaries shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the
sole expense of, the Parent.

 

 7.7 _Advice of Changes_. The Parent and the Seller shall each
promptly notify the other party of any change or event having a Material
Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would otherwise be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.7
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

 

 7.8 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law
until Effective Time, neither the Parent nor the Seller shall, or shall
permit any of its subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make
any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law
or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or Nasdaq.

 

 7.9 _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Parent and the Seller agree that, in order
to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors
of the Seller who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act in connection with the Offer and the Merger, both prior
to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that such persons not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 7.9. Promptly after
the date hereof, the Seller shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause any dispositions of shares of Seller Common Stock resulting from the

 
    

 transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Seller to be exempt under rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(d) _No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality_. No order, injunction,

may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or
after the Seller Stockholder Approval:

_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may not terminate this Agreement

 if such failure to commence the Offer or accept for payment and pay for the
shares of Seller Common Stock is due to such party's material breach of this
Agreement;

 

(c) by Parent or the Company if the Offer is terminated or withdrawn
pursuant to its terms and the terms of this Agreement without any shares
of Seller Common Stock being purchased thereunder, other than due to
a breach hereof by the terminating party;

(e) by the Parent prior to the purchase of shares of Seller Common Stock

in this Agreement not being true and correct (without giving effect to
any limitation as to ''materiality'' or ''Material Adverse Effect'' or
similar terms set forth therein) except where the failure to be so true

a Parent Material Adverse Effect or would result in a failure by Parent or
Purchaser to perform in all material respects its obligations and covenants
required to be performed by it under this Agreement and (2) has not been
cured within 30 days following notice by the Seller or, if the Outside Date
is less than 60 days from the notice by the Seller, has not been or cannot

of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words ''include'', ''includes''

shall be construed to require the Seller or the Parent or any of their
respective subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any action which would violate
applicable Law, rule or regulation.

 

 10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 

 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with, the
exhibits and schedules hereto and any documents delivered by the parties
in connection herewith and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of

expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other person
any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 10.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue_. This Agreement shall

the Parent and the Seller hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware
and of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware (the ''
_Delaware Courts_ '') for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to
commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware
Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each
of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise
subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and
maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such party's agent for
acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be made
on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing
receipt validated by United States Postal Service constituting evidence
of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have
the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally with
the State of Delaware.

 

 10.8 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable

this Agreement and the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to

 
    

 substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each of
Parent and Purchaser may assign their rights and obligations hereunder to any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent to the extent Purchaser

regulatory authority or agency, domestic or foreign, other than the
application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer or
to the Merger, that would reasonably be expected to, directly or
indirectly: (i) make illegal or otherwise prohibit or materially
delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (ii) except to the
extent required by Section 7.1 of the Agreement, restrict, prohibit or
limit the ownership or operation by Parent or Purchaser or their

Seller in Section 5.13(k) of this Agreement shall not be true and correct or
(iii) any of the other representations and warranties of the Seller set forth
in this Agreement shall not be true and correct (without giving effect to
any limitation as to ''materiality'' or ''Material Adverse Effect'' or
similar terms set forth therein) except where the failure to be so true
and correct does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect,
in each of the cases provided under clause (i), (ii), and (iii) as if
such representations and warranties were made at the time of
such determination (except to the extent such representations and
warranties relate to an earlier date, in which case only as of such earlier

giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or the
Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion, in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement. The failure
by Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
