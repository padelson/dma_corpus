succeeding Business Day, or (b) on such other date, time or place as is agreed
to in writing by Purchaser and Seller; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no
event shall the parties be required to consummate the Transactions and effect

 **Section 1.3 _Closing Deliveries and Payments_**.

  



  

(a) _Transfer Documents_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser stock certificates representing all of the Shares (if the Shares are
certificated) duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly
endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer, and other proper documents of
assignments for all of the Shares to evidence transfer to Purchaser.

  



  

(b) _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account_. Prior to or at the

Account_ ") shall be established pursuant to the terms and conditions of an
escrow agreement by and among Purchaser, Seller and the Escrow Agent (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to each of
Purchaser and Seller. At the Closing, Purchaser shall deposit $5,000,000 (the
" _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") into the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  



  

(c) _Debt Payoff_. At the Closing, (i) Purchaser shall repay, or cause to
be repaid, on behalf of the Group Companies, all amounts necessary to

accordance with the applicable Payoff Letters (if any) provided by the Seller
to Purchaser pursuant to _Section _ _6.3(a)_ by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) designated in such Payoff Letters by the
holders of such Indebtedness and (ii) if any such holder cannot be presumed to
be a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser an applicable IRS Form W-8 for such holder.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) _Transaction Expenses_ _Payment_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall
pay, or cause to be paid (i) on behalf of the Group Companies, all Specified
Transaction Expenses in accordance with the Closing Statement and the Invoices

applicable Group Company to make payment of such expenses to such Continuing
Employees through payroll of the applicable Group Company after the Closing.

  



  

(e) _FIRPTA Certificate_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a duly executed certificate (substantially in the form of the sample
set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B)) certifying
that Seller or the applicable transferor is not a foreign Person; _provided_
that in the event of a change in Law or fact that, in Purchaser's reasonable
discretion after consultation with Seller, results in the foregoing
certificate being insufficient to avoid withholding under Section 1445 of the
Code (and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), Seller shall
provide a different certification (or certifications), in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, as is necessary to avoid withholding of Tax under
Section 1445 of the Code (and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder)
from any amounts payable to Seller under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , ** __** that the sole recourse for failing to deliver such
certificate or certification is to withhold under _Section_ _ _ _1.4_ to the
extent required.

  



  

(f) _Resignations_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver resignations
from the directors and managers (and, if requested by Purchaser at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any officers) of the Group
Companies effective as of the Closing.

  



  

(g) _Secretary 's Certificate_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, duly executed by the
secretary of Seller (i) attaching a true and correct copy of the resolutions
unanimously adopted by the shareholders of Seller authorizing the Transactions
in accordance with Section 351.400 of the Missouri Revised Statutes (the "
_Shareholder Approval_ ") and (ii) certifying that that such resolutions have
not been rescinded, revised, modified or withdrawn in any way and are in full
force and effect.

  



  

 **Section 1.4 _Withholding Rights_**. Purchaser, Seller, the Escrow
Agent and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except in the case of
payments treated as compensation for employment, the Person intending to
withhold shall notify the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding would be made in writing of its intention to deduct and withhold
such amounts and the reason therefor as soon as reasonably practicable (but at
least two (2) Business Days in advance of the applicable payment date, except
with respect to withholding resulting from Seller's failure to comply with
_Section 1.3(e)_ ), and such first Person and each of the applicable parties
shall cooperate in good faith to reduce the amount of, or eliminate the
necessity for, such withholding. To the extent amounts are so withheld and
timely paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, the withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. If any
withholding obligation may be avoided by such Person providing information or
documentation to Purchaser, Seller or the Escrow Agent, such information shall
be requested prior to any such withholding.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Article II 
  
  _Consideration; Post-Closing Adjustment_**

  



  

 **Section 2.1 _Consideration_**.

Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser a written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth:

  



  

(i) Seller's good faith estimates of (A) the Cash Amount (the " _Estimated
Cash Amount_ "), (B) the Indebtedness Amount (the " _Estimated Indebtedness

summary of the calculations made to arrive at such amounts);

  



  

(ii) a list of and, as applicable, payment instructions for the payment
of, the Shared Expenses and the Estimated Transaction Expenses; and

  



  

(iii) the calculation of the Closing Aggregate Consideration.

  



  

The Closing Statement shall be derived from the books and records of the Group
Companies and shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Closing Aggregate
Consideration_ " means (i) the Base Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the Estimated
Indebtedness Amount, _plus_ (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Net Working Capital Amount is greater than the Target Net Working Capital
Amount, _minus_ (iv) the amount, if any, by which the Target Net Working
Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount,
_plus_ (v) the Estimated Cash Amount, _minus_ (vi) the Estimated Transaction
Expenses, _minus_ (vii) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Final Closing Aggregate
Consideration_ " means (i) the Base Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the
Indebtedness Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2_ ,
_plus_ (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital Amount as
finally determined pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2_ is greater than the Target
Net Working Capital Amount, _minus_ (iv) the amount, if any, by which the
Target Net Working Capital Amount is greater than the Net Working Capital
Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2_ , _plus_ (v) the
Cash Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2_ , _minus_
(vi) the Transaction Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_2.2_ , _minus_ (vii) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 2.2 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_**.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event within
seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller a statement, together with reasonable supporting detail, showing the
calculation of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Net Working Capital
Amount and Transaction Expenses (the " _Preliminary Statement_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Cash Amount,
Indebtedness Amount and Net Working Capital Amount shall be determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, to the extent
consistent with GAAP, as were used in the preparation of the Latest GM Balance
Sheet and, in the case of FidelityLink, in the Latest FidelityLink Trial
Balances, except as otherwise set forth in the definitions of such terms
(including, in the case of the Indebtedness Amount, (1) to the extent
Indebtedness includes any non-GAAP items and (2) with respect to the Payoff
Debt, which shall be calculated to reflect the amounts that would be required
to satisfy and discharge in full such Indebtedness as of the Closing as set
forth in the Payoff Letters), and the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount,
Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital Amount shall be calculated
without giving effect to and shall not include (w) any changes in assets or
liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments, (x) any
transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside of the
ordinary course of business, (y) transactions or liabilities incurred by or at
the direction of Purchaser or its Affiliates not contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Excluded Amounts or (z) any other accounting
adjustments arising from or resulting as a consequence of the Transactions
(collectively, the " _Accounting Principles_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
any dispute as to whether the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount and Net Working
Capital Amount were determined in accordance with GAAP may be resolved
pursuant to this _Section_ _2.2_ , irrespective of whether such dispute may
also involve a claim for the breach of the representations and warranties made
by the Seller in _Section_ _4.3_. The Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount,
Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital Amount in the Preliminary
Statement shall be derived from the books and records of the Group Companies
and shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with the Accounting
Principles, consistently applied.

  



  

(b) Seller and its Representatives shall be permitted reasonable access
during normal business hours to review and obtain copies of the Group
Companies' books and records and any work papers related to the preparation of
the Preliminary Statement and the adjustments contemplated thereby. Seller and
its Representatives may make inquiries of Purchaser, the Group Companies and
their respective accountants regarding questions or disagreements, and
Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the Group Companies to use their,
reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants to cooperate with and respond
to such inquiries. At the reasonable request of Seller, Purchaser shall make
available its and the Group Companies' personnel to advise and assist the
Seller in its review of the Preliminary Statement and any objections or
disputes with respect thereto. If Seller has any objections to the Preliminary
Statement, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth its
objections thereto, which statement shall indicate each disputed item and the
amount and the basis for the Seller's disagreement therewith and, to the
extent it has received from Purchaser the necessary related information,
giving reasonable detail in support thereof, and which statement may further
indicate any disputed items with respect to which Seller has not received from
Purchaser such necessary related information requested by Seller (an "
_Objections Statement_ "). The Objections Statement shall only include
disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on the Cash Amount,
Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital Amount not
being calculated in accordance with this Agreement. If an Objections Statement
is not delivered to Purchaser within sixty (60) days after delivery of the
Preliminary Statement to Seller, the Preliminary Statement shall be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
objections in the Objections Statement, but if and to the extent they do not
reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement, Seller and Purchaser shall submit such dispute to KPMG
LLP, and if such firm is no longer independent, unwilling or unable to accept
such engagement, BDO USA, LLP, and if such firm is no longer independent,
unwilling or unable to accept such engagement another independent accounting
firm of national reputation with significant experience related to purchase
price adjustments that is mutually selected by Purchaser and Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Purchaser and Seller cannot agree to such an
accounting firm within forty-five (45) days following the delivery of an
Objections Statement, then within fifteen (15) days each of Purchaser and
Seller shall designate such an independent accounting firm and the two
independent accounting firms selected by each shall within fifteen (15) days
select a third independent accounting firm of national reputation with
significant experience related to purchase price adjustments to serve (any
such firm, the " _Valuation Firm_ "). Any further submissions to the Valuation
Firm must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Valuation
Firm shall act as an expert and not as arbitrator, shall only consider the
disputed matters that were properly included in the Objections Statement and
shall make a final determination of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount,
Transaction Expenses, Net Working Capital Amount and the resulting Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration calculated with reference to such amounts
(solely to the extent such amounts are in dispute), in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement. The Valuation Firm may
not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value
assigned by Purchaser in the Preliminary Statement, on the one hand, or Seller
in the Objections Statement, on the other hand, or less than the smallest
value for such item assigned by Purchaser in the Preliminary Statement, on the
one hand, or Seller in the Objections Statement, on the other hand. The
parties shall cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term of its
engagement. The Valuation Firm shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after
submission of any dispute to the Valuation Firm, a written report setting
forth the resolution of such dispute determined in accordance with the terms
herein. Without limiting the rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons in
_Article IX_ , the determination of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount,
Transaction Expenses, Net Working Capital Amount and the resulting Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration calculated with reference thereto, in each
case in the manner contemplated by this _Section_ _ _ _2.2_ , shall become
final and binding on the parties on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its
final resolution in writing to the parties, absent a showing of manifest
error, and an order may be entered in respect thereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction, subject to _Section_ _ _ _11.8_. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Valuation Firm shall be borne by the parties in proportion to
the relative amount by which each party's determination has been modified. For
example, if Seller challenges the calculation of the Net Working Capital
Amount by an amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), but the
Valuation Firm determines that Seller has a valid claim for only Forty
Thousand Dollars ($40,000), then Purchaser shall bear forty percent (40%) of
the fees and expenses of the Valuation Firm and Seller shall bear the other
sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 2.3 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_**.

  



  

(a) If the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration is greater than or equal
to the Closing Aggregate Consideration, (i) Purchaser shall promptly (but in
any event within three (3) Business Days of the determination of the Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration) pay to Seller the amount of such excess, if
any, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated
in writing by Seller to Purchaser; and (ii) Seller and Purchaser shall
promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days of the determination
of the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration) jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to release to Seller the funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in accordance with
the wire transfer instructions designated in writing by Seller to the Escrow
Agent. If the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration is less than the Closing
Aggregate Consideration (the absolute value of such difference, the "
_Shortfall Amount_ "), (x) Seller and Purchaser shall promptly (but in any
event within three (3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Closing
Aggregate Consideration) jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Purchaser
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount the Shortfall Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in
writing by Purchaser to the Escrow Agent; _provided_ that to the extent the
Shortfall Amount is (A) less than the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount
and any balance in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account will remain
after such payment to Purchaser from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account, Seller and Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within three
(3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Closing Aggregate
Consideration and simultaneously with the instruction in clause (x)) jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller the amount remaining in the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, to the account or accounts
designated in writing by the Seller to the Escrow Agent; and (B) greater than
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, then Seller shall promptly (but
in any event within three (3) Business Days of the determination of the Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration) pay to Purchaser the difference between the
Shortfall Amount and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing
by Purchaser to Seller.

  



  

(b) The funds available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account
may be distributed to Purchaser and/or Seller solely and exclusively in
accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.3(a)_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement
applicable to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and shall not be
available for any other payment to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. All
title and all rights to all remaining funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Account shall automatically transfer to the Seller (i) immediately
after the payments made to Purchaser under _Section_ _ _ _2.3(a)_ , if the
Final Closing Aggregate Consideration is less than the Closing Aggregate
Consideration, or (ii) immediately upon the final determination of the Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration, if the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration
is greater than or equal to the Closing Aggregate Consideration, in each case
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(c) The parties agree that any amount paid under this _Section_ _ _ _2.3_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration
for Tax purposes and, subject to the outcome of a Tax Contest and the
provisions of _Section_ _ _ _10.5_ and _Section_ _ _ _10.7_ , agree not to
take any position inconsistent with such treatment on any Tax Return.

attachment fees (including any penalties, charges or other fees charged
pursuant to the pole attachment agreement) relating to the System have been
duly paid when due and payable, except where the failure to make such payment
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the operation of such System.

  



  

(e) Seller has no Knowledge that the Business or any Group Company is
subject to any agreement to settle or compromise any action pending or
threatened against it by any Governmental Authority which has involved or will
involve any obligation other than the payment of money or for which the

 **Section 4.14 Insurance**. _Section_ _ 4.14_ of the Disclosure Letter
lists each material insurance policy maintained by the Group Companies or, to
the extent related to the Business, the Seller Group (the " _Insurance
Policies_ "), and each such Insurance Policy is in full force and effect in
all material respects. True and complete copies of the Insurance Policies have
been made available to Purchaser, except for such policies which are in the
process of renewal, in which case any executed binder (and attached draft
policy) for such policies have been made available to Purchaser, in each case,
in all material respects. None of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including
the Group Companies) (i) is in material default with respect to its
obligations under any Insurance Policy or (ii) has received any material
refusal of coverage, any notice of cancellation or termination or any other
written notice that any Insurance Policy is no longer in full force or effect
in any material respect or will not be renewed or that the issuer of such
Insurance Policy is not willing or able to perform its obligations thereunder
in any material respect. There are no material claims by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Group Companies) pending under any Insurance
Policies as to which coverage has been denied by the underwriters thereof. The

under all Company Permits and Material Contracts to which any Group Company is
a party or by which any of them, the Business or their respective properties
or assets are bound.

  



  

 **Section 4.15 _Affiliate Transactions_**. No officer, director,
manager or Affiliate of a Group Company (other than another Group Company) or,

or related to the Business (other than arising under or in connection with
employment related Contracts, Company Plans and confidentiality Contracts or
other Contracts incident to such Person's employment with a Group Company) or
has any ownership of any material property used in or necessary for the
conduct of the Business.

  



  

 **Section 4.16 _Accounts Receivable_**. All of the accounts receivable
included in the Net Working Capital Amount arose out of bona fide transactions
occurring in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or
valid claims as to which full performance has been rendered by a Group
Company. No such account receivable arose from a sale made to a customer of
the Business involving any illegal activity (including kickbacks, bribes or
similar payments or price fixing or similar activities). As of the Closing,
any loans or advances made pursuant to clause (2) of _Section 6.1(a)(vii)_
have been repaid or otherwise removed from the Group Companies' accounts
receivables.

has elected "must-carry" or retransmission consent status with respect to the
relevant System(s) pursuant to the Communications Laws. Each television
station carried by the Systems (not limited to television stations located
within the Systems' local television markets) as of the date hereof is carried
in all material respects pursuant to a valid retransmission consent agreement,
"must-carry" election or other programming agreement between a Group Company
and each broadcaster. Other than with respect to routine blackout requests
submitted pursuant to FCC regulations, no material written notices or demands
have been received from the FCC, from any television station or from any other
Person or Governmental Authority (i) challenging the right of any System to
carry any television broadcast station or deliver the same or (ii) claiming
that any System failed to carry a television broadcast station required to be
carried pursuant to the Communications Laws or has failed to carry a
television broadcast station on a channel designated by such station
consistent with the requirements of the Communications Laws (x) within the
last two (2) years or (y) which the Person making such notice or demand has
not acknowledged in writing to have been resolved.

  



  

 **Section 4.18 _Takeover Statutes_**. No anti-takeover or similar
statute or regulation (such as Section 351.459 of the Missouri Revised
Statutes) is applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions.

material respects, as of the dates set forth in such Schedule, the following
approximate information with respect to the Systems, on a System-by-System
basis: (i) coax miles of the System, (ii) fiber miles of the System and (iii)

 **Section 4.20 _Franchise Renewal Rights_**. The Group Companies (i)
either (A) have, in all material respects, timely filed valid requests for
renewal under Section 626 of the Communications Act with the proper
Governmental Authority, or (B) have received a replacement statewide Franchise
covering the applicable System(s), in each case with respect to all Franchises
that expired on or after January 1, 2016, and which a Group Company continued
to operate after such date, or that will expire within thirty (30) months
after the date hereof; and (ii) since January 1, 2016, have timely filed valid
requests for renewal in all material respects with the proper Governmental
Authority with respect to telecommunications franchises which expired on or
after January 1, 2016 and which a Group Company continued to operate after
such date to the extent such filings were required. Since January 1, 2016,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including any Group Company) has
received notice from any Person that any Franchise will not be renewed or that
the applicable Governmental Authority has challenged or raised any objection
to a request for renewal under Section 626 of the Communications Act by any
Group Company in any material respect. Since January 1, 2016, the Group
Companies have complied in all material respects with any and all inquiries
and demands by any and all Governmental Authorities made with respect to all
such requests for renewal.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 4.21 _Assets and Liabilities of the Group Companies_**. At
the Closing, the assets owned by the Group Companies or transferred, assigned
or conveyed to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Specified
Transactions will constitute all of the assets necessary to conduct the
Business immediately following the Closing in substantially the same manner as
presently conducted. No right or interest in any material property or asset
that is necessary for the operation of the Business as currently conducted is
presently, or will at the Closing be, owned or held by a member of the Seller
Group. At and immediately after the Closing, the liabilities and obligations
of the Group Companies shall consist solely of liabilities and obligations
that arise exclusively out of the operation of the Business or that constitute
Ad Insertion Business Liabilities, and do not include any liabilities or
obligations that (a) arise out of or are related to any Seller Business or the
Excluded Assets or (b) constitute Excluded Liabilities. There are no facts,
circumstances or conditions that would reasonably be expected to form the
basis for any claim, action, suit, proceeding, liability or obligation against
or affecting any Group Company arising out of or relating to the ownership,
operation or conduct of any Seller Business or any Excluded Assets.

  



  

 **Article V 
  
  _Representations and Warranties of Purchaser_**

  



  

Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller that:

  



  

 **Section 5.1 _Organization, Standing and Organizational Power of
Purchaser_**. Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of Delaware.

  



  

 **Section 5.2 _Authority; Noncontravention_**.

  



  

(a) Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of and performance by
Purchaser under this Agreement, and the consummation by Purchaser of the
Transactions, have been duly authorized and approved by all requisite
corporate action by Purchaser (including the board of directors of Purchaser),
and no other corporate action on the part of Purchaser is necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery of and performance by Purchaser under
this Agreement and the consummation by Purchaser of the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Seller, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No
vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Purchaser is necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser, nor
the consummation by Purchaser of the Transactions, nor compliance by Purchaser
with any of the terms or provisions hereof, shall (i) conflict with or violate
any provision of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Purchaser, in
each case as amended to the date of this Agreement, (ii) assuming that each of
the consents, authorizations and approvals referred to in _Section_ _ _ _5.3_
are received (and any condition precedent to any such consent, authorization
or approval has been satisfied) and each of the filings referred to in
_Section_ _ _ _5.3_ are made and any applicable waiting periods referred to
therein have expired, violate any Law applicable to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to any right
of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in any
material or increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements of any Person under, any Contract to which Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c) Purchaser, and to the extent applicable its Affiliates, are legally,
technically and financially qualified to acquire, own and operate the Systems.
To the Knowledge of Purchaser, as of the date hereof, there is no fact
relating to Purchaser or its Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to
cause any Governmental Authority to fail to grant in a timely fashion any
consent or approval necessary for consummation by Purchaser of the
Transactions. As of the date hereof, no waiver of any applicable Law is
necessary to be obtained for Purchaser, and to the extent applicable its
Affiliates, to obtain authority to hold, or control the holder of, as
applicable, any Company Permit set forth on _Section_ _ _ _4.6(b)_ of the
Disclosure Letter.

compliance with the other applicable requirements of, the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange, no material
consents or approvals of, or material filings, declarations or registrations
with, any Governmental Authority are necessary for the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation by Purchaser of the
Transactions, other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 **Section 5.4 _Brokers and Other Advisors_**. No broker, investment
banker, financial advisor, intermediary, finder or other Person is entitled to
any broker's, finder's or financial advisor's fee or other similar fee or
commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, directly or indirectly, in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

 **Section 5.5 _Sufficient Funds_**. At the Closing, Purchaser will have
available to it sufficient funds to consummate the Transactions, including
payment of the amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_. Purchaser expressly
acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser's ability to obtain financing is not a
condition to its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 5.6 _Legal Proceedings_**. There are no suits or proceedings
pending (except for proceedings affecting the cable or telecommunications
industry generally) or, to Purchaser's Knowledge, threatened in writing
against Purchaser, at law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental
Authority, which, if determined adversely to Purchaser, would prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay Purchaser's timely
performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.
Purchaser is not subject to any outstanding judgment, order or decree of any
Governmental Authority (other than judgments, orders or decrees affecting the
cable or telecommunications industry generally) that would prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay Purchaser's timely
performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

 **Section 5.7 _Investment Representation_**. Purchaser is acquiring the
Shares for its own account with the present intention of holding such
securities for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution of such securities in violation of any
federal or state securities Laws. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act.
Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act, or any state or foreign securities Laws and that the Shares
may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or
otherwise disposed of unless such transfer, sale, assignment, pledge,
hypothecation or other disposition is registered under any applicable state or
foreign securities Laws or sold pursuant to an exemption from registration
under the Securities Act, and any applicable state or foreign securities Laws.

  



  

 **Section 5.8 _Solvency_**. Assuming (a) that the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all
material respects, (b) the compliance and performance by Seller and the Group
Companies of their respective obligations hereunder in all material respects,
(c) the satisfaction of the conditions to Purchaser's obligations to close in
_Article VII_ and (d) the solvency of the Group Companies immediately prior
to Closing, immediately after giving effect to the Transactions, Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies), on a consolidated basis (i)
will be able to pay their respective debts as they become due, (ii) will own
property that has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to
pay their respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of
all contingent liabilities) and (iii) will have adequate capital to carry on
their respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the Transactions by Purchaser
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors
of Purchaser or the Group Companies.

until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, it shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or

 **Section 6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_**.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Purchaser and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the
Transactions to be consummated as soon as practicable, (ii) make promptly any
required submissions and filings under applicable Antitrust Laws and
Communications Laws with respect to the Transactions, (iii) promptly furnish
information required in connection with such submissions and filing under such
Antitrust Laws and Communications Laws, (iv) keep the other party reasonably

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: Purchaser and
Seller agree to (A) make, or cause to be made, appropriate filings of
Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act and any other required
filings under any other Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as
soon as practicable (and, with respect to filings under the HSR Act, within
thirty (30) Business Days after the date hereof (unless Purchaser and Seller
otherwise agree to a different date)), (B) make, or cause to be made, the
filings and notifications required pursuant to the Communications Laws set

Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, (C) supply as soon as practicable any additional information and

necessary to obtain the FCC Approvals, PUC Approvals and LFA Approvals

termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws
(including any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable. The parties shall
cause the filings under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early
termination," and shall request the equivalent under any other Antitrust Laws.
For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Purchaser shall, following consultation with Seller and after giving
due consideration to its views and acting in good faith, direct and control
all aspects of the parties' efforts to obtain, and determine the strategy with
respect to obtaining, any clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under
Antitrust Laws or Communications Laws required by any Governmental Authority
for the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Each party hereto shall, in connection with the Antitrust Laws, the
Communications Laws, and the required filings thereunder: (i) promptly notify
the other party hereto of, and if in writing, furnish the other with copies of
(or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other of the contents of)
any material communication to such Person from a Governmental Authority and
permit the other to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good
faith any comments made by the other in relation to) any proposed written
communication to a Governmental Authority, (ii) keep the other reasonably
informed of any developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the
Transactions and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting or
discussions with a Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning the Transactions without giving the other
party prior notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate.
However, each of Purchaser and Seller may designate any non-public information
provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to "Outside Counsel" only
and any such information shall not be shared with employees, officers,
managers or directors or their equivalents of the other party without approval
of the party providing the non-public information.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries be required to commit to or effect, or Seller or any of its
Affiliates be permitted (without the prior written consent of Purchaser) to
commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or
otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of
assets or businesses of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any Group
Company, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying or waiving existing
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements
of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any Group Company, (iii) creating
any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or the Group Companies or (iv)
any other action, including agreeing to future behavioral remedies, requested
by a Governmental Authority in order to achieve clearance under any Antitrust
Law.

  



  

(e) Seller shall not, and shall cause the Group Companies not to, agree,
without Purchaser's prior written consent to any material adverse change to
the terms of any Company Permit or Contract as a condition to obtaining any
Other Regulatory Approval. If in connection with obtaining any such Other
Regulatory Approval, a Governmental Authority or other third party seeks to
impose any material adverse condition or material adverse change to any
Company Permit or Contract to which such consent or approval relates that
would be applicable to Purchaser or a Group Company as a requirement for
granting such consent or approval, Seller will, and will cause the applicable
Group Company to, promptly notify Purchaser of such fact and Seller and the
Group Companies shall not agree to such condition or change unless Purchaser
shall consent to such condition or change in writing.

  



  

   

  



  

(f) Seller and Purchaser shall each, with the reasonable cooperation of
the other, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consents with respect
to the consummation of the Transactions in respect of the Contracts set forth
on _Section 6.4(f)_ of the Disclosure Letter and all other third-party
consents reasonably requested by Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) days
of the date hereof which are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions as soon as practicable. For purposes of this _Section_ _6.4(f)_ ,
"commercially reasonable efforts" in connection with such consents will not,
among other things, be deemed to require the Seller or Purchaser to undertake
extraordinary measures, including the waiver of any condition to Closing in
its favor, the initiation or prosecution of any legal proceedings or the
expenditure of payment of funds in excess of normal and usual administrative
and processing fees, if any, or the giving of any other consideration or any
adjustment to the Closing Aggregate Consideration with respect to seeking or
obtaining any such consents.

  



  

(g) Seller shall cause the Group Companies to (i) timely file valid
requests for renewal under Section 626 of the Communications Act with the
proper Governmental Authority with respect to all Franchises that will expire
within thirty (30) months of the Closing Date, except with respect to
Franchises for which the applicable Group Company receives a replacement
statewide Franchise covering the applicable System(s), and (ii) timely file
valid requests for renewal with the proper Governmental Authority, to the
extent required, with respect to all other telecommunications franchises that
will expire within six (6) months of the Closing Date. Seller shall cause the
Group Companies to use reasonable best efforts to obtain a renewal, extension
or replacement of any Franchise for which a valid notice of renewal pursuant
to the formal renewal procedures established by Section 626 of the
Communications Act has not been timely delivered to the appropriate
Governmental Authority after January 1, 2016 and with respect to which no
written confirmation has been received after January 1, 2016 from such
Governmental Authority that the procedures established by Section 626
nonetheless will be applicable with respect to the renewal or extension of
such Franchise; _provided_ that Seller and the Group Companies shall not agree
to any material adverse condition or material adverse change to such Franchise
unless Purchaser shall, in its reasonably exercised discretion, consent to
such condition or change in writing. To the extent Purchaser has not consented
to any such condition or change that is immaterial or commercially reasonable,
any such Franchise extension or Franchise renewal shall be deemed obtained and
received for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_**. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably agreed upon by
Purchaser and Seller. Following such initial press release, Purchaser and
Seller shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or the
listing rules of any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (and then only after as much advance notice and consultation
as is reasonably feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not preclude (a) communications or disclosures necessary to implement the
provisions of this Agreement or, following a Closing, in connection with court
filings made in any litigation related to the parties or this Agreement or (b)
press releases and other communications or disclosures that in the good faith
judgment of the applicable party are consistent with prior press releases
issued or other public communications or disclosures made in compliance with
this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 6.6 _Access to Information; Contact with Employees, Customers
and Suppliers; Confidentiality_**. ******** Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, from the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing or the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, Seller shall, and shall cause each Group Company

underwriters in respect of the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy)

Contracts and records of the Group Companies and, to the extent related to the
Business, the members of the Seller Group, and Seller shall, and shall cause
each Group Company to, furnish promptly to Purchaser such information
concerning the Business and the Group Companies' properties as Purchaser may
reasonably request; _provided_ that Purchaser and its Representatives shall
conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of Seller or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Seller and the Group Companies shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information (i) if Seller determines, in its reasonable
judgment after consultation with counsel, that doing so would (A) violate
applicable Law, (B) jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege
or (C) violate an obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party under
any Contract to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and, in the
case of this clause (C), would reasonably be expected to result in material
adverse consequences to Seller or its applicable Subsidiary or expose such
party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive, competitive or
personal information or (ii) that constitute non-financial trade secrets (
_provided_ that, in each case, the parties shall reasonably cooperate in
seeking an alternative means whereby Purchaser is provided access to such
information or the contents or a reasonable redacted summary thereof). All
requests by Purchaser for access pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall be
submitted or directed exclusively to John Colbert via the email address
[Redacted]. The information provided shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall not, and Purchaser shall cause its Representatives
not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the Transactions
(including for the purpose of coordinating integration activities and
transition planning with the Business Employees).

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and its Representatives may only
contact and communicate with the employees, customers, service providers and
suppliers of Seller and its Subsidiaries related to the Transactions (i)
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _6.6(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter, or (ii) after
prior consultation with and approval of Seller, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Copies of confidentiality agreements entered into by Seller or any of
its Affiliates with any Person relating to the Business, the Group Companies
or the Ad Insertion Business shall be provided by Seller to Purchaser on or
promptly after the Closing Date. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, assign to Purchaser or the Group Companies, as applicable, at the Closing
all of their rights under such agreements to confidential treatment and non-
use of information related to the Business or the Group Companies or with
respect to solicitation and hiring of Business Employees. In the event Seller
is unable to assign any such rights under any such agreements, from and after
the Closing, at the request of Purchaser, Seller shall enforce such rights on
behalf of Purchaser and the Group Companies.

  



  

 **Section 6.7 _Access to Books and Records_**. From and after the
Closing, for a period of seven (7) years, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Group Companies to, provide Seller and its authorized Representatives with
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to (i) the
books and records (for the purpose of examining and copying) of the Group
Companies with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing
Date and (ii) employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Group
Companies) for purposes of better understanding such books and records in each
case only (A) to the extent necessary for Seller to comply with applicable
Law, comply with a request, investigation, inquiry or examination from any
regulatory authority or comply with or perform obligations under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or (B) in connection with a dispute, action,
suit, proceeding, DandO Claim or litigation brought by a third party against
Seller, an Indemnitee or one of its Affiliates; _provided_ that Seller and its
authorized Representatives shall conduct any such activities in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of Purchaser,
the Group Companies or their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in connection with litigation to which Seller or any of its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand,
are adverse parties, Purchaser shall not be required to provide access to any
such books, records or employees. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by
Seller, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Group Companies to, for
a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Group Companies for
any period prior to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior
written notice to the Seller and offering to surrender to Seller such books
and records or any portion thereof that Purchaser or the Group Companies may
intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

  



  

 **Section 6.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_**.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group
Companies to (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each individual who is a
current or former manager, director and officer of any Group Company (each, an
" _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative) (each, a " _D andO Claim_"), whenever asserted,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission
relating to their position with a Group Company occurring or alleged to have
occurred before or at the Closing (including any DandO Claim relating in whole
or in part to this Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Group
Companies to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of liability,
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided in (A)
the Group Company Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof and (B) any indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee, in each case
as in effect on the date hereof (correct and complete copies of which shall
have been made available to Purchaser), which shall in each case survive the
Transactions and continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall ensure that each Group Company fulfills its obligations to the
applicable Indemnitees pursuant to the terms of the Group Company Charter
Documents, as in effect on the date hereof.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group
Companies to, pay and advance to each Indemnitee any expenses (including fees
and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any DandO Claim relating to
any acts or omissions covered under this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ or the
enforcement of an Indemnitee's rights under this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ as and
when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_
that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such expenses (but only to the extent required by applicable Law, the Group
Company Charter Documents or applicable indemnification agreements as in
effect prior to the date hereof (correct and complete copies of which shall
have been made available to Purchaser)).

  



  

(c) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with the Indemnitees in
the defense of any DandO Claim and shall provide access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery,
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested by an
Indemnitee in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not (and Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies not to)
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any DandO Claim, unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all of the
Indemnitees covered by the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation. Nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _6.8(c)_ shall relieve Purchaser
or any Group Company of its obligations set forth in _Section_ _ _ _6.8_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Purchaser under this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnitee to whom this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ applies unless (A) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected
Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees, heirs and Representatives to whom this _Section_
_ _ _6.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ _ _
_6.8_ ).

  



  

(e) In the event that Purchaser, a Group Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser
and the applicable Group Company shall assume all of the obligations thereof
set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _6.8_.

  



  

   

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to members', managers', directors'
and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in
existence with respect to any Group Company or its managers, directors or
officers.

  



  

 **Section 6.9 _No Control of Other Party 's Business_**. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Business or any Group Company
prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over the Business and the Group Companies.

  



  

 **Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_**.

  



  

(a) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser not later than ten (10) days prior
to the Closing Date an updated version of the Business Employee Schedule that
is true and complete in all material respects as of fifteen (15) days prior to
the Closing.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall, or shall cause each Group Company or Purchaser's
other Affiliates to, for a period of at least six (6) months following the
Closing (or any such shorter period of employment), provide to each Business
Employee who is employed by any Group Company as of immediately prior to the
Closing (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") at least the same base salary that
was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(c) For eligibility and vesting purposes (other than vesting of future
equity awards) and for purposes of determining severance amounts and future
vacation accruals under the compensation and employee benefit plans, policies
or arrangements of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
any Group Company), each Continuing Employee shall receive credit for his or
her service with Seller and its Affiliates (including any Group Company) prior
to the Closing Date as if such service were with Purchaser or its Affiliates
to the same extent that such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
Closing, to credit for his or her service under any similar or comparable
Company Plans (except to the extent this credit would result in a duplication
of benefits in respect of the same period of service). In addition, for any
medical, dental, health or other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates (each, a " _Successor Plan_ ") other
than the plan or plans in which Continuing Employees participated immediately
prior to the Closing (each, a " _Prior Plan_ "), Purchaser shall, or shall
cause each Group Company or Purchaser's other Affiliates to, (i) cause each
Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate immediately, without any
waiting time, in any and all Successor Plans, (ii) cause the Successor Plans
to not include any restrictions, limitations or exclusionary provisions with
respect to pre-existing conditions, exclusions or any actively-at-work
requirements relating to such Continuing Employee and his or her dependents
(except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements were applicable to
Continuing Employees (including their respective dependents and beneficiaries,
if any) under any similar Prior Plan at the time of commencement of
participation in such Successor Plan) and (iii) cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Prior Plan ending on the date of such
Continuing Employee's commencement of participation in the Successor Plan to
be taken into account under the Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if these amounts had been paid in accordance with the Successor
Plan.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall have taken such
actions as may be necessary to fully vest all account balances of Continuing
Employees (and their beneficiaries) who participated in all Company Plans
providing for deferral of compensation pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code
or Roth 401(k) contributions (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and amend the
Company 401(k) Plan as necessary to permit each Continuing Employee to make
rollover contributions of the Continuing Employee's account balance including
any promissory notes evidencing any outstanding plan loans. On and after the
Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to
distribute the account balances of Continuing Employees (and their
beneficiaries) who participated in a Company 401(k) Plan and facilitate the
rollover of the account balances (including any promissory notes evidencing
any outstanding plan loans, as applicable), of the Continuing Employees (and
their beneficiaries), distributed under the Company 401(k) Plan in connection
with the Transaction, as of the Closing Date in accordance with the
requirements of applicable Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable following the Closing and in any event
within ninety (90) days following the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) permit each
Continuing Employee who was a participant in or eligible to participate in a
Company 401(k) Plan prior to the Closing to participate in a tax-qualified
defined contribution retirement plan established or designated by Purchaser
(the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") and (ii) take any and all actions as may be
required (including the amendment of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, as necessary)
to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of the
Continuing Employee's account balance (including any promissory notes
evidencing any outstanding plan loans, as applicable), to the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan (subject to the requirements of applicable law); provided such Continuing
Employee elects to rollover his or her entire account balance under the
Company 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.

  



  

(e) Immediately prior to or on the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, pay all unused vacation days of Continuing Employees
to such employees, and Purchaser shall have no liability with respect to
unused paid vacation days accrued prior to the Closing Date. After the
Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause each Group Company or Purchaser's
other Affiliates to allow each of the Continuing Employees to earn vacation
days on the same terms and conditions as the Continuing Employees earned
vacation days on the applicable Seller policies in place immediately prior to
the Closing Date, through December 31, 2019. On and after January 1, 2020, all
Continuing Employees who remain employed with Purchaser, or with a Group
Company or one of Purchaser's Affiliates, shall earn and accrue vacation and
sick leave days in accordance with the applicable policies in place by
Purchaser on such date, in its sole discretion. Between the Closing Date and
December 31, 2019, Purchaser agrees to consider reasonable requests by
Continuing Employees for use of unpaid vacation days, particularly during the
final two weeks of December 2019. To the extent required by the applicable
Seller policies in place immediately prior to Closing or Law, on the Closing
Date, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay any unused sick
leave days of Continuing Employees to such employees, and Purchaser shall have
no liability with respect to sick leave days accrued prior to the Closing
Date. Beginning on the Closing Date, Continuing Employees shall accrue sick
leave days in accordance with the applicable policies in place by Purchaser on
such date.

Companies and on inactive status, until or unless such Inactive Business
Employee is able to return to work. Purchaser shall have no liability, and
Seller shall retain all liability for any claims, including workers'

and Purchaser and shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and Purchaser
based upon the relative periods of time that the workers' compensation claim
transpired preceding and following the Closing.

shall structure the timing of the Transaction Bonus payments in the manner set
forth on _Section 4.8(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter and shall pay any post-
Closing payments directly to the recipients and Purchaser shall not have any
obligation to assume any responsibility for the payment of the Transaction

following the Closing and (ii) to any former employee of Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any Group Company (and any dependent of such employee) who is

_further_ , __ that in no event shall Seller or the Group Companies or their
respective Representatives **** be required in connection with the cooperation
contemplated by this _Section_ _6.12(_ _a_ _)_ to bear any cost or expense,
pay any fee, enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability
in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing. Further, such
assistance shall not include any actions that Seller reasonably believes could
reasonably be expected to (x) result in a violation of any confidentiality
arrangement or material agreement (not entered into in contemplation thereof)
or the loss of any legal or other applicable privilege or (y) cause the Seller
or any of the Group Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective employees, directors, officers or managers to incur any
actual or potential liability in connection with the arranging, marketing or
syndication of the Debt Financing or such assistance (except, in the case of
the Group Companies, any such liability after the Closing). Nothing in this
agreement shall require any cooperation to the extent that it would require
the Seller or any of the Group Companies or any of their respective employees,

Financing, including the cooperation contemplated by this _Section_ _6.12(_
_a_ _)_ , and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and the Group
Companies and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
Damages suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing and any information used in connection therewith, in
each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises from
intentional fraud with respect to any of the representations and warranties of
Seller in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Seller hereby consents to the use of its and the Group Companies'
logos solely in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos
are used solely in a manner that does not, and is not intended or reasonably
likely to, harm or disparage Seller's or the Group Companies' reputation or
goodwill and will comply with Seller's or the Group Companies' usage
requirements to the extent made available to Purchaser prior to the date of
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt
Financing is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Debt Financing, subject to
fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article_ _ _ _VII_.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the
obligations of Seller and the Group Companies set forth in _Section_ _6.12(_

respect to the Debt Financing and such obligations shall not be used after the
Closing as a basis for any claim of any breach by the Seller or the Group
Companies.

  



  

 **Section 6.13 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts and Intercompany
Balances_**. Except as set forth on _Section 6.13_ of the Disclosure Letter,
Seller shall cause each Contract between any of the Group Companies, on the
one hand, and any member of the Seller Group, on the other hand, to be
terminated as of the Closing. Except as set forth on _Section_ _ 6.13_ of the
Disclosure Letter, with effect from the Closing, no Group Company shall have
any obligation or liability in respect of any such terminated Contract or any
loans, notes, advances, receivables and payables between any member of the
Seller Group, on the one hand, and any Group Company, on the other hand,
except pursuant to _Section_ _ 1.3(d)_.

  



  

 **Section 6.14 _Specified Transactions_**.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall effect the Specified
Transactions and take, or cause to be taken, all other actions that are
necessary or appropriate such that, as of the Closing, (i) the assets owned or
held by the Group Companies or transferred, assigned or conveyed to Purchaser
or its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Specified Transactions consist of all
assets necessary to conduct the Business immediately following the Closing in
substantially the same manner as presently conducted and (ii) the liabilities
and obligations of the Group Companies consist solely of liabilities and
obligations that arise exclusively out of the operation of the Business or
that constitute Ad Insertion Business Liabilities, and do not include any
liabilities or obligations that (x) arise out of or are related to any Seller
Business or the Excluded Assets or (y) constitute Excluded Liabilities. In
furtherance, and not in limitation of the foregoing, at or prior to the
Closing, Seller shall take, or cause to be taken, the actions set forth on
_Section 6.14(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, but subject to the provisions of _Section 6.14(a)_ of the
Disclosure Letter, in connection with the consummation of the Specified
Transactions: (i) to the extent any consents are required from any third
parties in connection with the transfer, assignment or conveyance of any
Contract or any personal easements that do not otherwise run with the Owned
Real Property or the Leased Real Property, Seller shall only be required to
use commercially reasonable efforts (as defined in _Section 6.4(f)_ ) to
obtain such consents, it being understood that the failure to obtain any such
consent, in and of itself, shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ to be satisfied or to serve as the basis
for a claim for indemnification under _Article IX_ ); (ii) with respect to the
Ad Insertion Business Assets, Seller shall not be required to exert any
efforts to obtain any consent required from any third party for the transfer,
assignment and conveyance of any such assets and the failure to obtain any
such consent shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute the failure
of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ to be satisfied or serve as the
basis of a claim for indemnification under _Article IX_ ; and (iii) Seller
shall not transfer, assign or convey any Contracts or other assets
specifically set forth on _Section 6.14(b)(i_ _ii_ _)_ of the Disclosure
Letter.

  



  

(c) If Seller is unable to obtain any third party consent required for the
transfer, assignment or conveyance to a Group Company or Purchaser or a
Subsidiary of Purchaser, as the case may be, of any Contract specified on
_Section 6.14(_ _c_ _)_ of the Disclosure Letter (the " _Specified Contracts_
") prior to the date that is sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement
or such later date as may be consented to by Purchaser, Seller shall, as
promptly as practicable thereafter, cause a Group Company to procure a
replacement Contract with a new vendor providing for, effective upon the
Closing, substantially the same functionality, benefits and burdens as the
Specified Contract (which Contract shall not contain any "change of control",
"anti-assignment" or similar provision that would cause the consummation of
the Specified Transactions or the Transactions to conflict with, or result in
a breach or violation of, or default (with or without notice or the lapse of
time, or both) under, such Contract) (a " _Replacement Contract_ ");
_provided, however_ , if the fees and expenses payable over twelve (12) months
by a Group Company under a Replacement Contract exceed the fees and expenses
paid by Seller under the applicable Specified Contract during the twelve (12)
months prior to Closing, then an amount equal to two (2) times such excess
(the " _Replacement Fee_ ") shall be treated as a Transaction Expense, except
to the extent the amount of such Replacement Fee is not determinable prior to
the Closing, in which case Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for such
Replacement Fee promptly after such amount is determined. If Seller causes a
Group Company to procure a Replacement Contract in respect of any Specified
Contract pursuant to this _Section 6.14(c)_ , such Specified Contract shall
not be transferred, assigned or conveyed to a Group Company or Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Specified Transactions, and such
Specified Contract shall constitute an Excluded Asset.

  



  

(d) If Seller is unable to obtain prior to the Closing any third party
consent required for the transfer, assignment or conveyance to a Group Company
or Purchaser or a Subsidiary of Purchaser, as the case may be, of any Contract
(other than any Specified Contract) pursuant to the Specified Transactions,
until the earlier of such consent having been obtained and the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall continue to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent and (ii) the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other
in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to Purchaser all
economic benefits and burdens of any such Contract. During such time period,
Seller and any applicable member of the Seller Group shall comply with all
applicable covenants and obligations with respect to such Contract, including
the payment of any costs or expenses in connection therewith, which shall be
performed by Seller or the applicable member of the Seller Group for
Purchaser's account and Purchaser shall promptly (but in no event later than
thirty (30) days following receipt of an invoice from Seller) reimburse Seller
for any such out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments made by Seller or the
applicable member of the Seller Group in respect of such Contract. If and when
any such consent is obtained, Seller shall promptly assign, transfer and
convey to Purchaser, or a Group Company designated by Purchaser, as the case
may be, the applicable Contract at no additional cost.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) At the Closing, Fidelity Telephone Company shall enter into a lease
agreement in form and substance acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (the "

as and when received by them, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements,
mail, packages or other property that they may receive which properly belong
to the other parties, and shall account to the other parties for all receipts
in respect of any such property. The parties acknowledge and agree there is no
right of offset regarding any such payments and a party may not withhold funds
received from third parties for the account of the other party in the event
there is a dispute regarding any other issue under any this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Documents.

  



  

 **Section 6.16 _Use of Trademarks_**. At the Closing, Seller shall
transfer, assign and convey to Purchaser or the Group Companies all right,
title and interest in, to and under all the Trademarks owned by the Seller
Group that are used in the Business as of the Closing Date, including
"Fidelity Communications" and "FidelityTV" (collectively, the " _Transferred
Trademarks_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller Group will retain the
right to use the names "Fidelity Communications Co.", "Fidelity Wireless,
Inc." and "Fidelity Broadcasting, Inc."

  



  

 **Section 6.17 _280G Cooperation_**. In the event Seller determines
that any payments or benefits (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) a Disqualified Individual may become entitled to receive could be
subject to the excise tax pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, Seller shall
solicit a shareholder vote intended to satisfy the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5) of the Code, such that no portion of the payments could constitute
a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code,
and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in providing information on any
Purchaser payments that, as of the date of the relevant vote, Purchaser has
determined to make and that may also be considered "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code on account of the Transactions.

  



  

 **Section 6.18 _Non-Solicit and No-Hire of Employees; Non-
Competition_**.

  



  

(a) As a necessary measure to ensure that Purchaser realizes the goodwill
and associated benefits of the Transactions, for a period of two (2) years

or enter into any business arrangement with or otherwise partner with any
third party with respect to, any business that competes with the business of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) in the states
of Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the activities set forth on _Section 6.1_ _8_ _(b)_ of the Disclosure
Letter shall not constitute a breach of this _Section 6.1_ _8_ _(b)_.

  



  

(c) Seller agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Control
Affiliates, that (i) Purchaser is relying to its detriment on the covenants
set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _6.18_ in connection with entering into this
Agreement and consummating the Transactions, (ii) the enforcement of any
covenants set forth in this _Section_ _ 6.18_ against Seller or its
Affiliates would not impose any undue burden upon Seller or its Affiliates and
(iii) none of the covenants set forth in this _Section_ _ 6.18_ are
unreasonable as to duration or scope.

  



  

 **Section 6.19 _Confidentiality_**. From and after the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, keep confidential and not disclose
to any other Person, or use for their own benefit or the benefit of any other
Person, any confidential and non-public information regarding Purchaser, any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) or the Business or the Ad
Insertion Business which Seller or its Affiliates possess as a result of
Seller's historical relationship with the Group Companies (including as a
stockholder or other equityholder of any Company) or obtain pursuant to
Seller's access and information rights under this Agreement. The obligations
under this _Section 6.19_ shall not apply to information which (a) is or
becomes generally available to the public without breach of Seller's or its
Affiliates' obligations under this _Section 6.19_ or (b) is required to be
disclosed by applicable Law; _provided_ that in the case of clause (b), Seller

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be filed an election
on IRS Form 8832 (and any applicable, comparable election for state or local

to enter into the FidelityLink Acquisition Agreement within sixty (60) days of
the date of this Agreement, to consummate the FidelityLink Acquisition at or
prior to the Closing, or elect to treat FidelityLink as a Group Company shall
not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute the failure of any condition

performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing.

Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section

efforts to consummate the Transactions or due to the failure of such party to

 **Article VIII 
  
  _Termination_**

  



  

 **Section 8.1 _Termination_**. This Agreement may be terminated and the

(b) by either of Seller or Purchaser:

  



  

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before January 6,
2020 (such date being the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _8.1(b)(i)_ shall not
be available to a party if the failure of the Closing to have been consummated
on or before the Outside Date was primarily due to the failure of such party
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

  



  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section_ _ _
_7.1(c)_ shall be in effect and such Restraint shall have become final and
non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section _ _8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a
party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this

under _Section_ _ _ _6.4_ ;

  



  

(c) by Purchaser if Seller or any of the Group Companies shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section_ _ _ _7.2(a)_ or _Section_ _ _ _7.2(b)_ , respectively, and (B)
cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not
have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice
from Purchaser stating Purchaser's intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _8.1(c)_ and the basis for such termination;
_provided_ that Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section _ _8.1(c)_ if it is then in breach of or has failed
to perform its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
hereunder, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section _ _7.3(a)_ or _Section _ _7.3(b)_ and
has not been cured; or

  



  

(d) by Seller if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section _ _7.3(a)_ or _Section _
_7.3(b)_ , respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Purchaser by the Outside
Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty
(30) days following receipt of written notice from Seller stating Seller's
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section _ _8.1(d)_
and the basis for such termination; _provided_ that Seller shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section _ _8.1(d)_ if it
is then in breach of or has failed to perform its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements hereunder, which breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section _
_7.2(a)_ or _Section _ _7.2(b)_ and has not been cured; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the failure to deliver the Closing Aggregate Consideration as
required hereunder shall not be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise

 **Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_**. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void (other than the indemnification and
reimbursement provisions in _Section 6.12(a)_ , this _Section 8.2_, and
_Article XI_ (other than _Section 11.9_ except to the extent it relates to
any provisions that are stated to survive termination of this Agreement), all
of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no
liability on the part of Purchaser or Seller or their respective managers,
directors, employees, officers or Affiliates hereunder; _provided_ , _however_
, that no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages
arising out of intentional fraud with respect to any representations and
warranties made by it in this Agreement or any willful breach of a covenant of
this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser's willful
breach of the obligation to close the Transactions in circumstances in which
all of the closing conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_
have been satisfied or waived). For the avoidance of doubt, no party hereto
may bring a claim seeking monetary damages against the other party (other than
in the case of intentional fraud with respect to any representations and
warranties made by the other party in this Agreement or in the officer's
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(e)_ or _7.3(c)_ , as
applicable, or willful breach of a covenant of this Agreement) prior to the
Closing or termination of this Agreement in accordance with this _Article
VIII_. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  



  

 **Article IX 
  
  _Indemnification_**

  



  

 **Section 9.1 _Survival_**. Except for the representations and
warranties of Seller in _Section 3.4_ and _Section 4.2_ (the " _Fundamental
Representations_ "), which shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, the Seller Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement of Purchaser shall
terminate effective as of the Closing and shall not survive the Closing. The
covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement that are
required to be performed prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect until the date that is thirteen (13) months
after the Closing Date, and the covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement that are required to be performed after the
Closing shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms. The obligations of Seller to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons (x) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section
9.2(a)(ii)_ shall survive until and shall terminate when the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement terminates pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.1_, (y) pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_ shall survive until and shall terminate on the date that is
ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
and (z) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ shall survive and continue
indefinitely. The obligations of Purchaser to indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Persons pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ shall survive until and shall terminate
when the applicable covenant or agreement terminates pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 9.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligation of a party to indemnify the applicable Indemnified Persons in
respect of any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
any Tax in respect of which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement
will survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the
preceding sentence if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof or notice of
the Tax giving rise to such right of indemnification will have been given to
Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, prior to such time in accordance with
_Section 9.3_, _Section 10.4_ or _Section 10.5_, as applicable.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the date or
dates specified in the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy with
respect to the time periods, including the time periods within which to make
claims and/or regarding which any Purchaser Indemnified Persons may obtain
recoveries under such Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy, shall
govern such claims and/or recoveries under the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy, and shall not extend or otherwise change the survival
periods set forth in this _Section 9.1_.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 9.2 _Indemnification_**.

  



  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article _ _IX_ , from
and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (the " _Purchaser
Indemnified Persons_ ") against any and all losses, damages, costs, charges,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys', accountants' and other
professionals' fees, disbursements and expenses), settlement payments, awards,
judgments, Taxes, fines or obligations (collectively, " _Damages_ ") incurred
or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and arising out of or
resulting from:

  



  

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of
Seller in _Section_ _ _ _3.4_ or _Section _ _4.2_ as of the Closing Date
(with the same effect as though such representation and warranty is made on
and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent that such representation and
warranty speaks as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
date));

  



  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller or, prior to the
Closing, any Group Company, contained in this Agreement and required to be
performed on or prior to the Closing Date;

  



  

(iii) any Indemnified Taxes; and

  



  

(iv) the Seller Business, the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Employee
Liabilities.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article _ _IX_ , from
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (the " _Seller Indemnified
Persons_ ") against any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the Seller
Indemnified Persons and arising out of or resulting from:

  



  

(i) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) Purchaser's operation of the Business and Ad Insertion Business on
and after the Closing Date.

  



  

 **Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedures_**.

  



  

(a) Any Indemnified Person seeking indemnification or reimbursement
pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _IX_ shall promptly provide to Seller (if such
Person is a Purchaser Indemnified Person) or to Purchaser (if such Person is a
Seller Indemnified Person) (i) a written notice of any claims that it may have
pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _IX_ (a " _Claim Notice_ ") and (ii) in the
event that there be asserted against any Indemnified Person any written claim
or demand by a third party for which such Indemnified Person may be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _IX_ (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), a Claim Notice with respect thereto within fifteen (15) days
following such Indemnified Person's receipt of such claim (and no fewer than
ten (10) days prior to a scheduled appearance date in a litigated matter);
_provided_ , _however_ , __ that any failure by such Indemnified Person to
give such notice will not relieve any indemnification obligations hereunder
unless and only to the extent Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, is
prejudiced by such failure. Each Claim Notice shall contain the amount or a
good faith estimate of the potential Damages (the " _Damage Estimate_ ")
against which such Indemnified Person seeks indemnification, to the extent
then ascertainable, and a statement that such Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _IX_ with respect to such
potential Damages and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor. If the
applicable Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Person within
thirty (30) calendar days following its receipt of a Claim Notice (other than
a Third-Party Claim Notice) that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim or
lacks information to evaluate such claim, such claim shall be conclusively
deemed a liability for which the Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification under _Section_ _ _ _9.2_ and the amount of such claim shall
be paid to the Indemnified Person, on demand, solely with respect to Damages
actually suffered or incurred prior to delivery of the Claim Notice and
described in reasonable detail (including the amounts of such Damages) in the
Claim Notice (for the avoidance of doubt, disregarding any Damage Estimates or
unknown amounts of Damages in the Claim Notice).

  



  

(b) With respect to each Third-Party Claim that is the subject of a Claim
Notice, and except with respect to a Third-Party Claim governed by _Section_ _
_ _10.4_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ _ _
_9.3(c)_ , to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim, at its
own expense, with counsel approved by the applicable Indemnified Person (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) by notice to
such Indemnified Person; _provided_ that Seller shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim if an Insurer under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy is required to assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim pursuant to the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy (so long as Seller has consented to any provisions of or
amendments to such policy that relate to such assumption) (it being understood
that Seller has consented to the provisions of the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy as in effect on the date hereof); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim if the Third-Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other
equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnified Person except where such equitable relief or other relief is
immaterial and incidental to claims for monetary damages. The Indemnifying
Party may settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party
Claim that it has elected to assume the defense of but shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise or offer to
settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim on a basis that would result in or
would reasonably be expected to result in (A) the imposition of a consent
order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct
of the applicable Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (B) any non-
monetary condition or obligation being imposed on the applicable Indemnified
Person or any of its Affiliates, (C) any material adverse effect on the
business of the applicable Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (D)
any admission of fault or liability by any applicable Indemnified Person or
any of its Affiliates, (E) an obligation of the Indemnified Person to pay any
amount that is not fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party or (F) loss of
coverage under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy (so long as
Seller has consented to any provisions of or amendments to such policy that
relate to settlements).

  



  

   

  



  

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies such Indemnified
Person that it desires to defend against a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnified
Person shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any
such defense and employ separate counsel of its choosing. Such Indemnified
Person shall participate in any such defense at its own expense unless in the
reasonable opinion of outside counsel to such Indemnified Person, (i) a
conflict or potential conflict (other than by virtue of delivery of a Claim
Notice) exists or (ii) one or more defenses are available to such Indemnified
Person that are not available to Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, that, in
each case, would make such separate representation advisable, in which case
the reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements and expenses of such separate
representation shall be indemnifiable Damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to reimbursement for more than one
such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) in connection with any
Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected not to control
the defense of a Third-Party Claim or does not have a right to control the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability
with respect to a Third-Party Claim settled or compromised without the
Indemnifying Party's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to the foregoing, for so long as the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnified Person will have the right to undertake the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim, in which case the
reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnified Person for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the
Indemnified Person shall have failed to give notice of the claim as provided
above) may be indemnifiable Damages if provided for in this _Article _ _IX_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to
reimbursement for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local
counsel) in connection with any Third-Party Claim.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) Purchaser, Seller and the Indemnified Persons shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing access to each other's relevant business records and other documents
and employees. Purchaser, Seller and the Indemnified Persons shall keep each
other reasonably informed with respect to the status of such Third-Party Claim
as either may request from time to time.

  



  

(f) Any action to be taken under this _Article_ _ _ _IX_ by any
Indemnified Person may be taken by Purchaser on its behalf or Seller on its
behalf, as the case may be. Purchaser and Seller, as the case may be, shall
have the right to enforce this _Article_ _ _ _IX_ on behalf of any Indemnified
Person.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ _ _ _9.3_ shall not
apply to Tax Contests, which shall be governed by _Section _ _10.4_. Tax
disputes (other than Third-Party Claims that are not Tax Contests) shall be
subject to _Section_ _ _ _10.5_.

  



  

 **Section 9.4 _Final Resolution_**. A Claim Notice, any amounts claimed
therein and any other matters set forth therein shall be deemed to be "finally
resolved" for purposes of this _Article IX_ when (i) such Claim Notice,
amounts and matters have been resolved by a written agreement executed by
Purchaser and Seller or (ii) such Claim Notice, amounts and matters have been
resolved by a final, nonappealable order, decision or ruling of a court of
competent jurisdiction or arbitrator with respect to such matter in dispute,
or portion thereof.

  



  

 **Section 9.5 _Calculation of Damages_**.

  



  

(a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this _Article_ _IX_ shall be calculated net of any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Person under any insurance policies and any amounts recovered
pursuant to any indemnification right, claim, recovery, settlement,
reimbursement arrangement, contract or payment by or against a third party, in
each case relating to such Damages, net of the costs and expenses incurred in
seeking such collection; _provided_ that the amount deemed to be recovered
under insurance policies will also be net of the deductible for such policies
and any increase in the premium (and retro-premium adjustments) for such
policies to the extent arising out of or in connection with such Damages.
Subject to _Section_ _9.8_ , the Indemnified Persons shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery under any insurance policies (other than
the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy) covering any Damage to the
same extent as they would if such Damage were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any
Indemnified Persons with respect to any Damage for which any such Person has
been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery shall be made promptly to the Seller or Purchaser, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article_ _IX_ , the parties
agree that no amount shall be due under this _Article_ _IX_ to the extent that
it duplicates another amount already paid or accounted for under this
_Article_ _IX_ or in the calculation of the final Indebtedness Amount, final
Net Working Capital Amount, final Transaction Expenses.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article_ _IX_ , no
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this _Article_
_IX_ for any (i) consequential, incidental or special (including loss of
revenue, income or profits or a multiple thereof or similar valuation) damages
(in each case, to the extent not reasonably foreseeable) or (ii) punitive
damages (except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent
awarded to a third party by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection
with a Third-Party Claim). 

  



  

(c) The Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to the indemnification
provided for under this _Article IX_ even if any of them (i) had knowledge at
any time of the matter that is later the subject of a claim for indemnity or
(ii) waived any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ , _Section 7.2_
or _Section 7.3_ , as the case may be.

  



  

 **Section 9.6 _Mitigation_**. Each Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall take reasonable steps to mitigate such Person's Damages after
becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any Damages that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection
herewith. Each Purchaser and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each other Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person,
respectively, to comply with this _Section 9.6_.

  



  

 **Section 9.7 _Tax Treatment_**. The parties agree that any amount paid
under this _Article IX_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration for Tax purposes and, subject to the outcome
of a Tax Contest and the provisions of _Section 10.5_ and _Section 10.7_,
agree not to take any position inconsistent with such treatment on any Tax
Return.

  



  

 **Section 9.8 _Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy_**.

  



  

(a) Subject to the reimbursement obligations of Seller in the immediately
following sentence, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser
Indemnified Persons, hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except in the case
of intentional fraud, Purchaser shall have no recourse against Seller for any
and all Damages of any kind related to or arising under the Seller
Representations, except the Fundamental Representations and Seller shall have
no liability to any Purchaser Indemnified Person for any claims and/or Damages
of any kind related to or arising out of the Seller Representations, except
the Fundamental Representations. Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other
Purchaser Indemnified Persons, hereby further acknowledges and agrees that the
provisions of this _Section 9.8_ shall apply and shall remain in full force
and effect regardless of whether (i) Purchaser obtains at or following the
Closing, or maintains following the Closing, the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy; (ii) the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy is,
for any reason, terminated, revoked, cancelled, exhausted, modified, amended
or otherwise altered in any form; or (iii) any claim is made by a Purchaser
Indemnified Person under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy and
such claim is denied by the Insurer.

  



  

(b) Seller agrees to reimburse Purchaser, promptly upon demand, for any
Losses (as defined in the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy) (other
than Losses that are fully indemnified by Seller pursuant to _Section 9.2_ )
incurred (i) within the Retention (as defined in the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy) and (ii) with respect to a breach or inaccuracy of
the Seller Representations, that are in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the
Retention until the Retention has been fully eroded (it being understood that
the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall bear all Losses constituting the first
fifty percent (50%) of the Retention). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, any rights of the Insurer under the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy shall not affect and do not affect, expand or increase any
liability or obligation of Seller to Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified
Person in connection with the Transactions. Purchaser shall not amend or
supplement the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy, without the prior
written consent of Seller if such amendment or supplement would reasonably be
expected to materially expand Seller's obligation to reimburse Purchaser for
losses below the Retention pursuant to this _Section 9.8_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy, (x) at no time shall the Retention exceed
$3,943,912 (or, if the FidelityLink Acquisition shall not have been
consummated on or prior to the Closing, $3,877,500) (the " _Retention_ _Cap_
"), (y) from and after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, except to
the extent expressly provided in Section IV(B)(ii) of the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy (but in any event subject to the Retention Cap), the
Retention shall be reduced to an amount not to exceed $1,971,956 (or, if the
FidelityLink Acquisition shall not have been consummated on or prior to the
Closing, $1,938,750) and (z) to the extent Purchaser fails to bind the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy or the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy is terminated, Seller shall have no obligation to
reimburse Purchaser with respect to any Retention.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_**. Subject to (a) any recourse
available under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy or under
_Section 9.8_ ; (b) disputes under _Section_ _2.3_ and _Section_ _10.5_ ,
which shall be resolved in accordance with the mechanisms thereunder; and (c)
the rights of the parties under _Section_ _6.10(_ _k_ _)_ and _Section_ _11.9_
, the parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing their sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article_ _IX_.
Nothing in this _Section_ _9.9_ , shall limit any Person's right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to
_Section_ _11.9_ or to seek any remedy on account of intentional fraud by any
party or with respect to any breach of any covenant or agreement that by its
terms contemplates performance after the Closing. For purposes of
clarification, Purchaser's remedies prior to Closing are subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 8.2_ of this Agreement.

or change any Tax election or accounting method that has retroactive effect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period of Seller or any of the Group Companies or (v)

reimburse the filing party for any Transfer Taxes that are borne by Purchaser
or the Seller, respectively, pursuant to this _Section 10.3_. Purchaser and
Seller shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and
forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all

Taxes payable in connection herewith.

the Ad Insertion Business for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Seller, or
any Seller Group member, could be liable under this Agreement or otherwise ("
_Seller Tax Contest_ ").

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Seller shall have the right, at its election, to control, at its own
expense, any Seller Tax Contest, including any disposition of such Seller Tax
Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Purchaser shall have the right, at
its own expense, directly or through its designated representatives, to
participate fully in such Seller Tax Contest, including to review in advance
and reasonably comment on submissions made in the course of such Seller Tax
Contest and to attend any in-person or telephonic meetings, and (ii)
Purchaser's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)

Seller Group and would not be borne by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including
the Group Companies (as evidenced by a written confirmation to that effect
from Seller); _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall not be entitled to
control a Seller Tax Contest if an Insurer under the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy is required to control such Seller Tax Contest
pursuant to the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy (so long as
Seller has consented to any provisions of or amendments to such policy that
relate to such assumption) (it being understood that Seller has consented to
the provisions of the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy as in
effect on the date hereof).

  



  

(c) With respect to all Seller Tax Contests that Seller does not elect to
control pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall have
the sole responsibility for, and shall control, at its own expense, such
Seller Tax Contest, including the disposition thereof; _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) Seller shall have the right to participate fully in such Seller Tax
Contest at its own expense, including to review in advance and reasonably
comment on submissions made in the course of such Seller Tax Contest and to
attend any in-person or telephonic meetings, (ii) Purchaser shall diligently
pursue such Seller Tax Contest in good faith as if it were the sole party in
interest ( _provided_ that failure to do so will not give rise to any
liability of any Indemnified Person to Seller) and (iii) Seller's consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or denied) shall be
required for any settlement that could affect the liability of any member of
the Seller Group.

  



  

(d) Purchaser shall have the sole right to control any Tax Contest
relating to any of the Group Companies, the Business or the Ad Insertion
Business **** that is not a Seller Tax Contest.

disagreement as to any Tax matter covered in this Agreement (other than Third-
Party Claims that are not Tax Contests), Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days to resolve such disagreement.
In the event any such disagreement cannot be resolved between Purchaser and
Seller, such disagreement shall be resolved by an accounting firm of
international reputation (or, in the case of a disagreement regarding the
valuation of any item reflected in the Allocation, by a valuation firm)
mutually agreeable to, and retained by, Purchaser and Seller (any such firm,
the " _Tax Arbitrator_ "), and any such determination by the Tax Arbitrator
shall be final, absent fraud, mathematical error or failure to make a
determination in accordance with this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the
Tax Arbitrator shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on the disputed items resolved by the Tax Arbitrator. Such
proportional allocations shall be determined by the Tax Arbitrator at the time
its determination is rendered on the disputed items. If the Tax Arbitrator
does not resolve any differences between Purchaser and Seller with respect to
a Tax Return at least five (5) days prior to the due date therefor, such Tax
Return shall be filed in a manner consistent with the position of the party
responsible for filing such Tax Return pursuant to _Section 10.2_ and, to the
extent necessary and permitted under applicable Law, amended to reflect the
Tax Arbitrator's resolution. This _Section 10.5_ shall apply to Tax disputes
(other than Third-Party Claims that are not Tax Contests) notwithstanding
_Section 9.3_.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 10.6 _Cooperation_**. Following the Closing, each of
Purchaser, Seller and the Group Companies agrees that it shall cooperate with
and make available to the other parties hereto, during normal business hours,
all books and records, information and employees (without substantial
disruption of employment) retained and remaining in existence after the
Closing that are necessary or useful in connection with the preparation of any
Tax Returns and any Tax Contest, including the computation and verification of
any amounts paid or payable under this _Article X_ (including any supporting
workpapers, schedules and documents). The party requesting any such books,
records, information or employees shall bear all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for salaries
and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with providing such
books, records, information or employees. Following the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause the Group Companies to retain all applicable Tax Returns, books
and records and workpapers for Pre-Closing Tax Periods for a period of at
least seven (7) years following the Closing Date.

liabilities and other items required to be taken into account for such
purpose) shall be allocated among the assets of the Group Companies in
accordance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder pursuant to a written allocation delivered by Seller to
Purchaser within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the

(c) The Allocation will not be final without the mutual consent of
Purchaser and Seller, which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed by either party (the Allocation as finalized, the " _Final Allocation_
"). If the Allocation is not finalized within one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the Closing Date, then Purchaser and Seller shall finalize the
Allocation pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section_ _ _ _10.5_.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) Subject to the outcome of a Tax Contest or the provisions of _Section_
_ _ _10.5_ , Purchaser, Seller and the Group Companies shall file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation and
shall not make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any Tax Return or
during the course of any Tax-related matter, or otherwise take any Tax
position inconsistent with the Final Allocation.

  



  

(e) If the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration is adjusted pursuant to
this Agreement, the Final Allocation shall be adjusted as appropriate and
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith in making any such
adjustments.

disclaimed by Seller, (iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, with respect to the Ad Insertion Business and the Ad
Insertion Business Assets, (A) neither Seller nor any other Person makes, or
has made, any express or implied representations or warranties with respect to

Purchaser accepts the Ad Insertion Business Assets on an "AS IS, WHERE IS"
basis and (v) such disavowal and disclaimer is agreed by Purchaser and

made available to Purchaser or its Affiliates or Representatives in certain
"data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of
the Transactions and (2) Purchaser has not relied on any such information,
document or material; _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not limit Purchaser's rights (x) under _Article_ _ _ _IX_ ,
(y) under _Section_ _ _ _11.9_ or (z) with respect to any claim or remedy for
intentional fraud with respect to any of the Seller Representations. Effective

have no indemnification rights (and Seller shall have no liability) in
connection with such obligations.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Letter or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended
to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so
included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including
whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the Disclosure Letter or Exhibits
in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described or included in this Agreement or in
the Disclosure Letter or any Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed
(including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Disclosure Letter and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely
for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of
any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract).
The Disclosure Letter sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of
which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in _Article_ _ _ _III_ , _Article_ _ _
_IV_ , _Article_ _ _ _V_ or to one or more of the covenants contained in
_Article _ _VII_ , except that any information set forth in one Section of
the Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to all other Sections or
subsections thereof to the extent that the applicability of such information
is reasonably apparent from the content and context of such information.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 11.15 _No Recourse_**. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement or otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own
behalf and on behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no
Non-Recourse Party of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions except to the extent
agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse Party; _provided_ that this _Section
11.15_ shall not prejudice or limit any claim or remedy for intentional fraud
with respect to any representation and warranty made by any party in this
Agreement or the officer's certificates delivered pursuant to _Section
7.2(e)_ and _Section 7.3(c)_.

  



  

 **Section 11.16 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_**. It is
acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that Seller has retained
Greensfelder, Hemker and Gale, P.C. (the " _Retained Counsel_ ") to act as its
counsel in connection with the Transactions and that the Retained Counsel has
not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the
Transactions and that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a
client of the Retained Counsel for conflict of interest or any other purposes
as a result thereof. Purchaser and Seller hereby agree, on their own behalf
and on behalf of their respective managers, directors, equityholders, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser and/or the Group Companies
on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, the
Retained Counsel may represent Seller (and any of its Affiliates) in such
dispute even though the interests of Seller (or any of its Affiliates) may be
directly adverse to Purchaser and/or the Group Companies, and even though the
Retained Counsel may have represented the Group Companies in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. Purchaser further agrees that, as to
all communications among the Retained Counsel, Seller, the Group Companies
and/or any of their respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the
Transactions, the attorney-client privilege (as it relates to the Retained
Counsel) and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and shall
not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Group Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Purchaser, the Group Companies or any of their Subsidiaries and
a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Group Companies may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by the
Retained Counsel to such third party or the use thereof by the Retained
Counsel in connection with its representation of a party in such dispute;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Group Company may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of Seller. The Retained Counsel shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 11.16_. ** __**

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 11.17 _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_**. This Agreement
and any signed agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated
hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or
similar attachment to electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
contract, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such
contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through
the use of facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail as a defense to the formation of a contract and
each such party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

 **Section 11.18 _Lender Limitations_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) Seller and its Subsidiaries, and its
and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members and stockholders shall not have any rights or
claims against any Debt Financing Source, in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the Transactions, or in respect of any
document or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or in respect of any
oral or written representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and (b) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any Group Company, and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members, representatives and stockholders for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions or in respect of any oral
or written representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the foregoing
shall not apply to or otherwise be binding upon, Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, and its and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members and stockholders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Debt
Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to the protections of, this provision.
