The fees, costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm shall be borne by the parties in proportion to the relative amount by which each party&rsquo;s determination has been modified. For example, if Seller challenges the calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount by an amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), but the Valuation Firm determines that Seller has a valid claim for only Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000), then Purchaser shall bear forty percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the Valuation Firm and Seller shall bear the other sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses.</p>
