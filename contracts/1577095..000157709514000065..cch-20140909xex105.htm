EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of August 13,
2014, by and among (i) ClubCorp USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"),
(ii) Sequoia Golf Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
"Company"), (iii) Parthenon-Sequoia Ltd., an exempted company incorporated
with limited liability in the Cayman Islands (the "Blocker"), (iv) Parthenon
Investors II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, JandR Founders\' Fund II,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and PCIP Investors, a Delaware general
partnership (collectively, the "Parthenon Sellers"), (v) the members of the
Company set forth on signature pages hereto under the heading "Selling
Members" (individually, a "Selling Member" and collectively, the "Selling
Members," and, together with the Parthenon Sellers, each, a "Seller" and,
collectively, the "Sellers"), and (vi) Parthenon Investors II, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as representative for the
Sellers (the "Representative"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings set forth in Article XI below.

WHEREAS, the Selling Members and the Blocker own collectively all of the
issued and outstanding equity securities of the Company (collectively, the
"Units");

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to purchase from the Selling Members, and the Selling
Members desire to sell to Buyer, all of the Units held by the Selling Members
as of the Closing (collectively, the "Acquired Units") for the consideration
described herein; and

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to purchase from the Parthenon Sellers, and the
Parthenon Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, in lieu of directly acquiring the
Units held by the Blocker as of the Closing, all of the issued and outstanding
ordinary shares of USD $1.00 each in the capital of the Blocker (the "Acquired
Shares" and, together with the Acquired Units, collectively, the "Acquired
Securities"), in each case for the consideration described herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF ACQUIRED SECURITIES

1.01 Purchase and Sale of Acquired Securities. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers will
sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and
acquire from the Sellers, all of the Acquired Securities owned by such Seller
in exchange for the payment of the Estimated Purchase Price in cash to the
Sellers. Payment for such Acquired Securities will be made by wire transfer on
the Closing Date of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
specified by the Representative (which account or accounts, together with the
amounts payable to each Seller, will be designated by the Representative in
writing at least two business days prior to the Closing Date). Each Seller who
is an obligor of an Executive Note shall repay such Executive Note on the
Closing Date in full through a reduction of proceeds paid to such obligor or
Affiliates of such obligor, and, for the avoidance of doubt (without affecting
Section 1.02(a)(iv)) such repayment shall be retained by the Company at
Closing and shall be disregarded when determining Cash at Closing and Net
Working Capital.

1.02 Calculation of Closing and Final Consideration.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Purchase Price" means an amount equal
to:

(i) $265,000,000.00,

(ii) plus the total amount of Cash,

(iii) plus the Buyer Diligence Expenses,

(iv) plus the Executive Note Amount,

(v) minus the outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of the Closing,

(vi) minus the unpaid Transaction Expenses,

(vii) minus the unpaid Sale Bonus Payments,

(viii) plus the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital exceeds the
Upper End Net Working Capital Target,

(ix) minus the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than
the Lower End Net Working Capital Target,

(x) minus the amount of the Deposit (which shall be retained at the Closing by
the Escrow Agent and credited towards payment of the Escrow Amount),

(xi) minus the Remediation Escrow Amount (if applicable),

(xii) minus the Escrow Amount (less the amount of the Deposit), and

(xiii) minus the Representative Holdback Amount.

For the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, the payments referred to
in Sections 1.02(a)(x), (x), (xi) and (xiii) shall be considered part of the
"Purchase Price" but shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.03(d).

(b) As of the date hereof, the Company and Buyer have exchanged an example
calculation of the Purchase Price and the amounts payable to the Sellers (with
estimates for amounts that are not final as of the date hereof or subject to
change between the date hereof and the Closing Date). At least two business
days prior to the Closing Date, the Representative will deliver to Buyer the
Sellers\' good faith estimate of the Purchase Price (the "Estimated Purchase
Price"), which shall include Sellers\' good faith estimate of Cash,
outstanding Indebtedness as of the Closing, unpaid Transaction Expenses,
unpaid Sales Bonus Payments and Net Working Capital.

(c) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer will deliver to the Representative (i) an unaudited, consolidated
balance sheet of the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing (which will have been prepared with the assistance of Buyer\'s or the
Company\'s accountants), and (ii) Buyer\'s calculation of the Purchase Price,
including its calculation of Cash, outstanding Indebtedness as of the Closing,
unpaid Transaction

\- 2 -



Expenses, unpaid Sales Bonus Payments and Net Working Capital, together with
back-up and support for such calculation (together, the "Closing Statement").
The Closing Statement will be prepared in a manner consistent with the
definitions of Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Net Working
Capital and the accounting principles and practices referred to therein.
Except as set forth in the definition of Net Working Capital with respect to
Transaction Tax Deductions, the Closing Statement will entirely disregard (i)
any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the Blocker, the Company
and its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or of
any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or
any other transaction entered into by Buyer in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any of the
plans, transactions, or changes which Buyer intends to initiate or make or
cause to be initiated or made after the Closing with respect to the Blocker,
the Company and its Subsidiaries or their business or assets, or any facts or
circumstances that are unique or particular to Buyer or any of its assets or
liabilities.

(d) Buyer will, and will cause the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, (i) assist the Representative and its representatives in the review of the
Closing Statement and provide the Representative and its representatives with
access during normal business hours to the books, records (including work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities
and employees of the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably
necessary for purposes of their review of the Closing Statement, and (ii)
cooperate with the Representative and its representatives in connection with
such review, including providing on a timely basis all other information
necessary or useful in connection with the review of the Closing Statement as
is reasonably requested by the Representative or its representatives. If the
Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement, the Representative
will deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an
"Objections Statement"), which statement will identify in reasonable detail
those items and amounts to which the Representative objects (the "Disputed
Items"). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer within 30 days
after delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement as prepared by
Buyer will be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The
Representative and Buyer will negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed
Items and all such discussions related thereto will (unless otherwise agreed
by Buyer and the Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, but if they do not reach a
final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the Objections Statement
to Buyer, the Representative and Buyer will submit any unresolved Disputed
Items to Ernst and Young (the "Accounting Firm"). In the event the parties
submit any unresolved Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm, each party will
submit a Closing Statement (which in the case of each party may be a Closing
Statement that, with respect to the unresolved Disputed Items (but not, for
the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other items), is different than
the Closing Statement initially submitted to the Representative, or the
Objections Statement delivered to Buyer, as applicable) together with such
supporting documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Accounting Firm
within 30 days after the date on which such unresolved Disputed Items were
submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution. The Accounting Firm shall
determine the Disputed Items in a manner that is consistent with this
Agreement. The determination of each Disputed Item shall be within the range
between that established by the Closing Statement and the Objection Statement.
The Representative and Buyer will use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon as
practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on which the
Accounting Firm receives the Closing Statements prepared by the Representative
and Buyer. The Representative and Buyer will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to notify them in writing of
its resolution of such dispute as soon as practicable. The Accounting Firm
shall act as an arbitrator to determine only the Disputed Items, and the


 

---

|

\- 3 -



Accounting Firm\'s resolution of the unresolved Disputed Items will be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto absent manifest error. Each
party will bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution
of such dispute by the Accounting Firm. The costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be split equally between Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand.

(e) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.02(d)
(the "Final Purchase Price") is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then, within five business days after the determination of Final Purchase
Price, Buyer will pay an amount equal to such excess to the Sellers, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts and in the
amounts designated by the Representative in writing.

(f) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then, within five business days after the determination of Final Purchase
Price, Buyer and the Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
pay to Buyer, from the Adjustment Escrow Funds (and if such amount is
insufficient, the Indemnity Escrow Funds), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts and in the amounts designated by
Buyer in writing, an amount equal to such shortfall; provided that if the
Indemnity Escrow Funds are withdrawn to pay to Buyer any shortfall, the
Sellers, based upon each Seller's Adjustment Pro Rata Portion, shall replenish
such withdrawn amount within 15 Business Days of such withdraw. To the extent
any amounts remain with respect to the Adjustment Escrow Funds after giving
effect to such distribution, Buyer and the Representative will instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse such remaining amount to the Representative (for
further distribution to the Sellers based on their Adjustment Pro Rata
Portion).

(g) All payments required pursuant to Section 1.02(e), Section 1.02(f) and
Section 8.09 will be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the Purchase
Price.

1.03 Deposit. On the date hereof, Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent
Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the "Deposit"). The Deposit shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as the Escrow
Agent shall designate and shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement, to be entered into as of the date
hereof by Buyer, the Representative and the Escrow Agent. At the Closing, the
Deposit shall be retained by the Escrow Agent and applied towards the Escrow
Amount to be held in accordance with the Indemnification, Remediation and
Adjustment Escrow Agreement. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
Buyer or by the Sellers in accordance with the terms hereof, the Deposit shall
be disbursed by the Escrow Agent based upon the applicable events giving rise
to such termination in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.03.

1.04 Remediation Escrow Amount. In the event that further remedial action is
required on the Closing Date for any of the Remediation Sites pursuant to
Section 8.09, at Closing, Buyer shall deposit from the Purchase Price (in
accordance with Section 1.02(a)(xi)) with the Escrow Agent the Remediation
Escrow Amount. The Remediation Escrow Amount shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account (the "Remediation Escrow Account")
as the Escrow Agent shall designate and shall be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of the Indemnification, Remediation and Adjustment
Escrow Agreement. The Remediation Escrow Amount shall be disbursed as provided
in Section 8.09 and pursuant to the terms of the Indemnification, Remediation
and Adjustment Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if no further
remedial action is required for each of the Remediation Sites at or prior to
Closing, the Remediation Escrow Amount shall not be paid to the Escrow Agent
and instead shall be paid to the Representative to be distributed to the
Sellers pursuant to the Indemnity Pro Rata Portion.

1.05 Representative Holdback Amount. The Representative Holdback Amount will
be retained by the Representative for such time as the Representative will
determine in its sole discretion, on behalf of the Sellers to satisfy
potential future obligations of the Sellers, including any expenses of the
Representative or the Sellers arising from the defense of claims by the
Representative pursuant to Section 10.02 and for fees and expenses (including
legal fees) incurred by the Representative in its capacity as such either
before or after the Closing. Any remaining amounts distributed from the
Representative Holdback Amount will be distributed to the Sellers.

1.06 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis
LLP, located at 300 North LaSalle St., Chicago, Illinois, on the second
business day following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Article II, or such other date as Buyer and the Representative

| | 

|

\- 14 -



and the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company holds a valid and existing
leasehold interest under each such lease, subject to proper authorization and
execution of such lease by the other party and the application of any
bankruptcy or creditor\'s rights laws. The Company has delivered or made
available to Buyer copies of each of the leases described on Schedule 5.08(c),
and none of such leases has been modified in any material respect, except to
the extent that such modifications are disclosed by the copies delivered or
made available to Buyer. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in any material respect under any of
such leases.

(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.08(d), to the knowledge of the Company,
the Real Property is currently in compliance with all applicable building,
zoning, subdivision, health and safety and other land use Laws (collectively,
the "Real Property Laws"), and the current use or occupancy of the Real
Property or operation of the business thereon does not violate, in any
material respect, any Real Property Laws. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have received any written notice of a pending or threatened
investigation regarding a potential violation of any applicable law which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have received written
notice of, nor do they have any knowledge of, any default or breach by the
Company, its Subsidiaries, or the Real Property under any covenants,
conditions, restrictions, rights-of-way or easements affecting the Real
Property or any portion thereof which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and no such default or breach now exists, nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, has any event occurred which, with the giving of
notice, the passage to time, or both, would constitute such a breach or
default which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

thereto or any easement benefiting such property, is subject to temporary
requisition of use or any condemnation proceeding by any Governmental Body or
has been condemned, or taken in any proceeding similar to a condemnation
proceeding, nor, to the Company\'s knowledge, is there now pending any
condemnation, expropriation, requisition or similar proceeding against the
Real Property or any portion thereof. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have received any written notice that any such proceeding is
contemplated.

(g) To the Company\'s knowledge, none of the Real Property has been classified
under any designation authorized by applicable law solely for the purpose of
obtaining a special low ad valorem tax rate or to receive either an abatement
or deferment of ad valorem taxes which, in such case, will result in
additional, catch-up ad valorem taxes in the future in order to recover the
amounts previously abated or deferred. To the Company\'s knowledge, there are
no minimum value, minimum tax or other written agreements with respect to the
Real Property or any portion of it which would restrict Buyer\'s right to
contest the value or taxes attributable to the Real Property.

existed hereunder by reason of such inaccuracy or breach, and the Sellers will
not have any claim (whether for indemnification or otherwise) against Buyer
for any such breach or inaccuracy. Buyer will promptly notify the
Representative, the Blocker and the Company if Buyer obtains knowledge that
any of the representations and warranties of the Sellers, the Blocker or the
Company in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules hereto are not true and
correct in all material respects, or if Buyer obtains knowledge of any
breaches of any covenants or agreements in this Agreement or material errors
in, or omissions from, the Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement.

8.03 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer will not, and will not
permit the Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal
or modify any provision in the Blocker\'s, the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
governing documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses of any current and former officers, directors and/or
direct or indirect equityholders (each, an "DandO Indemnified Person") (unless
required by law) in a manner that is detrimental to such DandO Indemnified
Persons, it being the intent of the parties that the officers and directors of
the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be entitled to
such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the extent
provided by such governing documents immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 8.03 and not
in limitation thereof, from and after the Closing, Buyer will, and will cause
the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a "DandO Indemnifying
Party") to, to the extent provided by the governing documents of Blocker
immediately prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i)
indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any liability to Buyer or the
Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), the DandO Indemnified Persons
against all DandO Expenses (as defined below), losses, claims, damages,
judgments or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "DandO Costs") in respect
of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising
out or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer
of the Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing (including in respect of acts
or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby) (a "DandO Indemnifiable Claim"), and (ii) advance to such
DandO Indemnified Persons all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense of such claim) promptly after receipt of
reasonably detailed statements therefor. Any DandO Indemnifiable Claims will
continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all judgments,
orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such DandO Indemnifiable
Claim are fully satisfied. For the purposes of this Section 8.03(b), "DandO
Expenses" will include attorneys\' fees and all other costs, charges and
expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend,
to be a witness in or participate in, any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but will
exclude Losses, claims, damages, judgments and amounts paid in settlement
(which items are included in the definition of DandO Costs).

(c) At the Closing, Sellers will, or will cause the Blocker, the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, at Sellers\' expense, obtain, maintain and fully pay for
irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as
direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years from the
Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Blocker\'s, the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' current insurance
carrier with respect to directors\' liability insurance in an amount and scope
at least as favorable as the Blocker\'s, the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Closing Date. Buyer will not, or will cause the Blocker, the Company and
its Subsidiaries to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any
respect.

(d) Buyer hereby acknowledges (on behalf of itself and its respective
Subsidiaries) that the DandO Indemnified Persons may have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by current
equityholders, members, or other Affiliates of the Sellers or their respective
equityholders ("Indemnitee Affiliates") separate from the indemnification
obligations of Buyer hereunder. The parties hereto hereby agree (i) that
Buyer, the Blocker and the Company are the indemnitors of first resort (i.e.,
their obligations to the DandO Indemnified Persons are primary and any
obligation of any Indemnitee Affiliate to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the DandO
Indemnified Persons are secondary), and (ii) that Buyer, the Blocker and the
Company will be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by
the DandO Indemnified Persons and will be liable for the full amount of all
expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the
extent legally permitted, without regard to any rights the DandO Indemnified
Persons may have against any Indemnitee Affiliate.

(e) In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the Blocker,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are sold, whether in one transaction or
a series of transactions, then Buyer, the Blocker, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will, in each such case, use commercially reasonable

|

\- 28 -



best efforts to cause the successors and assigns of the Blocker, the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 8.03. The provisions of this Section 8.03(e) will apply to all of
the successors and assigns of the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries.

8.04 Regulatory Filings.

(a) Buyer and the Company will make or cause to be made all filings and
submissions under any laws or regulations necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein and, in each case, include in each such
filing or submission a request for early termination or acceleration of any
applicable waiting or review periods, to the extent available under the
applicable laws or regulations. Subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, the Company will have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable will consult with Buyer on, all the information
that appears in any filings required to be filed by Buyer. In exercising the
foregoing right, the Company will act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. All fees associated with all filings and submissions referred to
in this Section 8.04(a), if any, shall be shared equally between Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand.

(b) Buyer and the Company will comply with any additional requests for
information, including requests for production of documents and production of
witnesses for interviews or depositions by any Governmental Body. Buyer agrees
to use reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any law that may be asserted by any Governmental Body or any other
Person so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the transactions
contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Section 8.04(b), the "reasonable
best efforts" of Buyer will include but not be limited to (i) opposing any
motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction or order
against or preventing or delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) proposing, negotiating, committing to, entering into
and effecting a consent decree, consent agreement or other agreement or
arrangement containing Buyer\'s agreement to hold separate, license, sell
and/or divest (pursuant to such terms as may be required by any Governmental
Body) such assets or businesses of Buyer and its Affiliates and/or the Blocker
and the Company after the Closing (including proposing, negotiating,
committing to, entering into and effecting customary ancillary agreements
relating to any such sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such
assets or businesses), and (iii) agreeing to such limitations on conduct or
actions of Buyer and its Affiliates and/or the Blocker and the Company after
the Closing as may be required in order to obtain satisfaction of the closing
conditions set forth in Section 2.01.

(c) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Buyer will not take any
action, or refrain from taking any action, the effect of which would be
reasonably likely to delay or impede the ability of the parties hereto to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer will not, and will not permit any of its
Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with,
or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by
any other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation
could reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other approvals of
any Governmental Body necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Body entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv)
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Buyer and the Company will keep each other apprised of the status of all
filings and submissions referred to in Section 8.04(a) above, including
promptly furnishing to each other


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 29 -



copies of notices or other communications received in connection therewith.
Neither party will permit any of its officers, employees or other
representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Body in respect of such filings and submissions unless it consults with the
other in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives
the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

8.05 Conditions. Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 2.03 to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible after the
satisfaction (or waiver by the applicable party) of the conditions set forth
in Article II (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing).

8.06 Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations. Prior to
the Closing, Buyer will not (and will cause its affiliates and its and their
representatives to not) contact or communicate with the employees, customers,
suppliers, members, and other business relations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (or
otherwise in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) without prior
consultation with and written approval of the Company (which approval may not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

8.07 Deposit Refund Obligations. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
applicable Subsidiary (and not the Sellers) shall be solely responsible for
all transfer fees and/or refund obligations relating to any of the Refundable
Initiation Fees, including all thirty (30) year deposit refund obligations
relating thereto, it being understood and agreed that such amounts shall not
be prorated.

8.08 Financing. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the financing contemplated by the Sixth Amendment, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to be available at Closing. Prior to the
Closing, upon reasonable request of Buyer, the Company shall provide good
faith cooperation to Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the financing
contemplated by the Sixth Amendment; provided, however, that such good faith
cooperation shall in no event require the Company (or its Subsidiaries, the
Blocker, the Sellers or any of their respective representatives) to: (i)
furnish the Buyer (or any other Person) with any documents or information that
(x) is not readily available and in the Company\'s possession, (y) the Company
or its Subsidiaries is required by legal requirements or governmental order to
keep confidential, or (z) that would be reasonably expected to jeopardize the
status of such document or information as privileged, work product or as a
trade secret, (ii) execute any documentation, provide any opinions (solvency
or otherwise) or accountant comfort letters, prepare any financial statements
(including any Regulation S-X compliant financial statements), (iii) take any
actions which may disrupt the business or which are otherwise not commercially
reasonable or (iv) incur any liability in connection with, related to or
arising from the financing; provided, however, that nothing set forth in this
Section 8.08 shall limit the liability of the Sellers to Buyer following the
Closing with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Articles III, IV and V hereof. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) incurred in connection with
the cooperation contemplated by this Section 8.08. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Blocker nor any
Seller will be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur
any liability in connection with the financing (other than the Company
following the Closing Date for which the Buyer will be responsible). The
Company will be deemed in compliance with this Section 8.08, and the Buyer may
not allege that the Company is or has not been in compliance with this Section
8.08, unless Buyer provides prompt written notice of the alleged failure to
comply specifying in reasonable detail specific steps to cure such alleged
failure to comply in a commercially reasonable and practicable manner
consistent with this Section 8.08, which failure has not been cured within ten
(10) Business Days from receipt of such written notice (in which case, at the
Company\'s

\- 30 -



or Buyer's election, the Outside Date may also be extended by ten (10)
Business Days (for the avoidance such extension may only occur once)).

8.09 Remediation.

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company (after the
Closing, as directed by the Representative but subject to the Company's
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
solely utilizing funds from the Remediation Escrow Account, shall engage EFI
or another environmental consultant mutually agreed to by Buyer and the
Representative to investigate the specified areas at the specified Real
Property as described on Schedule 8.09 (solely with respect to such specified
areas which are each separately listed on Schedule 8.09 by numbers 1 through
9, a "Remediation Site" and collectively, the "Remediation Sites"). For those
areas where the results of the investigation do not indicate the presence of
contamination above applicable regulatory cleanup standards the Company, the
Blocker, the Sellers and the Representative shall have no additional
obligation with respect to such Remediation Site and a Clearance Certificate
shall have been deemed obtained with respect to such Remediation Site as
required pursuant to this Section 8.09. For those areas where the results of
the investigation indicate the presence of contamination above applicable
regulatory standards the Company (after the Closing, as directed by the
Representative but subject to the Company's consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to commence promptly and conduct the required remediation
of the area in order to comply with applicable regulatory cleanup standards.

(b) The Representative or the Company, as the case may be, shall provide
copies of all related remediation work and plans and environmental reports to
Buyer and the Representative as such remediation is being conducted. In
addition, such remediation shall be conducted in accordance with the following
provisions:

(i) The Company shall not be required (regardless of the direction by the
Representative) to conduct any remediation at unreasonable times or in a
manner to cause a material disruption of the Company\'s business operations on
the Real Property;

(ii) The Company shall not be required (regardless of the direction by the
Representative) to conduct any remediation (A) that violates any applicable
Environmental Laws; (B) without obtaining all permits, licenses, or other
authorizations necessary to conduct the remediation, (C) that does not
substantially comply with reasonable staging, storage, handling, access and
other logistical parameters; or (D) that requires actions that pose an
unreasonable threat to the safety or health of persons or the environment, or
cause unreasonable damage to the Real Property or other Real Property of the
Company or other persons;

(iii) At the conclusion of the remediation, the Representative shall direct
the Company to (i) remove all equipment associated with the remediation and
restore the Real Property to substantially its condition prior to any
remediation, including replacing, refilling and regrading any holes or borings
made in, or excavations of, any portion of the Real Property used for such
remediation, and replacing or repairing any asphalt, concrete, or other
surface cover (including repainting any surface markings) damaged during the
remediation; and (ii) promptly close in accordance with all applicable
Environmental Laws


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 31 -



all borings and wells constructed as part of the remediation, unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties; and

(iv) The Buyer and the Representative shall be permitted to have
representatives present during all remediation undertaken following the
Closing hereunder and be provided with, upon request and to the extent
practicable, split samples of any samples collected by the Representative.

(c) Remediation shall be deemed complete upon a written indication from the
appropriate governmental authority that no further remedial action is required
in order to comply with applicable regulatory cleanup standards, or if no
written notification of the contamination to a governmental authority is
required by law (including contamination excluded from notification because it
is cleaned up within 30 days of discovery, to the extent applicable), then
upon a written report from the environmental consultant conducting such
remediation that no further remedial action is required in order to comply
with applicable regulatory cleanup standards (any such written indication or
report a "Clearance Certificate"). In no event shall remediation include
placing any restrictive covenant on the use of the Remediation Site. Upon
receipt (or deemed receipt) of a Clearance Certificate, the Company, the
Blocker, the Sellers and the Representative shall have no further obligation
with respect to such Remediation Site. If any such remediation extends beyond
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide the Representative reasonable access to
the relevant Remediation Site in order to permit the conduct and completion of
such remediation. If Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
fails to provide such access to the Representative, or materially delays the
Representative from accessing any Remediation Sites then the Representative,
the Blocker, and the Sellers shall have been deemed to have fulfilled all
obligations with respect to such Remediation Site and such site shall be
deemed to have received a Clearance Certificate; provided, however, the
Representative may not allege that Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates have breached their obligation to provide reasonable
access or caused a material delay unless the Representative provides prompt
written notice of the alleged failure to provide reasonable access or cause a
material delay specifying in reasonable detail specific steps to cure such
alleged failure in a commercially reasonable and practicable manner consistent
with this Section 8.09, which failure has not been cured within ten (10)
Business Days from receipt of such written notice. The costs of any
investigation or remediation and site restoration conducted pursuant to this
Section 8.09 after the Closing Date (other than the analysis of split samples)
shall be paid solely by and out of, and shall be limited to amounts in the
Remediation Escrow and the Sellers and the Representative shall have no
obligation with respect to the Remediation Sites, including any investigation
or remediation, beyond the Remediation Escrow Amount which, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, is the sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any matters arising out of or relating to the Remediation
Sites. In the event the Company or the Representative obtain or are deemed to
have obtained a Clearance Certificate with respect to all of the Remediation
Sites, Buyer and the Representative will issue joint instructions to the
Escrow Agent to release all remaining amounts in the Remediation Escrow
Account to the Representative. In the event the Company or Representative do
not obtain a Clearance Certificate for each of the Remediation Sites prior to
the date that is six months after the Closing Date (which may be extended, at
the sole option of the Representative, to the date which is fifteen months
after the Closing Date), then the Representative and Buyer shall engage the
environmental consultant conducting such remediation to provide its good faith
estimate of the remaining costs to obtain any outstanding Clearance
Certificates, which if a range is given such estimate shall be deemed to be
the highpoint of the range (such remaining amount the "Estimated Remaining
Remediation Cost"), and to the extent that the actual remaining remediation
costs are less than the Estimated Remaining Remediation


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 32 -



Cost, the Company shall promptly refund the difference to the Representative.
Promptly following such determination of the Estimated Remaining Remediation
Cost, the Representative and Buyer will issue joint instructions to the Escrow
Agent to (x) release an amount equal to the Estimated Remaining Remediation
Cost (for the avoidance of doubt such amount shall not to exceed the remaining
Remediation Escrow Amount) to the Buyer and (y) the amount, if any, remaining
in the Remediation Escrow Account to the Representative.

(d) For purposes of clarity, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
provisions set forth in this Section 8.09 represent the sole and exclusive
provisions relating to the Sellers\' and Representative\'s obligations
relating to or arising out of the Remediation Sites and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall any Seller,
Blocker or the Representative have any indemnity or other obligations related
to or arising from any Remediation Site other than for amounts contained in
the Remediation Escrow Account and the use of such amounts set forth therein
or the release of such amounts pursuant to the last sentence in Section
8.09(a). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, once all amounts in
the Remediation Escrow Account, whether released to Buyer or the
Representative, any and all claims with related to or arising from any of the
Remediation Sites and any liability with respect thereof will terminate and
expire once the Remediation Escrow Amount is zero.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION

9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(g) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and the Representative;

(h) by Buyer, if there has been a material breach by the Blocker, the Company
or the Sellers of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any
condition (other than Section 2.02(f)) to the obligations of Buyer at the
Closing and such breach has not been waived by Buyer or, in the case of a
covenant or agreement breach, cured (to the extent curable) by the Blocker,
the Company or the Sellers within 10 days after written notice thereof from
Buyer; provided, however, Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.01(b) if it is in material breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement;

(i) by the Representative, if there has been a material breach by Buyer of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of
the Blocker, the Company and the Sellers at the Closing and such breach has
not been waived by the Representative or, in the case of a covenant or
agreement breach, cured by Buyer within 10 days after written notice thereof
by the Representative (provided that the failure to deliver the full
consideration payable pursuant to Article I under this Agreement at the
Closing as required hereunder will not be subject to cure hereunder unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Representative); provided, however, the
Representative may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.01(c) if any of the Blocker, the Company or the Sellers is in material
breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement; or

(j) by either Buyer or the Representative if the transactions contemplated
hereby have not been consummated by 5:00 p.m., New York City time on October
17, 2014 (the "Outside Date"); provided that neither Buyer nor the
Representative will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.01(d) if such Person\'s knowing or willful breach of this Agreement
has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

\- 33 -



9.02 Effect of Termination. Except as set forth in Section 9.03, in the event
of the termination of this Agreement by either Buyer or the Representative as
provided above, the provisions of this Agreement will immediately become void
and of no further force or effect (other than this Section 9.02, Section 9.03
and Article XII which will survive the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their terms); provided, however, that the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated March 14, 2014, between the Company and ClubCorp USA, Inc.
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") will survive the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms therein, and there will be no other
liability on the part of any of the parties to one another. Nothing in this
Article IX will be deemed to impair the right of any party to compel specific
performance pursuant to Section 12.19 by the other party of their obligations
under this Agreement; provided, however, in the event that a party terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, specific performance pursuant to
Section 12.19 will not be an available remedy to any party.

9.03 Disbursement of Deposit.

(a) In the event of a termination by Buyer pursuant to Sections 9.01(a) or
9.01(b), the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to immediately return the
Deposit to Buyer and, if the Representative does not issue such instruction to
the Escrow Agent within five (5) Business Day after such termination, Sellers
shall pay all of Buyer\'s Enforcement Costs for the disbursement of the
Deposit. Further, in the event of a termination by Buyer pursuant to Section
9.01(b), the Company shall reimburse Buyer in an amount up to $250,000 for the
actual out-of-pocket costs and fees incurred by Buyer in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the due diligence undertaken
by Buyer and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, costs of outside legal counsel and third party consultants). For
the avoidance of doubt, this shall not include the Buyer Diligence Expenses,
which are the Company\'s responsibility. Upon such disbursement and payment,
the Sellers, Blocker, the Representative and Buyer shall have no further
obligations under this Agreement, except those which expressly survive such
termination.

(b) In the event the Representative terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(c), the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to immediately
disburse the Deposit to the Sellers; provided, however, if Buyer does not
issue such instruction to the Escrow Agent within five (5) Business Day after
such termination, Buyer shall pay all of Sellers\', the Representative\'s and
the Company\'s Enforcement Costs for the disbursement of the Deposit, and upon
such disbursement and, if applicable, payment of Enforcement Costs, the
Sellers, Blocker, the Representative and Buyer shall have no further
obligations under this Agreement, except those which expressly survive such
termination.

(c) In the event that either party terminates pursuant to Section 9.01(d) due
to (i) the failure of the condition set forth in Section 2.01(a) or (ii) a
failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 2.02 (other than Section
2.02(f) to be satisfied) (provided, however, for purposes of this Section
9.03(c), such conditions shall be deemed satisfied if on or prior to the
Outside Date, the Company provides written notice certifying to Buyer that
such parties can comply with each of the conditions set forth in Section 2.02
(other than Section 2.02(f)) and that the Sellers, Blocker and the Company are
ready and prepared to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to immediately return the Deposit to
Buyer and, if the Representative does not issue such instruction to the Escrow
Agent within five (5) Business Day after such termination, Sellers shall pay
all of Buyer\'s Enforcement Costs for the disbursement of the Deposit. Upon
such disbursement and payment, the Sellers, Blocker, the Representative and
Buyer shall have no further obligations under this Agreement, except those
which expressly survive such termination.

|

\- 34 -



(d) In the event that either party terminates pursuant to Section 9.01(d) for
any reason other than as specified in Section 9.03(c), the parties shall cause
the Escrow Agent to immediately disburse the Deposit to the Sellers; provided,
however, if Buyer does not issue such instruction to the Escrow Agent within
five (5) Business Day after such termination, Buyer shall pay all of
Sellers\', the Representative\'s and the Company\'s Enforcement Costs for the
disbursement of the Deposit, and upon such disbursement and, if applicable,
payment of Enforcement Costs, the Sellers, Blocker, the Representative and
Buyer shall have no further obligations under this Agreement, except those
which expressly survive such termination.

(e) THE BUYER AND SELLERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE
IMPRACTICAL AND/OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIX OR ESTABLISH THE ACTUAL DAMAGE
SUSTAINED BY THE SELLERS AS A RESULT OF ANY EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE
DISBURSEMENT OF THE DEPOSIT TO THE SELLERS PURSUANT TO 9.03(B) OR 9.03(D), AND
AGREE THAT THE DEPOSIT IS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION THEREOF. ACCORDINGLY, IN
THE EVENT THAT BUYER BREACHES THIS AGREEMENT BY DEFAULTING IN THE COMPLETION
OF THE PURCHASE OF THE ACQUIRED SECURITIES, THE DEPOSIT PLUS ANY ENFORCEMENT
COSTS SHALL CONSTITUTE AND BE DEEMED TO BE THE AGREED AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
OF THE SELLERS, AND SHALL BE PAID BY THE ESCROW AGENT TO THE SELLERS AS THE
SELLERS' FULL, SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AVAILABLE TO SELLERS FOR ANY FAILURE
OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY TO BE CONSUMMATED IN THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY AT LAW OR IN EQUITY TO
WHICH SELLER MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED. THE PAYMENT OF THE DEPOSIT AS
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY, BUT IS
INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO THE SELLERS.

ARTICLE X 

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

10.01 Survival. The representations and warranties contained in Article III,
Article IV, Article V and Article VI will survive the Closing and will
terminate and be of no further force and effect on the date that is 15 months
after the Closing Date, provided, however, that the Fundamental
Representations shall survive the Closing and expire on the date that is three
years after the Closing Date; provided further, however, (i) the covenants and
agreements contained in Article VII and Article VIII will terminate on the
Closing Date (and no claim for indemnification may be made therefor) unless a
specific covenant or agreement contained in Article VII and Article VIII
requires performance after the Closing Date, in which case such covenant or
agreement will survive for a period of 30 days following the date on which the
performance of such covenant or agreement is required to be completed and (ii)
the covenants and agreements set forth in Article X, Article XI and Article
XII will survive in accordance with the terms thereof. No claim for
indemnification hereunder for breach of any such representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements may be made after the expiration of such applicable
survival period. Any indemnity claim pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(iii) must be
made within 15 months after the Closing Date other than with respect to clause
(i) of the definition of "Specified Indemnifiable Liabilities", which must be
made no later than the end of the statute of limitations applicable thereto.

10.02 Indemnification for the Benefit of the Buyer Indemnitees.

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of
this Article X), Buyer, the Blocker, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, directors,

|

\- 35 -



employees and agents (the "Buyer Indemnitees") will be indemnified by the
Sellers (on a separate, and not joint and several, basis based on their
respective Indemnity Pro Rata Share, except with respect to the Parthenon
Sellers, which shall be on a joint and several basis as among the Parthenon
Sellers), in respect of any actual out-of-pocket loss (hereinafter
individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") suffered or incurred by any
such Buyer Indemnitee with respect to a period prior to the Closing to the
extent such Loss results from (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Sellers, the Blocker or the Company
contained in Article III, Article IV and Article V of this Agreement, (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement of a Seller contained in this Agreement
(for the avoidance of doubt, excluding this Article X) requiring performance
by such Seller after the Closing, and (iii) any Specified Indemnifiable
Liabilities.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, even
if a Buyer Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to recover a Loss under
Section 10.02(a):

(i) no Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification for a Loss
under Section 10.02(a)(i) (other than for a breach of a Fundamental
Representation) if, with respect to any individual item of Loss, such item is
less than $50,000 ("Minor Claim"); and

(ii) no Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification under Section
10.02(a)(i) (other than for a breach of a Fundamental Representation) unless
the aggregate of all Losses under Section 10.02(a)(i) (other than for a breach
of a Fundamental Representation) would exceed, on a cumulative basis, an
amount equal to $2,600,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent
such Losses exceed the Deductible.

(iii) the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Sellers shall be liable
pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) (other than for a breach of a Fundamental
Representation) and Section 10.02(a)(iii) shall not exceed, in the aggregate,
$10,400,000 (the "General Cap").

(iv) the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Sellers shall be liable
pursuant to Section 10.02(a) shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $26,000,000
(the "Aggregate Cap").

For the avoidance of doubt, any payments made to Buyer Indemnitees from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds shall count towards (and effectively reduce) the
General Cap and the Aggregate Cap.

(c) For purposes of indemnification in this Article X, any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement (other than in the
first sentence of Section 5.07) shall be determined, and the calculation of
any Losses incurred in connection with such inaccuracy or breach shall be
made, without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty.

(d) From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations contained in this Article X), any indemnification or other claims
of the Buyer Indemnities will be asserted solely and exclusively against the
Indemnity Escrow Funds from time to time remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
Account pursuant to the terms of the Indemnification, Remediation and
Adjustment Escrow Agreement, and the Indemnity Escrow Funds remaining from
time to time in the Indemnity Escrow Account will be the Buyer Indemnities\'
sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to the Buyer
Indemnities hereunder; provided, however, that solely in the event of a claim
for indemnification (A) pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) in respect of a breach
of a

\- 36 -



Fundamental Representation or (B) pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(ii) or (C)
pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(iii) in respect of clause (i) of the definition
of "Specified Indemnifiable Liabilities" (such specific claims referred to in
clause (A), (B) and (C), the "Fundamental and Covenant Breach Claims"), the
Buyer may, in its discretion in lieu of asserting such Fundamental and
Covenant Breach Claim against the Indemnity Escrow Funds, seek indemnification
(subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Article X,
including, without limitation, in Section 10.02(b)(iv)) from the Sellers
directly on a several, and not joint and several, basis based on their
respective Indemnity Pro Rata Share of the underlying Loss with respect to
such Fundamental and Covenant Breach Claim (except with respect to the
Parthenon Sellers which shall be on a joint and several basis as among the
Parthenon Sellers) and such indemnity payments will be effected by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
by Buyer in writing. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as expressly provided by the proviso to
the proceeding sentence with respect to Fundamental and Covenant Breach
Claims, no claim by the Buyer Indemnities will be asserted against, and the
Buyer Indemnities will not be entitled to indemnification from, any Seller or
any of its Affiliates.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Sellers will have no obligation to indemnify any of the Buyer Indemnities from
and against any Taxes (or any other Losses directly related to Taxes) of any
Person (i) for any Post-Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any increase in Taxes for any Post-Closing Tax Period that may result
from any taxing authority adjustment related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that
reduces the amount of net operating loss carryforwards or net capital loss
carryforwards available in any Post-Closing Tax Period), or (ii) that are
attributable to (A) any transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the
Closing, (B) any taxable income or gain recognized by the Blocker, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that is attributable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the manner in which Buyer finances
such transactions), or (C) any breach of Section 10.09(b).

(f) All payments under this Section 10.02 will be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the proceeds received by the Sellers pursuant to Article I. The
parties agree that the Escrow Accounts will be treated as a contingent
installment obligation for United States federal and all applicable United
States state and local income Tax purposes, and that Buyer will be obligated
to report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow
Accounts as income of Buyer in the taxable year or years in which such income
is properly includible, and will be obligated to pay any Taxes attributable
thereto. Each of the parties will file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the foregoing.

10.03 Indemnification for the Benefit of the Seller Indemnitees. From and
after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this Article X), Buyer
will indemnify the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and agents (the "Seller Indemnitees") against and hold
them harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnitees
to the extent such Loss results from (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in Article VI of this Agreement,
(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer, or by Buyer as successor
to the Blocker or the Company contained in this Agreement requiring
performance by Buyer, the Blocker or the Company after the Closing, and (c)
actions taken by Buyer, or by Buyer as successor to the Blocker, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the Closing Date or relating to
the post-Closing operations of the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries.
All payments under this Section 10.03 will be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the proceeds received by the Sellers pursuant to Article I. Any
indemnification of the Sellers

|

\- 37 -



pursuant to this Section 10.03 will be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts and in the amounts
designated by the Representative in writing.

10.04 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement will terminate on the applicable survival termination
date (as set forth in Section 10.01), unless, with respect to a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that terminates following the
Closing Date, an Indemnified Party has incurred a Loss prior to such
applicable survival termination date and made a proper claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.02 or Section 10.03, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Article X (including application of Alternative
Arrangements as required by Section 10.07(a)), prior to such termination date,
as applicable, including by delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable
detail the amount of the Losses and details of and the method of computation
thereof, the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for
indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnified
Party has made a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article X
prior to such termination date, then such claim for such Loss incurred (after
giving effect to any reductions for Alternative Arrangements pursuant to
Section 10.07(a)), and only such claim for such modified Loss incurred, if
then unresolved, will not be extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set
forth in Section 10.01. For the avoidance of doubt, all claims by any Buyer
Indemnitee will immediately terminate (other than for any Fundamental and
Covenant Breach Claim) and expire as soon as the Indemnity Escrow Funds are
equal to zero dollars.

10.05 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a) In order for a party (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party
Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party (the
"Indemnifying Party") and the Representative (if the Indemnifying Party is a
Seller) in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as
promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis will not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party will have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will
promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the date on which the
Indemnifying Party received the notice delivered pursuant to Section 10.05(a)
to notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party desires to assume
the defense or prosecution of the Third-Party Claim and any litigation
resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such claim in accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying
Party shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof; (ii)
the Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party unless the judgment or settlement
provides solely for the payment of money, the Indemnifying Party makes such
payment (subject to the applicable limitations contained herein) and the
Indemnified Party receives an unconditional release of the applicable
Indemnified Party.


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 38 -



The Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall act in good faith in
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third-
Party Claims, and reasonably cooperate in any such defense and give each other
reasonable access to all information relevant thereto.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim within 30 days of receipt of the notice delivered pursuant to Section
10.05(a), the Indemnified Party will be entitled to assume such defense upon
delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party; provided,
however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of the Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense; (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying party informed on a current
basis of all developments and settlement offers and reasonably consult with
the Indemnifying Party regarding the defense of the Third-Party Claim, and
(iii) the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third-Party Claim without
first obtaining the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the failure of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Article X.

(d) The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its respective subsidiaries
to, provide reasonable cooperation with the Indemnifying Party in all aspects
of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise,
settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which an Indemnified Party
is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article X including, but not
limited to, by providing reasonable access to books, records, employees and
officers (including as witnesses). The Representative will act on behalf of
all Indemnifying Parties in the case of all Third-Party Claims with respect to
which Buyer is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 10.02 (with each
Seller responsible for its pro rata portion, based on such Seller\'s directly
or indirectly held Units immediately prior to Closing, of the
Representative\'s costs and expenses in undertaking such representation);
provided that the fees and expenses of the Representative may be reimbursed,
when and as incurred, from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, to the extent of
available funds.



10.06 Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. Each Indemnified Party will
use commercially reasonable efforts to address any Losses that may provide a
basis for an indemnifiable claim such that each Indemnified Party will respond
to any Losses in the same manner it would respond to such Losses in the
absence of the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. In the event that
an Indemnifying Party makes any payment to any Indemnified Party for
indemnification for which such Indemnified Party could have collected on a
claim against a third party (including under any contract and any insurance
claims), the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to pursue claims and conduct
litigation on behalf of such Indemnified Party and any of its successors, to
pursue and collect on any indemnification or other remedy available to such
Indemnified Party thereunder with respect to such claim and generally to be
subrogated to the rights of such Indemnified Party. Except pursuant to a
written settlement agreed to by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
will not waive or release any contractual right to recover from a third party
any Loss subject to indemnification hereby without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnified Party will, and will cause its Affiliates (including
the Blocker and the Company if the Blocker and the Company are Affiliates) to,
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense,
with respect to any such effort to pursue and collect with respect thereto.

10.07 Determination of Loss Amount.

(a) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under Section 10.02
and Section 10.03 will be calculated net of (i) the amount of any Tax Benefit
realized by an Indemnified Party by reason of such Loss or the circumstances
or adjustments giving rise thereto with respect to any taxable period in which
such Loss was incurred (or any earlier taxable period) but only to the extent
that an Indemnified Party utilizes such Tax Benefit and (ii) any amounts
recovered by any Indemnified Party or any of such Indemnified Party\'s
Affiliates under or pursuant to any insurance policy, title insurance policy,
indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or contract pursuant to or under which
such Indemnified Party or such Indemnified Party\'s Affiliates is a party or
has rights ("Alternative Arrangements"). For purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit"
means (x) any refund of Taxes paid, or (y) the amount the Indemnified Party\'s
hypothetical liability for Taxes for the taxable period, calculated by
excluding the relevant amount of credit, deduction, or Loss that would exceed
the Indemnified Party\'s actual liability for Taxes for such period,
calculated by taking into account the relevant amount of credit, deduction, or
Loss. The Indemnified Party will seek full recovery under all Alternative
Arrangements covering any Loss to the same extent as such Indemnified Party
would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event
that a recovery is made under an Alternative Arrangement by any Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss for which such Indemnified Party has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery will be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party.

(b) In no event will the Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as
applicable, be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect
of consequential, incidental or indirect damages, lost profits, diminution in
value or punitive damages (and, in particular, no "multiple of profits" or
"multiple of cash flow" or other valuation methodology will be used in
calculating the amount of any Losses), except to the extent the Buyer
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, are liable for such Losses
under a Third-Party Claim.

(c) No Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification under this
Article X to the extent (i) such matter was taken into account in determining
the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.02, or (ii) such matter was
reserved for in the Financial Statements.

10.08 Exclusive Remedy.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, the Buyer
Indemnitees\' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise related to the Blocker, the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses (other than a claim
for actual fraud directly against the Seller who committed such fraud against
the Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
will be for breach of contract only (as such contractual remedies have been
further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement)
and made pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Article X and the Buyer
Indemnitees will have no other remedy or recourse with respect to any of the
foregoing other than pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
Section 10.02. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer Indemnitees may
not avoid such limitation on liability by (i) seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, all of which are
hereby waived, or (ii) asserting or threatening any claim against any Person
that is not a party hereto (or a successor to a party hereto) for breaches of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement.

|

\- 40 -



(b) The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on Buyer\'s remedies with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including Section
10.02 and Section 10.03), were specifically bargained for between
sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to the Sellers hereunder.

10.09 Tax Matters.

(a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

(i) Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to be
timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Blocker, the Company and its
Subsidiaries that have not been filed as of the Closing Date. Buyer will
timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, any amount shown as due on such Tax
Returns. All such Tax Returns that are with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
will be prepared in a manner consistent with the past custom and practice of
the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required by
a change in applicable law. None of the Blocker, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will waive any carryback of any net operating loss, capital loss
or credit on any such Tax Return. At least 30 days prior to the date on which
each Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period is due, Buyer will
submit such Tax Return to the Representative to provide the Representative
with an opportunity to comment on such Tax Returns before filing.

(ii) With respect to the preparation of Tax Returns, Buyer and the Sellers
agree that all Transaction Tax Deductions will be treated as properly
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. Buyer will include all Transaction Tax Deductions in the Tax Returns of
the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
that ends on, or prior to, the Closing Date and will request a refund (rather
than a credit against future Taxes) with respect to any overpayment for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period. For the portion of the day of the Closing after the
time of Closing, other than the transactions expressly contemplated hereby,
Buyer will cause the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries to carry on
their business only in the ordinary course in the same manner as heretofore
conducted.

(b) Books and Records; Cooperation. Without limiting Section 10.10, Buyer and
the Representative will, and will cause their respective representatives to,
(i) provide the other party and its representatives with such assistance as
may be reasonably requested in connection with the review of any Tax Return,
including the filing of any claim for refund resulting from a carry back of a
Transaction Tax Deduction, or any audit or other examination by any taxing
authority or judicial or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes with
respect to the Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) retain
and provide the other party and its representatives with reasonable access to
all records or information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit,
examination or proceeding, provided that the foregoing will be done at the
expense of the party making such request and in a manner so as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the parties.

(c) Transfer Taxes. Buyer will pay, and will indemnify and hold the Sellers
harmless against, any real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, stock
transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the Blocker, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or any Seller as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties, interest
or additions to Tax with respect to the Transfer Taxes. Each Seller agrees to
cooperate with Buyer in


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 41 -



the filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including
promptly supplying any information in its possession that is reasonably
necessary to complete such returns.

(d) No Section 338 Election. Buyer will not make any election under Code
Section 338 (or any similar provision under state, local, or foreign law) with
respect to the acquisition of the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(e) Amended Tax Returns; Tax Elections. Buyer will not, without the
Representative\'s prior written consent (which consent may be withheld,
conditioned or delayed in the Representative\'s sole discretion) cause or
permit the Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) amend any
Tax Return that relates in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or
(ii) make any election that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

(f) Straddle Period Allocation. To the extent it is necessary for purposes of
this Agreement to determine the allocation of Taxes among a Straddle Period,
the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll
(including withholding Taxes) of the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing
of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such
purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass through entity in
which the Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial
interest will be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of other
Taxes of the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period
that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period.

(g) Non-Avoidance. Buyer will not take any action with respect to the Blocker,
the Company or its Subsidiaries that would cause the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or
substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described
in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

(h) Purchase Price Allocation. Within ninety (90) days following the date on
which the Statement becomes final, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the
Representative a Purchase Price Allocation to be used for purposes of applying
the provisions of Sections 751 and 755 of the Code to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Proposed Purchase Price Allocation"). The
Buyer shall prepare the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation in a manner
consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.755-1. Within thirty (30) days
of delivery of the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation, the Representative
shall notify the Buyer of any proposed changes. Buyer and the Representative
agree to discuss any proposed changes to the Proposed Purchase Price
Allocation and shall endeavor to agree on an allocation acceptable to the
parties, in each party\'s sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
no such agreement can be reached, the parties may allocate the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes as each party sees fit in its sole discretion.

10.10 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such requesting party\'s expense, any other party will
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.06 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto. No Seller may assign this Agreement to any of its
beneficial owners or successors, by operation of law or otherwise, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, without the consent of
Sellers, (i) assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any Affiliate thereof (including an assignment to one or more
Affiliates prior to Closing), provided that such Affiliate has sufficient
assets to fulfill Buyer's obligations under this Agreement and, at all times
prior to the Closing, Buyer remains liable for all such obligations, (ii) make
a collateral assignment

of any or all of its rights and interests under this Agreement to any lenders
or other financing source without releasing Buyer from its obligations
hereunder and (iii) assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to an acquirer of Buyer, whether by merger, sale of assets,
sale of equity, business combination, consolidation or otherwise.

12.07 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the
parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid provision that
gives effect to the intent of the parties to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law.

12.08 Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person. The
Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separately numbered sections corresponding to sections of this Agreement;
provided however, each section of the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to
incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any other section of the
Disclosure Schedules, in each case, if the relevance of such information to
such other section of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent on its
face. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise
defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the
ordinary course of business, and no party will use the fact of the setting of
the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included
in this Agreement or in any Disclosure Schedule or Exhibit is or is not
required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The information
contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of
law or breach of contract).

12.09 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Blocker, the Company and the
Representative; provided that (a) Section 8.03 will not be amended or waived
without the consent of a majority of the DandO Indemnified Persons and (b)
Section 12.01 will not be amended or waived without the consent of Parthenon.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof will
extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent
breach or default.

12.10 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
(including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement by,
between and among the parties and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by, between or among the parties, written or
oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. The
parties agree that prior drafts of this Agreement and the documents referred
to herein will be deemed not to provide any evidence as to the meaning of any
provision hereof or the intent of the parties with respect hereto and that
such drafts will be deemed joint work product of the parties. The parties
hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and
obligations respecting the sale and purchase of the Blocker and the Company
exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this
Agreement; and the parties hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any
duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge that this
Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties
derived from arm\'s-length negotiations; all parties to this Agreement
specifically acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with
another party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm\'s-length transaction. The sole and
exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein, made
in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) or
any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related to the sale
and purchase of the Blocker and the Company will be those remedies available
at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such contractual remedies
have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms of this
Agreement); and the parties hereby agree that neither party hereto will have
any remedies or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort) for any
statements, communications, disclosures, failures to disclose, representations
or warranties not set forth in this Agreement.



12.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission
in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
will constitute one and the same instrument.

12.12 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and
performed entirely within such State.

Person other than the parties to this Agreement and Parthenon and the DandO
Indemnified Persons any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or
with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

12.16 Representation of the Sellers and their Affiliates. Buyer agrees, on its
own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees, that, following the
Closing, Kirkland and Ellis LLP may serve as counsel to the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding any representation by Kirkland
and Ellis LLP prior to the Closing Date of the Blocker, the Company and/or any
of its Subsidiaries. Buyer, the Blocker and the Company (on behalf of itself
and its Subsidiaries) hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may have that
Kirkland and Ellis LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited
from engaging in such representation, and (b) agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, the Blocker, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any Seller or any of its Affiliates, Kirkland and
Ellis LLP may represent such Seller or Affiliate in such dispute even though
the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Blocker,
the Company or its Subsidiaries and even though Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have
represented the Blocker, the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. Buyer, the Blocker and the Company (on
behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) also further agree that, as to all
communications among Kirkland and Ellis LLP and the Blocker, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, and Sellers or Sellers\' Affiliates and representatives that
relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
the Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers and will not pass to or be
claimed by Buyer, the Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In
addition, if the Closing occurs, all of the client files and records in the
possession of Kirkland and Ellis LLP related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will continue to be property of (and be
controlled by) the Sellers, and none of the Blocker, the Company or its
Subsidiaries will retain any copies of such records or have any access to
them. Notwithstanding the


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 59 -



foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Blocker, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a third party other than a party to
this Agreement after the Closing, the Blocker, the Company and its
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Kirkland and Ellis LLP to such third party;
provided, however, that none of the Blocker, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Representative.

12.17 No Additional Representations; Disclaimer; Non-Recourse.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation and verification of the financial condition, results
of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, in making its determination to
proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer has relied
solely on the results of its own independent investigation and verification
and the representations and warranties of the Sellers, the Blocker and the
Company expressly and specifically set forth in Article III, Article IV and
Article V, respectively, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules. The
representations and warranties of the Sellers, the Blocker and the Company
expressly and specifically set forth in Article III, Article IV and Article V,
respectively, constitute the sole and exclusive representations, warranties,
and statements of any kind of any of the Sellers, the Blocker and the Company
(or any other Person) to Buyer in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and are the only representations, warranties, and
statements relied upon by Buyer, and Buyer understands, acknowledges and
agrees that all other representations, warranties, and statements of any kind
or nature expressed or implied (including any relating to the future or
historical financial condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or
liabilities of the Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the
quality, quantity or condition of the Blocker, the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' assets) are specifically disclaimed by the Sellers, the Blocker
and the Company and have not been relied upon. All representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and
subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth herein. BUYER
SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS, THE BLOCKER AND THE COMPANY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE
III, ARTICLE IV AND ARTICLE V, RESPECTIVELY, (X) BUYER IS ACQUIRING THE
BLOCKER AND THE COMPANY ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND (Y) NONE OF THE
SELLERS, THE BLOCKER, THE COMPANY OR ANY OTHER PERSON (INCLUDING ANY
STOCKHOLDER, MEMBER, OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF ANY OF THE
FOREGOING, WHETHER IN ANY INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE OR ANY OTHER CAPACITY) IS
MAKING, AND BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON, ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
INFORMATION, PROJECTION, ESTIMATION, FORECAST, PLAN OR OTHER STATEMENTS OR
INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO ANY MATTER CONCERNING THE BLOCKER, THE
COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION
PROVIDED TO (OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED BY) BUYER OR ANY OF BUYER\'S
REPRESENTATIVES.

(b) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or suit based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the
named parties to this Agreement and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to the named parties to this
Agreement. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement, including any
past, present or future director,


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 60 -



officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of the Blocker, the Company and the Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates, will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation (whether in contract or in tort) to
Buyer or any other Person resulting from (nor will Buyer have any claim with
respect to) (i) the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer\'s use of, or reliance on
(it being understood Buyer\'s reliance has been limited as set forth in this
Section 12.15), any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other
material made available to Buyer in certain "data rooms," confidential
information memoranda or management presentations in expectation of, or in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the sale and purchase of the
Blocker and the Company, including any alleged non-disclosure or
misrepresentations made by any such Persons, in each case, regardless of the
legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity,
or otherwise; and each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities
and obligations against any such Persons.

(c) In connection with the investigation by Buyer of the Blocker, the Company
and its Subsidiaries, Buyer has received or may receive from the Blocker, the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries certain projections, forward-looking
statements and other forecasts and certain forward-looking business plan
information. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans), and that Buyer will have no claim against
anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that none of the
Sellers, the Blocker, the Company or any member, officer, director, employee
or agent of any of the foregoing, whether in an individual, corporate or any
other capacity, makes any representation, warranty, or other statement with
respect to, and Buyer is not relying on, such estimates, projections,
forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and Buyer agrees that it has
not relied thereon.

12.18 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement will govern and control.

12.19 Specific Performance; Remedies.

(a) The parties hereto agree that the Buyer would suffer irreparable damage
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damages in the limited event that the Closing is not consummated
under the circumstances where the Buyer has complied with all of its
obligations under this Agreement (for the purposes hereof, such conditions
shall be deemed to be met if the Buyer has provided written notice to the
Company on or prior to the Outside Date certifying to the Sellers that Buyer
can comply with the conditions set forth in Section 2.03 and that Buyer is
ready and prepared to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by the Sellers, the Blocker or the Company
of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
Buyer, will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the breaching party, and


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 61 -



to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the breaching party under this Agreement. Sellers
hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy for Buyer of specific performance pursuant to this Section 12.19(a) to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and
hereby waive (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance by Buyer,
including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any
requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) The parties hereto agree that the Sellers would suffer irreparable damage
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damages in the limited event that the Closing is not consummated
under the circumstances where (i) the Sellers have complied with all their
respective obligations under this Agreement (and for purposes hereof, such
conditions shall be deemed to be met if the Sellers, the Blocker and the
Company have provided written notice to Buyer on or prior the Outside Date
certifying to Buyer that the Sellers, the Blocker and the Company can comply
with each of the conditions set forth in Section 2.02 (other than Section
2.02(f)) and that such parties are ready and prepared to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) all of the closing
conditions of Buyer have been met, other than Section 2.02(f), but that the
lenders are prepared to close on the transactions contemplated by the Sixth
Amendment. Accordingly and in such event, Representative, on behalf of
Sellers, will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by Buyer, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of Buyer under this Agreement. Buyer hereby agrees
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance pursuant to this Section 12.19(b) to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement. Buyer hereby waives (i) any
defenses in such an action for specific performance by the Sellers, including
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement
under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

12.20 Consents. Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts,
leases, licenses or other agreements to which the Blocker, the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party (including the contracts set forth on
Schedule 5.08(c) and Schedule 5.10(a)) and such consents have not been
obtained. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that the Sellers will have no
liability with respect to the consents set forth on Schedule 5.08(c) and
Schedule 5.10(a) (or any consent not required to be set forth on such
Schedules) to Buyer (and Buyer will not be entitled to assert any claims)
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain such consents that may
have been or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or termination of
any such contract, lease, license or other agreement as a result thereof.
Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of the Blocker or the Company contained herein will be breached or deemed
breached and no condition of Buyer will be deemed not to be satisfied as a
result of the failure to obtain any such consent or as a result of any such
default, acceleration or termination or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding
or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent or any such
default, acceleration or termination.

12.21 Electronic Delivery. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be treated
in all


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 62 -



manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto
will re‑execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties.
No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will raise the use of
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such
party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
related to lack of authenticity.

12.22 Buyer Deliveries. Any document or item will be deemed "delivered",
"provided" or "made available" within the meaning of this Agreement if such
document or item (a) is included in the electronic data room, (b) actually
delivered or provided to Buyer or any of its Representatives or (c) made
available upon request.

12.23 Appointment of the Representative.

(a) In order to administer efficiently the determination of the Estimated
Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price and the defense and/or settlement
of any claims for Losses, the Sellers, by their execution of this Agreement,
irrevocably appoint the Representative as their agent, attorney in fact and
representative (with full power of substitution in the premises), and, by its
execution hereof, the Representative hereby accepts such appointment.

(b) The Representative is hereby authorized (1) to take all action necessary
in connection with the acceptance, rejection and determination of the
Estimated Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price and the defense and/or
settlement of any claims for Losses (including the power to pursue claims
against Buyer, compromise any claim on behalf of the Sellers and to transact
matters of litigation, in each case pursuant to Article X), (2) to give and
receive all notices required to be given under this Agreement, the Deposit
Escrow Agreement, the Indemnification, Remediation and Adjustment Escrow
Agreement and any other agreements contemplated hereby to which all of the
Sellers are subject, and (3) to do or refrain from doing all such further acts
and things, and to execute all such documents as the Representative will deem
necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the power:

(i) to execute and deliver the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the
Indemnification, Remediation and Adjustment Escrow Agreement and any
amendments or waivers thereto as the representative of the Sellers; to execute
any instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent with respect to
disbursements or other matters thereunder; to pay any expenses of the Sellers
or the Representative from the Escrow Amount; and to take such further actions
under the Indemnification, Remediation and Adjustment Escrow Agreement and the
Deposit Escrow as the Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate;

(ii) to execute and deliver all consents, waivers, ancillary agreements, share
powers, certificates and documents that the Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) to execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement that
the Representative deems necessary or appropriate, whether prior to, at or
after the Closing;

(iv) to receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;


 

--- 
| | 

|

\- 63 -

 (v) to receive funds for the payment of expenses of the Sellers (including the
Representative Holdback Amount), to deposit such funds in such accounts as the
Representative deems appropriate and apply such funds in payment for such
expenses; and

(vi) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

(c) In the event that the Representative becomes unable to perform its
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the Sellers (or, if
applicable, their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns) who held, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power
represented by the Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to Closing,
will select another representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted
representative will be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of
this Agreement.

(d) Subject to the Representative complying in all material respects with the
terms of this Agreement, all instructions, decisions and actions by the
Representative, including the defense or settlement of any claims for Losses,
and including the distribution of amounts held in the Escrow Account, will be
binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller will have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same or otherwise have any cause of
action against the Representative for any action taken or not taken, decision
made or instruction given by the Representative under this Agreement.

(e) The Representative will promptly provide written notice to the Sellers
upon receiving service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement, and upon any settlement of such claims by the Representative.

(f) Buyer will be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions
of the Representative as to the determination of the Estimated Purchase Price
and the Final Purchase Price and the settlement of any claims for Losses and
the distribution of any amounts held in the Escrow Account and any other
actions required to be taken by the Representative hereunder, and no party
hereunder will have any cause of action against Buyer for any action taken by
Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Representative.

(g) The Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers
against all Losses paid or incurred in connection with any action, suit,
proceeding or claim to which the Representative is made a party by reason of
the fact that the Representative was acting as the Representative pursuant to
this Agreement; provided, however, that the Representative shall not be
entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent it is finally determined
in a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the
actions taken or not taken by the Representative constitute fraud, gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

(h) The Representative may use the Representative Holdback Amount in its sole
discretion to pay the expenses incurred by the Representative under the
authorization granted in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representative whether in respect of
indemnification claims, the defense thereof or otherwise.

(i) The provisions of this Section 12.23 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and will be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Seller may have in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (j) The provisions of this Section 12.23 will be binding upon the heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns of each Seller, and any references in
this Agreement to a Seller or the Sellers will mean and include the successors
to the rights of the Sellers hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary
disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 12.23,
no payment, notice, receipt or delivery of documents, exercise, enforcement or
waiver of rights or conditions, indemnification claim or indemnification or a
principal defense will be ineffective by reason only of it having been made or
given to or by a Seller, as the case may be, directly if each of the
Representative, Buyer and such Seller consent by virtue of not objecting to
such dealings without the intermediary of the Representative, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld.
