Section 1.3 Construction. Any reference in this Agreement to an "Article,"
"Section," "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refers to the corresponding Article,
Section, Exhibit or Schedule of or to this Agreement, unless the context
indicates otherwise. The table of contents and the headings of Articles and
Sections are provided for convenience only and are not intended to affect the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement. All words used in this
Agreement are to be construed to be of such gender or number as the
circumstances require. The words "including," "includes," or "include" are to
be read as listing non-exclusive examples of the matters referred to, whether
or not words such as "without limitation" or "but not limited to" are used in
each instance. Where this Agreement states that a party "shall," "will" or
"must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means that
the party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. As
used in this Agreement, "liability" means any liability or obligation,
including those resulting from any violation of Law, breach of Contract,
breach of warranty, tort or lawsuit, whether or not required to be reflected
on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with Spanish GAAP, but excluding the
executory portion of any Contract or Governmental Authorization (but not
excluding any liability with respect to any violation of Law or breach of
thereof). Any reference to a statute is deemed also to refer to any amendments
or successor legislation, and all regulations promulgated under or
implementing the statute, as in effect at the relevant time. Any reference to
a Contract or other document as of a given date means the Contract or other
document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time through such
date.

THE TRANSACTION

  

  

Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale of Shares. In accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers will sell and transfer to the

Section 2.2 Base Purchase Price and Payment. The Base Purchase Price shall be
paid as follows: €170,625,000 in D-R Shares (the "Consideration Shares") by
delivery of such shares to the accounts specified on Schedule I and
€204,868,000 in cash in Euros by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the accounts and in such allocated amounts as between the Sellers as
specified on Schedule I (together with the Consideration Shares, the "Closing
Consideration"); provided, that, the Sellers acknowledge that (i) €30,000,000
of the cash Closing Consideration will be paid into escrow pursuant to Section

immediately preceding March 1, 2011. The Consideration Shares will be valued

satisfied or waived on such date, on such later date as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than three Business Days after satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions, or at such other time and place as the Purchaser and the
Sellers (as represented by the Seller Representative) may agree in writing.
The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Closing Date."

   

  

(b) The parties agree that for convenience of preparing the Post-Closing
Balance Sheet they may desire to select a Closing Date at the end of a month
or such other date as they may mutually agree. Within 10 days of the proposed
Closing Date, the parties shall discuss whether a different date will be
needed (e.g., to ensure Closing is at month's end). If mutually agreed, such
date will be set and, if necessary, the Long-Stop Date extended for such
purpose.

-10-  

  

 

  

  

(d) If the Purchaser timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Seller
Representative, then the Purchaser and the Seller Representative will attempt
in good faith, for a period of 30 days, to agree on the Adjustment Calculation
for purposes of Section 2.6(h). Any written resolution by the Purchaser and
the Seller Representative during such 30-day period will be final and binding
on the parties for purposes of Section 2.6(h). If the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative do not resolve all items by the end of 30 days after the date
of delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative shall put such dispute before the Chief Executive
Officer of the Purchaser and the Seller Representative, who shall, for a
15-day period, attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the Chief
Executive Officer of the Purchaser and the Seller Representative do not
resolve such dispute by the end of the 15-day period, then the Purchaser and
the Seller Representative will submit the dispute to Deloitte for resolution
or, if that firm is unwilling or unable to serve, the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative will engage another mutually agreeable independent accounting
firm of recognized international standing, which firm is not the regular
auditing firm of the Purchaser or the Seller Representative (such selected
independent accounting firm, the "Independent Accounting Firm").

   

  

(e) The Purchaser and the Seller Representative will instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm to render its determination with respect to the dispute in a
written report that specifies the conclusions of the Independent Accounting
Firm as to the dispute and the resulting Adjustment Calculation. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall render its determination within 30 days
after referral of the dispute to such firm. The Independent Accounting Firm's
determination of the dispute with respect to the Adjustment Calculation as set
forth in its report will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of
Section 2.6(h). The Seller Representative will revise the calculation of the
final Post-Closing Net Debt as appropriate to reflect the resolution of the
issues in dispute pursuant to this Section 2.6(e). The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accounting Firm will be shared by the Purchaser, on one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the relative
amounts of the disputed amount determined to be for the account of the
Purchaser and the Sellers, respectively.

   

  

(f) If for any reason (i) the Independent Accounting Firm is unable to resolve
such a dispute or (ii) the Purchaser and the Seller Representative are unable
to jointly select the Independent Accounting Firm within 10 days after the
aggregate 45-day period referenced in Section 2.6(d), at the request of either
party the parties will submit the dispute to an expert to be appointed by the
President of the Commercial Court of Paris deciding in summary proceedings
(the "Expert"). The Expert shall act under the terms of Article 1592 of the
French Civil Code. The Expert shall issue a decision only on those disputed
items with respect to the Adjustment Calculation on which the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser have been unable to reach an agreement and
shall reach a conclusion as to each item in dispute the effect, if any, on the
resulting Adjustment Calculation. In carrying out its duties, the Expert shall
apply Spanish GAAP. The Expert shall render its decision within 30 days after
its appointment, which decision shall be final and binding upon the parties
for purposes of Section 2.6(h). The fees and expenses of the Expert will be
shared by the Purchaser, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, in
inverse proportion to the relative amounts of the disputed amount determined
to be for the account of the Purchaser and the Sellers, respectively.

   

  

(g) For purposes of complying with this Section 2.6, the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative will furnish to each other and to the Expert such work
papers and other documents and information relating to the dispute as the
Independent Accounting Firm or Expert may request and are available to that
party (or its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm or Expert any
material related to the disputed items and to discuss the items with the
Independent Accounting Firm or Expert. The Purchaser may require that the
Independent Accounting Firm or Expert enter into a customary form of
confidentiality agreement with respect to the work papers and other documents
and information relating to the Acquired Companies provided to the Independent
Accounting Firm or Expert pursuant to this Section 2.6.

    
 

 

 

 

  

 

-11-  

  

 

  

  

(h) If the Post-Closing Net Debt, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.6, is greater than the Net Debt, then the Seller Representative will
cause to be paid to the Purchaser the amount of such difference in cash plus
interest thereon (calculated based on the actual number of days elapsed in a
year consisting of 365 days) from the Closing Date through and including the
date of such payment at a rate of 4.00% per annum. If the Post-Closing Net
Debt, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.6, is less than the Net
Debt, then the Purchaser will pay to the Sellers the amount of such
difference in cash plus interest thereon (calculated based on the actual
number of days elapsed in a year consisting of 365 days) from the Closing Date
through and including the date of such payment at a rate of 4.00% per annum;
provided, however, that if the sum of the Items for Post-Closing Additional
Adjustment Calculation of Schedule III increase, an additional adjustment for
such increase will be made in favor of the Purchaser, but no adjustment will
be made in favor of the Sellers if the sum of the amounts decrease, and the
payment of any such additional adjustment shall be made to the Purchaser in
accordance with this Section 2.6.

   

  

(i) Any payment to a party pursuant this Section 2.6 will be effected by wire
transfer of immediately available funds from the payor to an account
designated by the payee. Such payments will be made within five Business Days
following the final determination of the Adjustment Calculation pursuant to
this Section 2.6 (with partial payment regarding any non-disputed amounts to
be made upon determination of such amounts).

  

  

(j) The purpose of this Section 2.6 is to determine the final Purchase Price
to be paid by the Purchaser under this Agreement. Accordingly, any adjustment
pursuant hereto will neither be deemed to be an indemnification pursuant to
Article 9 nor preclude the Purchaser from exercising any indemnification
rights pursuant to Article 9. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.6
will be treated by the parties for all purposes as an adjustment to the
Closing Consideration and will not be subject to offset for any reason. The
payment pursuant to this Section 2.6 will be applied to the Base Purchase
Price to be received by the Sellers in proportion to their respective holdings
of Shares as set forth on Schedule I. The Base Purchase Price as so adjusted
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Purchase Price."

following financial statements (collectively, the "Financial Statements"):

  

  

(i) audited consolidated and consolidating balance sheets of the Acquired
Companies as of the most recent prior three fiscal years (including the year-
ended December 31, 2010 to the extent available) (and the related audited
consolidated and consolidating statements of income, changes in shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years then ended, together with
the report thereon of PricewaterhouseCoopers, independent certified public
accountants);

  

  

(ii) unaudited consolidated balance sheet and profit and loss statement of the

(b) The Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) are correct and
complete, are consistent with and derived from the books and records of the
Acquired Companies and have been prepared in accordance with Spanish GAAP,

financial statements are subject to normal year-end adjustments, the effect of

of notes that, if presented, would not differ materially from the notes to the
Balance Sheet). The Financial Statements have not been rendered untrue,
incomplete or unfair as representations of the Acquired Companies by events
subsequent to the date of the Financial Statements, subject to any normal
year-end adjustments. The Financial Statements fairly present the financial
condition, results of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash
flows of the Acquired Companies as of the respective dates and for the periods
indicated therein. No financial statements of any Person other than the
Acquired Companies are required by Spanish GAAP to be included in the
financial statements of the Company. For purposes of this Section 3.5, the
representations and warranties regarding (i) the unaudited Financial
Statements as of December 31, 2010 shall be made only as of the Effective Date

taken by, the respective Acquired Company's shareholders and directors, and no
such meeting has been held for which minutes have not been prepared and are

Acquired Company shall be delivered to the Purchaser.

   

  

(b) All dividends and distributions declared, made or paid by any Acquired

(a) All notes and accounts receivable of the Acquired Companies are reflected
properly on the Balance Sheet and as of the Closing Date will only be

records of the Acquired Companies, and represent or will represent valid
obligations arising from sales actually made or services actually performed in
the Ordinary Course. Such notes and accounts receivable will as of the Closing
Date be current and, to the Sellers' Knowledge, collectible, net of the
respective reserve set forth in the corresponding line items on the Balance
Sheet or on the accounting records of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing
Date, as the case may be (which reserves have been calculated consistent with
the past custom and practice of the Acquired Companies). There is no contest,
claim, defense or right of setoff, other than returns in the Ordinary Course,
relating to the amount or validity of such note or account receivable.

raw materials and supplies, manufactured and purchased parts, goods in process

Ordinary Course and, with respect to finished goods, salable in the Ordinary
Course. None of such inventory is obsolete, except those covered by
depreciation losses (the provision for obsolescence for which is sufficient
and has been made in accordance with Spanish GAAP in a manner consistent with
previous years), defective or damaged. The values at which such inventories
are carried reflect the inventory valuation policy of the Company, which is in
accordance with Spanish GAAP. No Acquired Company has any commitments to
purchase inventory other than in the Ordinary Course.

Balance Sheet, each Acquired Company has conducted its business only in the
Ordinary Course and there has not been any Material Adverse Effect on the

terms;

  

  

(ii) each Acquired Company and, to the Sellers' Knowledge, the other parties

(iii) neither any Acquired Company nor, to the Sellers' Knowledge, any other
party to the Contract is in material breach or default under the Contract (or
other breach as a result of which any Acquired Company is not performing such

(d) To the Sellers' Knowledge, no director, executive officer or material

Section 3.15 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Each Acquired Company has timely filed all Tax Returns that it was
required to file in accordance with applicable Laws, and each such Tax Return
is accurate and complete in all material respects. Each Acquired Company has
timely paid all Taxes due with respect to the taxable periods covered by such
Tax Returns and all other Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax Return). Such
Tax Returns were prepared in a manner consistent with and utilizing the
accounting methods utilized in the preparation of the prior Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies. No claim has been made by a Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where an Acquired Company does not file a Tax Return that it is
or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. No Acquired Company has
requested an extension of time within which to file any Tax Return which has
not since been filed within the applicable extension period. The Acquired
Companies will make available to the Purchaser accurate and complete copies of
all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies (and their predecessors) for the
prior five Tax years for Brazil and four Tax years for all other countries.

   

  

(b) No Acquired Company has or will have additional liability for Taxes with
respect to any Tax Return which was required by applicable Laws to be filed on
or before the Closing Date, other than those reflected as liabilities in line
items on the Balance Sheet and on the Closing Balance Sheet. The amounts
reflected as liabilities in line items on the Balance Sheet and on the Closing
Balance Sheet for all Taxes are adequate to cover all unpaid liabilities for
all Taxes, whether or not disputed, that have accrued with respect to, or are
applicable to, the period ended on and including the relevant dates of such
balance sheets.

  

  

(c) All Taxes that each Acquired Company is required by Law to withhold or
collect, including sales and use Taxes and amounts required to be withheld or
collected in connection with any amount paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other Person, have been duly
withheld or collected. To the extent required by applicable Law, all such
amounts have been paid over to the proper Governmental Authority.

  

  

(d) To the Sellers' Knowledge, no federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits
or Tax Proceedings are pending or being conducted, nor has any Acquired
Company received any (i) notice from any Governmental Authority that any such
Tax audit or Tax Proceeding is pending, threatened or contemplated, (ii)
request for information related to Tax matters or (iii) notice of deficiency
or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted or assessed by
any Governmental Authority against any Acquired Company, with respect to any
Taxes due from or with respect to any Acquired Company or any Tax Return filed
by or with respect to any Acquired Company. No Acquired Company has granted or
been requested to grant any waiver of any statutes of limitations applicable
to any claim for Taxes or with respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency.
The Acquired Companies will make available to the Purchaser accurate and
complete copies of all examination reports and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by any Acquired Company since the last day of
the Tax year five years prior for Brazil and four Tax years prior for all
other countries.

   

  

(e) All Tax deficiencies that have been claimed, proposed or asserted in
writing against any Acquired Company have been fully paid or finally settled,
and no issue has been raised in writing in any examination which, by
application of similar principles, could be expected to result in the proposal
or assertion of a Tax deficiency for any other year not so examined.

  

  

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
no position has been taken on any Tax Return with respect to the business or
operations of any Acquired Company for a taxable period for which the statute
of limitations for the assessment of any Taxes with respect thereto has not
expired that is contrary to any publicly announced position of a taxing
authority or that is substantially similar to any position which a taxing
authority has successfully challenged in the course of an examination of a Tax
Return of any Acquired Company. Each Acquired Company has disclosed on its
federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to
an understatement of income.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-23-  

  

 

 

 

  

(g) No Acquired Company is a party to or bound by any Tax sharing agreement,
Tax allocation agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar Contract or
practice with respect to Taxes with related parties (including any advance
pricing agreement, closing agreement or other Contract relating to Taxes with
any Governmental Authority).

  

  

(h) No Acquired Company is or has been a member of a Tax consolidation group
within the meaning of Chapter VII of Section VII of the Spanish Corporate
Income Tax Act (Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004) (or any similar group defined
under a similar provision of foreign, state or local Law), other than a group
of which the Company is the common parent, and no Acquired Company has any
liability for Taxes of any other Person, as a transferee or successor, in
accordance with the provisions of articles 42.1 c) and 43.1 f) of Act 58/2003
(Ley General Tributaria) and or any similar or equivalent regulations
established in any other territory or jurisdiction that is applicable to the
Acquired Companies.

   

  

(i) No Acquired Company: (i) is a partner for Tax purposes with respect to any
joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement or Contract which is treated
as a "look through entity" for Tax purposes (entidad en atribucion de rentas
española o extranjera de acuerdo con lo establecido en el articulo 87.1 de la
Ley 35/2006, sin que a tales efectos computen como tales las Agrupaciones de
Interes Economicos y Uniones Temporales); or (ii) is a shareholder of a
"controlled foreign corporation" as defined in Chapter XI of Section VII
(Transparencia Fiscal Internacional) of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), except as set forth
in Section 3.15(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

   

  

(j) There are no Encumbrances upon any properties or assets of any Acquired
Company arising from any failure or alleged failure to pay any Tax (other than
statutory liens for current real or personal property Taxes not yet due and
payable and for which adequate reserves have been recorded in line items on
the Balance Sheet in accordance with Spanish GAAP or, since the date of the
Balance Sheet and through the Closing Date, adequate reserves have been
recorded in the Ordinary Course by the Acquired Companies).

  

  

(k) Each Acquired Company has complied in all material respects with all
transfer pricing requirements imposed by any Governmental Authority,
including, but not limited to, the use of an arm's length or similar amount
for related Person charges, and including mandatory Spanish transfer pricing
documentation, as required by Section 3 of Chapter V of Title I of Royal
Decree 1777/2004. No such authority has proposed a transfer pricing adjustment
or failure to comply with any transfer pricing requirements with the Sellers
and/or an Acquired Company. To the Sellers' Knowledge, no transfer pricing
adjustment could reasonably be expected to be proposed, asserted or raised by
any authority either before or after the Closing Date with respect to pre-
Closing activities, actions or omissions.

   

  

(l) No Acquired Company has granted a power of attorney that remains
outstanding with regard to any Tax matter.

  

  

Section 3.16 Employee Benefit Matters.

  

  

(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate
and complete list of all Company Plans. No Acquired Company has any Pension
Arrangement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-24-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Seller Representative has made available to the Purchaser an accurate
and complete copy of (i) each writing that sets forth the terms of each
Company Plan, (ii) all personnel, payroll and employment manuals and policies
of each Acquired Company, (iii) a written description of any Company Plan that
is not otherwise in writing, (iv) all insurance policies purchased by or to
provide benefits under any Company Plan, (v) all reports submitted since
January 1, 2008 by third-party administrators, actuaries, investment managers,
trustees, consultants or other independent contractors with respect to any
Company Plan and financial statements disclosing liability for all obligations
owed under any Company Plan, and (vi) all required filings with any
Governmental Authority in each of the most recent three plan years with
respect to each Company Plan, including all schedules thereto, financial
statements and the opinions of independent accountants.

   

  

(c) Except as required by applicable Law, no Acquired Company provides health
or welfare benefits for any retired or former employee, or their beneficiaries
or dependents, nor is any Acquired Company obligated to provide health or
welfare benefits to any active employee following such employee's retirement
or other termination of service.

  

  

(d) Each Company Plan is and at all times has been maintained, funded (to the
extent required by Law), financed, operated and administered, and each
Acquired Company has performed all of its obligations under each Company Plan,
in each case in accordance with the terms of such Company Plan and any
applicable agreement with any labor union, works council or other labor
organization and in compliance with all applicable Laws. All contributions
required to be made to any Company Plan by applicable Law and the terms of
such Company Plan, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Company Plan, for any period through the Closing Date,
have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be
made or paid on or before the Closing Date, will be fully reflected in line
items on the Post-Closing Balance Sheet. All returns, reports and filings
required by any Governmental Authority or which must be furnished to any
Person with respect to each Company Plan have been duly and timely filed or
furnished.

   

  

(e) Neither any Acquired Company nor any Seller has any liability to any
Governmental Authority with respect to any Company Plan of any Acquired
Company. There is no unfunded liability under any Company Plan based upon
reasonable actuarial standards applicable to the Company Plan. Other than
routine claims for benefits submitted by participants or beneficiaries, no
claim against, or Proceeding involving, any Company Plan or any fiduciary
thereof is pending or, to the Sellers' Knowledge, is threatened, which could
reasonably be expected to result in any liability, direct or indirect (by
indemnification or otherwise) of any Acquired Company to any Government
Authority or any other Person, and no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability.
No Proceeding has been concluded that resulted in any liability of any
Acquired Company that has not been fully discharged. No Contract with
Governmental Authority is being or has been negotiated with respect to any
Company Plan.

   

  

(f) Except as required by applicable Law, each Acquired Company has the right
to modify, amend and terminate benefits or any Company Plan with respect to
both retired and active employees without liability to any Acquired Company or
any Affiliate. No individual classified as a non-employee for purposes of
receiving employee benefits (such as an independent contractor, leased
employee, consultant or special consultant), regardless of treatment for other
purposes, is eligible to participate in or receive benefits under any Company
Plan. Each Company Plan sponsored by each Acquired Company permits assumption
thereof by the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries upon the Closing without the
consent of the participants or any other Person.

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

-25-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will not cause
accelerated vesting, payment or delivery of, or increase the amount or value
of any payment or benefit under or in connection with any Company Plan or
constitute a "deemed severance" or "deemed termination" under any Company Plan
otherwise with respect to, any director, officer, employee, or former
director, former officer or former employee of any Acquired Company (or any
other payment due to any change in control or severance event) and will not
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any Company Plan. No
Acquired Company has made or become obligated to make, and no Acquired
Company will as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement become obligated to "gross up" or otherwise compensate any
individual because of the imposition of any excise or additional Tax on such a
payment to the individual.

   

  

(h) Neither any Acquired Company nor any Affiliate has ever established,
maintained or contributed to, or had an obligation to maintain or contribute
to, for the benefit of any current or former U.S. director, officer, employee
or consultant of any Acquired Company or any Affiliate, a multiemployer plan
as defined under applicable U.S. Law.

gross annual remuneration, seniority, professional rank, job position, accrued
but unused sick and vacation leave or paid time off, social security
contribution and type of employment contract, and all collective bargaining,
works council, employee representative or other Contract with any labor union,
works council, or representative of any employee group. To the Sellers'
Knowledge, except as set forth on Section 3.17(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, there are no third party service providers that could reasonably
allege that they should be considered employees of any Acquired Company. To
the Sellers' Knowledge, no director, officer, key employee or group of
employees of any Acquired Company intends to terminate his, her or their
employment with any Acquired Company. The Acquired Companies comply in full in
all material respects with current applicable Law concerning employment and
Social Security. In particular, the Acquired Companies have hired their
employees in observance of all current applicable Law in all material
respects, have paid their remuneration and are in good standing in respect of
their obligations to the employees, and have complied in due time and form
with all their Tax obligations and obligations regarding Social Security
contributions relating to the employees in all material respects. To the
Sellers' Knowledge, and except as set forth in Section 3.17(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, there has been no union organizing, election or other
activities made or threatened at any time within the past three years by or on
behalf of any union, works council, employee representative or other labor
organization or group of employees with respect to any employees of any
Acquired Company except as required by applicable Law. There is no union,
works council, employee representative or other labor organization, which,
pursuant to applicable Law, must be notified, consulted or with which
negotiations need to be conducted in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

   

  

(b) Since January 1, 2008, and except as set forth in Section 3.17(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, no Acquired Company has experienced any labor
strike, picketing, slowdown, lockout, employee grievance process or other work
stoppage or labor dispute (other than those organized at a sectoral or
territorial level), nor to the Sellers' Knowledge is any such action
threatened. To the Sellers' Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, nor
does any Acquired Company contemplate a lockout of any employees.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-26-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Except as listed in Section 3.17(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,

applicable Laws and its own policies relating to labor and employment,
including but not limited to employee health and safety, wages, working hours,
collective bargaining, discrimination, employee classification, employee
termination (actual or constructive), and social security and other Taxes.
There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Sellers' Knowledge, threatened
against or affecting any Acquired Company relating to the alleged violation by
any Acquired Company (or its directors or officers) of any Law pertaining to
labor relations or employment matters. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Acquired Company has received written notice of the intent of any Governmental
Authority responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment Laws to
conduct an investigation with respect to or relating to any Acquired Company
and no such investigation is in progress.

   

  

(d) With respect to all employees who have been terminated or laid off, or
whose hours of work have been reduced by more than 50% by any Acquired
Company, since January 1, 2009, such actions were taken in accordance with
applicable Law and there are no pending or threatened claims with respect
thereto.

  

  

(e) To the Sellers' Knowledge, no Acquired Company employs any person whose
nationality is from a U.S. sanctioned country (Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea
or Sudan).

  

  

(f) All accruals for unpaid vacation pay, premiums for unemployment insurance,
health premiums, pension plan premiums or any other governmental fees or
charges relating to the employees of any Acquired Company, accrued wages,
salaries and commissions and employee benefit plan payments with respect to
employees of any Acquired Company have been accurately reflected in the
Company's books and records, as made available to Purchaser.

Property or other property or facility currently or previously owned, leased,
operated, controlled or otherwise used by any Acquired Company. No Acquired
Company has treated, stored, disposed of, arranged for or permitted the
disposal of, transported, handled, generated, manufactured, distributed,
exposed any Person to or released any substance, including any Hazardous
Material, or owned, operated or otherwise used any property or facility, in a

Health Law.

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

-27-

by operation of Law, assumed, undertaken, provided an indemnity with respect
to or otherwise become subject to any liability, including any obligation for

Environmental Law. To the Sellers' Knowledge, no event has occurred, or
circumstance or pre-existing condition exists, relating to the operations of,
or the properties or facilities (including any Owned Real Property and Leased
Real Property) currently owned, leased, operated, controlled or otherwise used
by any Acquired Company that could reasonably be expected to (i) prevent,
hinder or limit continued compliance in all material respects with any
Environmental Law or Occupational Safety and Health Law, (ii) give rise to any
investigatory, remedial or corrective obligations pursuant to any
Environmental Law or Occupational Safety and Health Law or (iii) give rise to
any other liability pursuant to any Environmental Law or Occupational Safety
and Health Law, including any liability relating to onsite or offsite releases
of, or exposure to, Hazardous Materials, personal injury, property damage or
natural resources damage.

years been in compliance in all material respects with any applicable Law,
Judgments and Governmental Authorizations (including Governmental
Authorizations from Other Governmental Persons) applicable to the Acquired
Companies or to the conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies or the
ownership or use of any of the Acquired Companies' properties or assets of the
Acquired Companies. No Acquired Company has received at any time in the last
five years any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
or any other Person regarding any actual, alleged or potential material
violation of, or failure to comply in any material respect with, any
applicable Law or Judgment or Governmental Authorization (including

Section 6.1(a).

   

  

(iii) To the extent any Governmental Authorizations require any amendments to
the Agreement, the parties shall conduct good faith negotiations to mutually
agree to any such amendments.

  

  

(c) With respect to any matter under Section 5.3(b), each of the Sellers and
the Purchaser shall promptly furnish the other party with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with preparation of filings, registrations or
submissions of information to any Governmental Authority.

  

  

(d) On or before the Closing Date, the Company will be in sole possession and
control of all original minute books, corporate seals and stock or equity

Section 5.4 Notification. Until the Closing, the Company and the Sellers will
give prompt notice to the Purchaser and the Purchaser to the Sellers of (a)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation
or warranty of the parties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate, in each case at any time from and after the Effective Date until
the Closing (including with respect to any information on the Seller
Disclosure Schedule), (b) any failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any party under this
Agreement and (c) the failure of any condition precedent to the respective
party's obligations under this Agreement.

Section 5.5 Exclusivity. Until the Closing, the Company and the Sellers will
not, and will cause the Acquired Companies and its and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees, agents, consultants
and other advisors and representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (a)
solicit, initiate, encourage, knowingly facilitate, or entertain any inquiry
or the making of any proposal or offer; (b) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations; (c) furnish to any Person any
non-public information or grant any Person access to its properties, assets,
books, Contracts, personnel or records; (d) approve or recommend, or propose
to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principal, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other Contract; or (e) propose, whether publicly or to any
director or shareholder, or agree to do any of the foregoing for the purpose
of encouraging or facilitating any proposal, offer, discussions or
negotiations; in each case relating to any business combination transaction
involving any Acquired Company or (except as permitted under this Agreement)
any other transaction to acquire all or any part of the business, properties
or assets of any Acquired Company or any amount of the capital stock of any
Acquired Company (whether or not outstanding), whether by merger, purchase of
assets, purchase of stock, tender offer, lease, license or otherwise, other
than with Dresser-Rand Group. The Company and the Sellers will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any such negotiations, discussion or other
communication, or Contracts (other than with Dresser-Rand Group) with respect
to the foregoing and will immediately cease providing and secure the return of
any non-public information and terminate any access of the type referenced in
clause (c) above. If any Acquired Company, any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees, agents,
consultants or other advisors and representatives receives, prior to the
Closing, any offer, proposal, request, inquiry or other contact, directly or
indirectly, of the type referenced in this Section 5.5, the Company or such
Seller, as applicable, will immediately suspend or cause to be suspended any
discussions with such offeror or Person with regard to such offers, proposals
or requests

   

  

Section 5.6 Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the parties agree to continue
to abide by the Non-Disclosure Agreement. From and after the Closing, the
confidentiality obligations of the Purchaser under the Non-Disclosure
Agreement will terminate with respect to all Evaluation Material. From the
Closing Date through the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, each Seller
will, and will cause each of its Affiliates and its and their respective
directors, officers, shareholders, employees, agents, consultants and other
advisors and representatives (its "Restricted Persons") to, maintain the
confidentiality of, and not use for their own benefit or the benefit of any
other Person, the Evaluation Material or other confidential information of the
Acquired Companies or Dresser-Rand Group and its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this
Agreement shall constitute an admission by Dresser-Rand Group that any
Evaluation Material or other confidential information in fact contains
material, non-public information of Dresser-Rand Group.

   

  

(b) Except as contemplated by Section 5.8, neither the Purchaser nor any
Seller will, and the Purchaser and each Seller will cause each of their
respective Restricted Persons not to, disclose to any Person any information
with respect to the legal, financial or other terms or conditions of this
Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The foregoing does not restrict the right of
any party to disclose such information (i) to its respective Restricted
Persons to the extent reasonably required to facilitate the negotiation,
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, (ii) to any Governmental Authority or arbitrator to the extent
reasonably required in connection with any Proceeding relating to the
enforcement of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (iii) in compliance
with an action or Judgment of a Governmental Authority or as required under
applicable Law and (iv) as permitted in accordance with Section 5.6(c). Each
party will advise its respective Restricted Persons with respect to the
confidentiality obligations under this Section 5.6(b) and will be responsible
for any breach or violation of such obligations by its Restricted Persons.

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

-38-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If a party or any of its respective Restricted Persons become legally
compelled to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise restricted by
this Agreement, then such party will (i) give the other party immediate
written notice of such requirement, and (ii) consult with and use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the other party in obtaining an injunction or
other appropriate remedy to prevent such disclosure.

  

  

(d) Effective upon the Closing, the Sellers hereby assign to the Purchaser all
of their rights under each confidentiality agreement (other than the Non-
Disclosure Agreement) to which any of the Sellers is a party and which pertain
to the business or operations of any Acquired Company. Each Seller, upon the
request of the Purchaser from time to time, will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the Purchaser in enforcing the provisions of any
such confidentiality agreement.

  

  

Section 5.7 Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation. The Sellers acknowledge that:
(a) the Acquired Companies have devoted substantial time, effort and resources
to developing the Acquired Companies' trade secrets and other confidential and
proprietary information as well as the Acquired Companies' relationships with
customers, suppliers, employees and others doing business with the Acquired
Companies; (b) that such relationships, trade secrets and other information
are vital to the successful conduct of the Acquired Companies' businesses in
the future; (c) that because of the Sellers' access to the Acquired
Companies' confidential information and trade secrets, the Sellers would be in
a unique position to divert business from the Acquired Companies and to commit
irreparable damage to the Acquired Companies were the Sellers to be allowed to
compete with the Acquired Companies or to commit any of the other acts
prohibited below; that the enforcement of the restrictive covenants against
the Sellers would not impose any undue burden upon any Seller; and (d) that
the ability to enforce the restrictive covenants against the Sellers is a
material inducement to the decision of the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of such
date (the "Restricted Period"):

   

  

(a) no Seller will, directly or indirectly, engage in any business anywhere in
the world that develops, manufactures, produces, markets, sells or distributes
any products or provides any services of the kind developed, under
development, manufactured, produced, marketed, sold, distributed or provided
by the Acquired Companies as of the Closing, or own an interest in, manage,
operate, join, control or render financial or other assistance to, be employed
by, or participate in or be connected with, as a partner, shareholder,
consultant or otherwise, any Person that engages in the business of, or
competes with the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies in, developing,
manufacturing, producing, marketing, selling or distributing any products or
providing any services of the kind developed, under development, manufactured,
produced, marketed, sold, distributed or provided by the Acquired Companies as
of the Closing; provided, however, that, for the purposes of this Section 5.7,
ownership of securities having no more than 5% of the outstanding voting power
of any Person which are listed on any national securities exchange will not be
deemed to be in violation of this Section 5.7 as long as the Person owning
such securities has no other connection or relationship with such Person. The
Restricted Period will be extended by the length of any period during which
the Seller is in breach of the terms of this Section 5.7(a);

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

-39-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) no Seller will directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in
conjunction with any other Person, (i) call upon any employee who is, at the
time the individual is called upon, an employee of Dresser-Rand Group or any
of its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company) for the purpose or with
the intent of soliciting such employee away from or out of the employ of
Dresser-Rand Group or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired
Company), or employ or offer employment to any individual who was or is
employed by Dresser-Rand Group or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
Acquired Company) unless such individual will have ceased to be employed by
Dresser-Rand Group or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company)
for a period of at least six months prior thereto or (ii) cause, induce or
attempt to cause or induce any customer, strategic partner, supplier,
distributor, landlord or others doing business with Dresser-Rand Group or any
of its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company) Company to cease or
reduce the extent of its business relationship with Dresser-Rand Group or any
of its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company) Company or to deal with
any competitor of Dresser-Rand Group or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
Acquired Company); provided, however, that this Section 5.7(b) will not be
deemed to prohibit the Seller from engaging in general media advertising or
solicitation that may be targeted to a particular geographic or technical area
but that is not targeted towards employees of Dresser-Rand Group or any of
its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company); and

   

  

(c) no Seller will disparage Dresser-Rand Group, the Acquired Companies or any
of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, this provision shall not be interpreted as
limiting the ability of the Sellers set forth on Section 5.7 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule to acquire ownership of a minority interest in any company
that manufactures products or provides services similar to those developed by
the Acquired Companies (to the extent they are passive investors and do not
actively participate in the management of the company, it being understood
that a minority (non-executive) membership in the Board will not qualify as
such) or to the activities listed in Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

  

  

Section 5.8 Public Announcements. Any public announcement or similar publicity
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be issued at such time and in such manner as the Purchaser
agrees with the Seller Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall restrict any party from making any such disclosure required by
applicable Law or stock exchange rules, provided that such party shall notify
each other party not fewer than three Business Days, if possible (but in any
event as soon as possible), prior to any such disclosure. The Purchaser and
the Seller Representative will consult with each other concerning the means by
which the employees, customers, suppliers and others having dealings with the
Acquired Companies will be informed of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Purchaser has the right to participate in any such
communication.

   

  

Section 5.9 Governance and Integration.

  

  

(a) As of the Closing Date, the board of directors of Dresser-Rand Group shall
appoint Joseba Grajales as an Advisory Director of Dresser-Rand Group.

  

  

(b) Following the Closing Date, Joseba Grajales shall be entitled to
participate in Dresser-Rand Group's Long Range Strategic Planning and Annual
Operating Planning Process and Mr. Jon Azua or the incumbent Senior Business
Leader of the Company (the "Business Leader") will participate in Dresser-Rand
Group's Executive Leadership Team.

  

  

(c) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Dresser-Rand Group and
the Company shall procure that a dedicated team be constituted as a "synergy
committee," based in Spain, will work together to execute the synergy plan as
their priority. Such committee shall be composed of an equal number of
representatives of Dresser-Rand Group employees and Company employees (with
such number to be agreed between the Purchaser and the Seller Representative)
and shall include and be co-chaired by Joseba Grajales and Vincent R. Volpe
Jr.

  

  

(d) The Business Leader shall report to Mr. Chris Rossi and the person who
heads the sales and marketing departments of the Company would have a dual
reporting relationship with Mr. Marco Rossi, for the day to day order capture
function, and an ongoing relationship with the Business Leader, as part of the
local leadership team of which he is presently a part. The Business Leader and
the existing management team will be responsible for executing the Company's
three year strategic plan.

Section 5.10 Small Engines Business. Prior to the Closing, the parties shall
agree the method and manner by which the small engines business shall be
contributed at no cost to the Company or an Acquired Company (including the
related Intellectual Property). The small engines business relates to the
engineering and production expertise to manufacture the diesel and gas engines
that were previously manufactured under the brand name "Pertrak." These
engines range from 25 to 135 kW and they can run both on diesel and gas. This
business' intent is to develop a "Low Power" engine family based on the
product bought from "Pertrak," together with manufacturing the engines as they
currently are in the shorter term.

   

  

Section 5.11 Further Assurances. Subject to the other express provisions of
this Agreement, the parties will cooperate reasonably with each other and with
their respective representatives in connection with any steps required to be
taken as part of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and the
parties agree (a) to furnish, or cause to be furnished, upon request to each
other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, to each other such other documents and (c) to do, or
cause to be done, such other acts and things, all as the requesting party
may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
the parties will cooperate reasonably with each other and with their
respective representatives in connection with the Acquired Companies'
integration with and into the Dresser-Rand group, including, but not limited
to, for purposes of Dresser-Rand Group's financial reporting and other
disclosure and governance obligations under applicable Law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 5.11 shall not include any additional Due
Diligence requests.

   

  

Section 5.12 Tax Conduct. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement
or as consented to in writing by Dresser-Rand Group, the Sellers shall not,
and shall not permit any Acquired Company to, do any of the following (except
as may be required by Law):

  

  

(a) make or rescind any express or deemed election relating to Taxes with
respect to an Acquired Company;

  

  

(b) settle or compromise any Proceeding, audit or controversy relating to
Taxes of an Acquired Company;

  

  

(c) file a material amendment to any Tax Return related to an Acquired
Company;

  

  

(d) Consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to
any Tax claim or assessment of an Acquired Company; or

  

  

(e) change in any respect any Acquired Company's method of reporting any item
for Tax purposes.

  

  

Section 5.13 Adjustment of Consideration Shares. If applicable between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date, the number of Consideration Shares shall
be adjusted as appropriate to reflect any dividend, stock split or reverse
stock split, recapitalization, merger, reorganization, reclassification,
spinoff or other change in the capital structure affecting the D-R Shares and
not involving the receipt of consideration by Dresser-Rand Group effected
after the Effective Date, with such adjustment to be made in the same manner
as for other shareholders of Dresser-Rand Group resulting from such change in
capital structure. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not apply
to any stock repurchases.

Section 5.14 Financial Arrangements.

  

  

(a) The parties will cooperate reasonably with each other and with their
respective representatives in order to coordinate with reasonable advance
notice in connection with (determined by the Purchaser) obtaining any Consents
to, or cancelling, any of the third party financial agreements listed in
Section 3.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, including, but not limited
to, removing or releasing any related applicable Encumbrances on the Shares or
properties or assets of the Acquired Companies. The Purchaser shall extend
such funds as may be required in order to satisfy the financial requirements
of the Acquired Companies as a result of any such foregoing actions on or
before Closing.

  

  

(b) The parties acknowledge Fespyme's intention to exercise its put option to
sell the shares held in Guascor Wind, S.L. (an Acquired Company) prior to the
Closing pursuant to the agreement ("escritura de contrato de toma de
participacion en Guascor Wind, S.L. y pactos entre socios") executed on June
30, 2008, as amended on June 29, 2010. In particular, on or prior to the
Closing, the Company undertakes to acquire from Fespyme Fondo de Capital
Riesgo ("Fespyme"), which undertakes to sell, all of the shares owned by
Fespyme in Guascor Wind, S.L. (currently 125,824 shares) for an aggregate
price to be paid in cash at the time of the transfer that equals an internal
rate of return (IRR) of 13% for the Fespyme investment in Guascor Wind, S.L.,
provided that the Sellers will be responsible for paying any amounts above the
corresponding Net Debt items reflected in Schedule III. This transaction,
pursuant to the terms and conditions described above, is an agreed exception
to any general statement contained under Section 3 and/or 5 that would
otherwise prohibit such transaction and, therefore, in no event shall be
construed as a breach of this Agreement in that regard.

   

  

Section 5.15 Exclusion of Guascor Foton AGF, S.L. and Guascor Foton, S.L. from
the Transaction.

  


 

  

(a) The Company owns Guascor Solar Corporation, S.A.U., which directly owns
100% of Guascor Foton AGF, S.L. ("Foton") (together with Foton's owned-
subsidiary, Guascor Foton, S.L., collectively, the "Foton Companies"), and the
parties have agreed to exclude these Subsidiaries from the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Foton Companies are parties to the arbitration
Proceedings set forth on Section 5.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(b) Prior to Closing, the Company shall cause Guascor Solar Corporation,
S.A.U. to sell to the Sellers all outstanding shares of Foton for €1\. The
Sellers will purchase and acquire the shares in Foton in proportion to their
percentage of ownership interest in the Shares, unless they mutually agree to
a different distribution (including any Seller not becoming a Foton
shareholder). The Sellers represent and warrant that all assets, personnel,
Contracts, Intellectual Property and other property necessary for the Foton
Companies to conduct their business are owned or held solely and exclusively
by such companies. Except as set forth on Section 5.15(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, there are no Contracts or accounts receivable
or accounts payable or other financial arrangements (including intercompany
arrangements or financial commitments) or obligations between the Foton
Companies, on the one hand, and any Acquired Companies, on the other hand,
currently in place. Prior to Closing, the Company shall ensure that all
arrangements described on Section 5.15(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
shall be terminated or closed-out in accordance with applicable Law and
without creating any Tax, liability or other Loss for the Company or any of
the other Subsidiaries. The Sellers shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses incurred in such sale and the termination of such arrangements.

   

  

(c) As a result of the exclusion of these Subsidiaries from the transaction,
an amount equal to €11,527,000 was excluded from the determination of Net Debt
as the Sellers represent and warrant that €11,527,000 is the amount of Net
Debt attributable to the Foton Companies as of October 31, 2010.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-42-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Prior to the Closing:

  

  

(i) the Foton Companies will ensure that (A) their respective corporate names
will be changed, therefore removing all mention of "GUASCOR," (B) current
directors will be removed and new directors will be appointed and (C) any
trade mark or distinctive sign that makes reference or relates to "GUASCOR"
will be transferred to the Company; and

  


 

  

(ii) the Parties will agree on the interim information technology services
that the Company will provide the Foton Companies for a period of 90 days
following Closing, all at the sole cost and expense of the Foton Companies, on
market terms mutually acceptable to the Foton Companies and the Purchaser.

  


 

  

(e) The Sellers and the Foton Companies agree and undertake that once Foton is
sold to the Sellers, the commercial activities of the Foton Companies shall be
limited at all times to those which are strictly necessary to fully meet their
contractual obligations under the Contracts set forth on Section 5.15(e) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which they assumed with regard to the already
installed photovoltaic facilities (the "Permitted Activities"). Further and
not by way of limitation of the prior sentence, each of the Foton Companies
agrees to be bound in writing to the provisions of Section 5.7 as if they
were Sellers under this Agreement, other than as it relates to the Permitted
Activities.

   

  

(f) Beginning on January 1, 2014, and until the 10th anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Purchaser or its designee shall have a right to purchase the
entirety of the Foton Companies upon written notice to the Sellers.

  

  

(i) The closing of the sale shall take place on a date designated by the
Purchaser within 45 days from the date of the notice. The purchase price of
the shares covered by the option shall in all cases be €1, to be paid upon the
formalization of the transfer of the shares. If during the period of the
ownership of the Foton Companies by the Sellers, the Sellers make investments
in the Foton Companies in furtherance of the Permitted Activities (either
through debt or capital contributions to the equity of the Foton Companies)
and (i) such amounts have been expended by the Foton Companies for legitimate
business purposes and (ii) not been repaid to the Sellers as of the closing of
the transfer back to the Company, then:

  


 

  

(A) there shall be added to the €1 purchase price the amount of unrepaid
capital contributions; provided, however, this Section 5.15(f)(i)(A) shall not
be applicable if the Foton Companies have engaged in any activities other than
Permitted Activities without Purchaser's consent; and

  


 

  

(B) the Purchaser, at its election, shall leave the debt in place at the Foton
Companies or arrange for its repayment at the closing of the transfer back to
the Company. The Sellers shall provide the Purchaser reasonably requested
information regarding the debt and capital contributions, as well as provide
the Purchaser regular updates regarding the status of the arbitration
Proceeding and the business of the Foton Companies (including financial
statements).

  


 

  

(ii) The notary before whom the transfer should be executed shall be selected
by the Company from among those practicing in the City of Bilbao or the city
of Vitoria-Gasteiz. All costs and Taxes deriving from the formalization of the
transfer shall be the expense of the Sellers. The deed for formalization of
the transfer of equity shares shall include a clause on "Representations and
Warranties of the Sellers" and one on "Indemnification" similar to those
envisaged in Articles 3 and 9.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-43-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) The Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from any claim (including Losses), regardless of the
nature thereof, that may be brought against them deriving from the transfer of
the Foton Companies to the Sellers (or their ownership by the Sellers) and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation any
violation of Section 5.7 or the prior paragraph, as well as any transfer of
the Foton Companies back to the Company under Section 5.15(f). Such indemnity
shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 9, although
the limitations on liability established in Section 9.6(c) shall not be
applicable thereto.

   

  

(h) If the arbitral proceeding to which mention was made in Section 5.15(a)
results in a Contract or an award that entails the collection by the Foton
Companies of indemnity or financial compensation ("Indemnity Deriving from
Arbitration"), such amount shall be allocated to the Foton Companies and used
solely for the operation and financial requirements of the Foton Companies.
Such amounts corresponding to the Indemnity Deriving from Arbitration may in
no case be distributed to the Sellers, totally or partially, whether in the
form of a dividend, capital decrease, or any other means of the distribution
of profits or contributions; nor may it be used to perform returns of loans,
credits or contributions of any other type made by them to the Foton Companies
or to pay interest on such loans, credits or contributions. If the Sellers or
the Foton Companies collect, in any capacity, any quantity from the amount
corresponding to the Indemnity Deriving from Arbitration, they unconditionally
and irrevocably undertake to pay the Company an amount equal to the one
collected by them within 10 days of their collection thereof.

   

  

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, other than in conjunction with the call
option, the Sellers shall not sell, transfer or encumber the shares of the
Foton Companies prior to the expiration of the 10-year period following the
Closing Date, to any third Person (other than the Sellers). This commitment
will not limit the Sellers ability to take any action expressly required under
applicable Law.

  

  

Section 5.16 Sale of Certain Entities. Section 5.16 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth any legal formalities to be completed on or before the
Closing Date with respect to the sales of shares of Subsidiaries of the
Company with respect to the solar farms in the solar development to Centauro
Capital, S.L.U. and, prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the
Purchaser reasonably satisfactory evidence of the execute of a public deed
before a Spanish notary public regarding the completion of such sales and/or
such other documentation as may be required under applicable Law regarding
the completion of such sales.

   

  

Section 5.17 Rule 144. For a period of at least 12 months following the
Closing Date, Dresser-Rand Group will use its reasonable best efforts (a) to
timely file all reports required to be filed by Dresser-Rand Group after the
date hereof under the Exchange Act (including the reports pursuant to Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule
144) and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, and (b) if
Dresser-Rand Group is not required to file reports pursuant to such sections,
it will prepare and furnish to the Sellers and make publicly available in
accordance with Rule 144(c) such information as is required for the Sellers to
sell Consideration Shares under Rule 144, all to the extent required from time
to time to enable the Sellers to sell Consideration Shares without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144.

   

  

Section 5.18 Management Release. No individual or entity serving as a director
or officer of any Acquired Company who has (a) served in such position prior
to Closing and (b) a direct or indirect ownership interest in any Seller or
has been appointed on behalf of such Seller (each, a "Member of Management")
shall be liable for any Losses which arise out of such Person acting in his
official capacity as such Member of Management on or prior to Closing
(each, a "Covered Matter"); provided, however, that this limitation on
liability for a Member of Management shall not apply to any matters arising
out of such Member of Management's fraud or willful misconduct. The parties
agree that each Member of Management is an express third party beneficiary of
this covenant only. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.18
is intended to limit any Purchaser Indemnified Parties\' indemnification
rights under this Agreement for breaches or defaults of representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements and no Seller (as opposed to any
Member of Management) shall use this  Section 5.18 as a defense against any
claims under Article 9.

(e) by the Sellers as represented by the Seller Representative (so long as the

breach or default of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, as set forth above under Sections
7.1(b)-(e), as applicable), or the OFAC Government Authorizations have not

yet been obtained, but in no event more than 120 days from the Effective Date.

   

  

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1, this Agreement and all rights and obligations of the parties
under this Agreement automatically end without liability against any party or
its Affiliates, except that (a) Section 5.6 (Confidentiality),  Section 5.8
(Public Announcements), Article 10 (General Provisions) (except for Section
10.12 (Specific Performance)) and this Section 7.2 will remain in full force
and survive any termination of this Agreement and (b) if this Agreement is
terminated by a party because of the breach of this Agreement by another party
or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating party's
obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other
party's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the
terminating party's right to pursue all legal remedies will survive
such termination unimpaired. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (b) will only
apply to breaches which are attributable to such party, or under the control
of such party, but not for any third party acts or omissions.

ARTICLE 8

  

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

  

  

Section 8.1 Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) The Purchaser will prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed)
all Tax Returns with the respect to the Acquired Companies that are due after
the Closing Date. The Purchaser will deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the
Seller Representative a draft of any Tax Return prepared (or caused to be
prepared) by the Purchaser not less than 30 days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return, but only to the extent such Tax Return could affect
Taxes for which the Sellers are liable under this Agreement. The Seller
Representative will provide the Seller with its comments on, and proposed
changes to, such Tax Return not later than 20 days prior to such due date. If
any material aspect of any such Tax Return remains in dispute within 15 days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, the matter in dispute will
be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. The decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm will be final and binding on the parties. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be shared by the
Purchaser, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, in inverse
proportion to the relative amounts of the disputed amount determined to be for
the account of the Purchaser and the Sellers, respectively. Upon resolution of
all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be timely filed on that basis,
provided, however, that if after using reasonable best efforts, the parties
are unable to resolve the matter in dispute before any Tax Return that is the
subject of a disagreement is due, such Tax Return may be filed as prepared
(or caused to be prepared) by the Purchaser, subject to adjustment or
amendment upon resolution, and the making of any payments necessary to give
effect to the resolution. The Sellers shall pay the Purchaser the amount of
any Taxes for which the Sellers are liable under this Agreement that are due
with respect to such a Tax Return no later than five days before the due date
of such Tax Return.

   

  

Section 8.2 Payment of Taxes. To the extent that Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for all taxable periods and portions of periods through the Closing
Date (including all such Taxes payable with respect to Tax Returns filed under
this Article 8 and any Taxes assessed after the Closing with respect to
taxable periods or portions of periods through the Closing Date) are accrued
or expressly reserved for as current liabilities in line items on the Balance
Sheet or are accrued or expressly reserved by the Acquired Companies during
the Post-Balance Sheet Period in the Ordinary Course the Purchaser will pay or
cause to be paid such Taxes. To the extent such Taxes for all taxable periods
and portions of periods through the Closing Date are not so reflected as
current liabilities on the Balance Sheet or are not accrued or expressly
reserved by the Acquired Companies during the Post-Balance Sheet Period in the
Ordinary Course, the Sellers will pay all such Taxes. Taxes that are payable
with respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date will be allocated to the portion of the period that
ends on the Closing Date in accordance with Section 8.3.

   

  

Section 8.3 Tax Apportionment. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after
the Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion
of the period ending on the Closing Date will be:

  

  

(a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than
any transaction Taxes contemplated by Section 8.4), deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the taxable period ended as of the close of business
on the Closing Date; and

  

  

(b) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of the Acquired Companies, or otherwise measured by the level of any
item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-47-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.4 Transactional Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, all transfer, documentary, recording, notarial, sales, use,
registration, stamp and other similar Taxes or fees imposed by any Taxing
authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be borne by the Purchaser, the Company and/or the Sellers in accordance
with applicable Law; provided, however , that real estate transfer Taxes
(RETT) imposed by any Taxing authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be borne by the Sellers. The Sellers will,
at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, the
Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns or other documentation. The Sellers will deliver to the
Purchaser a draft of any such Tax Return prepared by the Sellers not less than
30 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return. The Purchaser will
provide the Seller Representative with its comments on, and proposed changes
to, such Tax Return not later than 20 days prior to such due date. If any
material aspect of any such Tax Return remains in dispute within 15 days prior
to the due date for filing such Tax Return, the matter in dispute will be
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to the process
referenced in Section 8.1.

   

  

Section 8.5 Maintenance of Tax Consolidating Group. The Sellers shall not be
liable for any Loss relating to the loss of the special tax consolidating
regime of the group whose holding is the Company. For the avoidance of doubt,
this exemption of liability will not affect the liability of Sellers for
Losses arising from any action taken by the Purchaser post-Closing that may
result in such loss of the special tax consolidating regime of the group whose
holding is the Company, except to the extent the Loss arises from a pre-
Closing intercompany transaction between members of the special tax
consolidating regime of the group whose holding is the Company that was not
properly reflected on the Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies. In any event,
and within the five-year period following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the Seller
Representative before any such action and consider the possible advantages in
maintaining such tax consolidations group.

(h) any Proceedings, demands or assessments related to any of the matters set
forth in clauses (a) through (g) above.

hold harmless the Sellers and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives from and against, and will pay to the Sellers all

Section 9.3 Claim Procedure.

  

  

(a) A party that seeks indemnity under this Article 9 (an "Indemnified Party")
will give written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the party from whom
indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") containing (i) a
description and, if known, the estimated amount of any Losses incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a reasonable
explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the facts then
known by the Indemnified Party and (iii) a demand for payment of those
Losses.

   

  

(b) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
will deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response in which the
Indemnifying Party will either:

  

  

(i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Losses
at issue in the Claim Notice; or

  

  

(ii) dispute the Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification by
delivering to the Indemnified Party a written notice (an "Objection Notice")
setting forth in reasonable detail each disputed item, the basis for each such
disputed item and certifying that all such disputed items are being disputed
in good faith.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party fails to take either of the foregoing actions
within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party
will be deemed to have refused the Claim Notice.

  

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection Notice or fails to notify
the acceptance of the Claim Notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days
after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the dispute may be resolved by any
legally available means consistent with the provisions of Section 10.11.

  

  

Section 9.4 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) Without limiting the general application of the other provisions of this
Article 9, if another Person not a party to this Agreement claims or alleges
facts that, if true, would mean that a party is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, the party so entitled to indemnity for those claims,
allegations and demands and related Losses under and pursuant to this Article
9. If the Indemnified Party seeks indemnity under this Article 9 in respect
of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand, whether or not involving a
Proceeding, by another Person not a party to this Agreement (a "Third Party
Claim"), then the Indemnified Party will include in the Claim Notice (i)
notice of the commencement or threat of any Proceeding relating to such Third
Party Claim within 30 days after the Indemnified Party has received written
notice of the commencement of the Third Party Claim (unless the Third Party
Claim requires a shorter period to respond, in which case the period to notify
shall be reduced by one three-fourths of the period required to respond) and
(ii) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the
amount of the damages claimed by the other Person, in each case to the extent
known to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay or
deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or
obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
has suffered actual Losses directly caused by the delay or other deficiency.

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

-50-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Within 30 days after the Indemnified Party's delivery of a Claim Notice
under this Section 9.4, the Indemnifying Party may assume control of the
defense of such Third Party Claim by giving to the Indemnified Party written
notice of the intention to assume such defense, but if and only if the
Indemnifying Party further:

  

  

(i) acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any Losses that may
be assessed in connection with the Third Party Claim are eligible to
constitute Losses for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified pursuant
to this Article 9 without contest or objection and that the Indemnifying Party
will advance all expenses and costs of defense; and

  

  

(ii) retains counsel for the defense of the Third Party Claim reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and furnishes to the Indemnified Party
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party has and will have sufficient financial resources (including
insurance proceeds and/or available Escrow Funds) to fund on a current basis
the cost of such defense and pay reasonably expected Losses within applicable
caps hereunder that may arise under the Third Party Claim.

  

  

(c) However, if the Sellers are the Indemnifying Party, in no event may the
Indemnifying Party assume or maintain control of, the defense of any Third
Party Claim (A) involving criminal liability of any Acquired Company or any
directors, officers or Affiliates thereof, or (B) in which the outcome of any
Judgment or settlement in the matter could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the Indemnified Party's or the ability of the Indemnified Party to
conduct its business (collectively, clauses (A) and (B), the "Special Claims")
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser. An Indemnifying Party
will lose any previously acquired right to control the defense of any Third
Party Claim if for any reason the Indemnifying Party ceases to actively,
competently and diligently conduct the defense.

   

  

(d) The party not controlling the defense (the "Noncontrolling Party") may
participate therein at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or
is not able to, assume or maintain control of the defense of a Third Party
Claim in compliance with Section 9.4(b), the Indemnified Party will have the
right to control the defense of the Third Party Claim. The party controlling
the defense (the "Controlling Party") will reasonably advise the
Noncontrolling Party of the status of the Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and the Controlling Party will consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Noncontrolling Party. The Noncontrolling Party
will furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with
respect to such Third Party Claim and related Proceedings (including copies of
any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such
party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same) and will otherwise cooperate with and assist
in the defense of the Third Party Claim.

   

  

(e) If the Indemnified Party is controlling the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party has the right to agree in good faith to any
compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising from, the
Third Party Claim with prior Consent of the Indemnifying Party. All amounts
paid or payable under such settlement or Judgment are Losses that the
Indemnifying Party owes to the Indemnified Party under this Article 9 (except,
with respect to attorneys' or other professional fees and expenses and court
costs, that only reasonable attorneys' or other professional fees and expenses
and court costs will be indemnified hereunder). The Indemnifying Party will
not agree to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment
arising from, the Third Party Claim without the prior written Consent of the
Indemnified Party, which Consent the Indemnified Party will not unreasonably
withhold or delay. The Indemnified Party will have no liability with respect
to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising from,
any Third Party Claim effected without its Consent.

Section 9.5 Survival.

  

  

(a) All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations contained in
this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule will survive the Closing for a period of two years from the Closing
Date; except for (i) representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.18
(Environmental, Health and Safety Matters) which will survive for three years,
(ii) representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 (Tax Matters),
which will survive until 30 days following the expiration of the statute of
limitations (including extensions and/or continuances) applicable to the
underlying matters covered by such provisions, (iii) representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.2(b) (Authority and Enforceability), Section
3.3 (No Conflict) (to the extent such Section 3.3 relates to the title,
transfer and ownership of the shares of any Acquired Company) and Section
3.4(a) through (e) (Capitalization and Ownership), each of which will survive
for 50 years and (iv) covenants, obligations and other agreements which are
expressly intended to survive such date in accordance with their terms.

   

  

(b) All claims for indemnification under Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.2(a) must
be asserted prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set
forth in Section 9.5(a); provided, however, that if an Indemnified Party
delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before expiration of the applicable
survival period of a representation or warranty as set forth in Section
9.5(a) , either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of any such representation
or warranty, or a notice that, as a result of a claim or demand made by a
Person not a party to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party reasonably expects
to incur Losses, then the applicable representation or warranty will survive
until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such
notice. If the claim with respect to which such notice has been given is
definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party will promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party.

   

  

Section 9.6 Limitations on Liability.

  

  

(a) The Sellers shall not be liable under Section 9.1 for individual claims to
the extent that the Losses for any such claim are less than €25,000 ("De
Minimis Claims");

  

  

(b) The Sellers shall not be liable under Section 9.1 unless and until the
aggregate Losses (other than De Minimis Claims) for which the Sellers would
otherwise be liable under this Agreement exceed €1,000,000 (at which point the
Sellers are liable for the aggregate Losses (other than for De Minimis Claims)
from the first Euro and not just amounts in excess of that sum) (the
"Deductible").

  

  

(c) In no event will the Sellers' aggregate liability for Losses under this
Agreement exceed €30,000,000 (the "Cap").

  

  

(d) No Seller shall be liable for any other Seller's breach of Section 5.6
(Confidentiality) or Section 5.7 (Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation).

  

  

(e) Each Seller shall be responsible for the indemnification obligations
hereunder jointly with the other Sellers, provided that each such Seller shall
only be responsible for its proportionate share of any amount of indemnified
Losses on a pro rata basis with its respective percentage of shareholdings in
the Company. For the avoidance of any doubt, no Seller shall in any way be
responsible for, or may be forced or obliged to pay, any amount in excess of
such percentage

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the De Minimis Claims exception, the
Deductible and the Cap do not apply to the following:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-52-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) claims under Section 9.1(a) relating to a breach of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.2(b) (Authority and Enforceability),
Section 3.3 (No Conflict) (to the extent such Section 3.3 relates to the
title, transfer and ownership of the shares of any Acquired Company) and
Section 3.4(a) through (e) (Capitalization and Ownership);

   

  

(ii) claims under Section 9.1(d), (e), (f) and (g) (provided, however, the Cap
shall apply to Section 9.1(e)); and

  

  

(iii) any Proceedings, demands or assessments related to any of the matters
set forth in clauses (i) through (ii) above.

  

  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement will limit the liability of a party to another
party for fraud or willful misconduct.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Sellers' or the
Purchaser's aggregate liability for Losses under this Agreement exceed the
Purchase Price.

  

  

Section 9.7 Certain Damages. In no event will any party be liable under this
Agreement to any other party or other Person for special, indirect, punitive
or consequential damages (including lost profits) in connection with any
claims or Losses arising out of the conduct of such party pursuant to this
Agreement regardless of whether the nonperforming party was advised of the
possibility of such damages or not. The exclusion of such damages as set forth
in the preceding sentence will not apply to any such damages recovered by
third parties against a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Seller, as the case
may be, in connection with Losses that may be indemnified under this
Agreement. In addition, the Sellers shall not be liable under this Agreement
to any other party or other Person for any Losses to the extent that such
Losses (a) would not have occurred or arisen except as the result of a change
in Law occurring after the Effective Date or the Closing Date, as applicable,
and (b) are directly attributable to any change in accounting methods
(including consolidation methods) or policies of the Company occurring after
the Effective Date. Nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party from any
duty under applicable Law to mitigate any Loss incurred by it as a result of
any matter or circumstance giving rise to a claim under this Article 9. Except
in the case of fraud or willful misconduct and except as provided in Sections
2.5, 2.6, 7.2 and 10.12, the parties agree that following Closing the
indemnification provisions contained in this Article 9 constitute the sole and
exclusive remedies of the parties for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement.

   

  

Section 9.8 Insurance. In the case of any Loss for which a party would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, but as to
which (x) such party would be entitled to reimbursement or coverage under an
insurance policy that is effective and as to which premiums are fully paid in
place and has been in good standing at all times before Closing, such party
will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Loss by recovering
against the applicable insurance policy or indemnitor, and the amount of such
Loss will be reduced by any amounts actually received by such person under
such policy, or (y) such party would have been entitled to reimbursement or
coverage under an insurance policy maintained in good standing by an Acquired
Company prior to or at the Closing and which policy was terminated or the
coverage under which was subsequently reduced by the Purchaser following
Closing, the amount of such Loss will be reduced by any amounts that would
have been received under such policy originally maintained by such Acquired
Company.

   

  

Section 9.9 No Right of Indemnification or Contribution. No Seller has any
right of indemnification or contribution against any Acquired Company with
respect to any breach by the Sellers or the Company of any of their
representations, warranties, statements, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Public Deed or in any
certificate, instrument or other document delivered by or on behalf of any
Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement or the Public Deed, whether
by virtue of any contractual or statutory right of indemnity or otherwise,
and all claims to the contrary are hereby waived and released.

Section 9.10 Exercise of Remedies by Purchaser Indemnified Parties other than
the Purchaser. Purchaser Indemnified Party (other than the Purchaser or any
successor or assignee of the Purchaser) is entitled to assert any
indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless
the Purchaser (or any successor or assignee of the Purchaser) Consents to the
assertion of the indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

  

  

Section 9.11 Withholdings and Grossing Up.

  

  

(a) Indemnification payments under this Article 9 shall be paid free and clear
of all Tax deductions or withholding unless Law requires a deduction or
withholding to be made. If a Tax deduction or withholding is so required, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay such additional amount as will ensure that the
net amount the Indemnified Party receives equals the full amount which it
would have received had the deduction or withholding not been required. Such
additional amounts to be paid by the Indemnifying Party will be reduced to the
extent that such Tax deduction or withholding required by Law is later
recovered by the Indemnified Party (even after expiration of the relevant
time limit) in all or in part, even in the form of a reduction in its future
Tax payments, or in any other form whatsoever.

   

  

(b) If any Governmental Authority brings any sum paid under this Article 9
into charge to Tax, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay such additional
amount as will ensure that the total amount paid, less the Tax chargeable on
such amount, is equal to the amount that would otherwise be payable under this
Article 9.

  

  

(c) The amount of Loss will be reduced to the extent that it implies any
reduction of Taxes in connection with the Tax deductibility of the Loss
sustained by the Acquired Company.

  

  

(d) If the obligations under Section 9.11(a) are triggered, Sellers will be
free to decide to which Indemnified Party they make the indemnification
payment under this Article 9 among (i) Dresser-Rand group entities, and (ii)
the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, and to satisfy the payment to such
elected entity.

  

  

(e) The Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall attempt in good faith
for a period of 15 days to determine the amount of any increase or reduction
to an indemnification payment under this Article 9. If the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative do not agree on the amount of any such increase or
reduction by the end of the 15-day period, then the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative will submit the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm for
resolution. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be
shared by the Purchaser, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, in
inverse proportion to the relative amounts of the disputed amount determined
to be for the account of the Purchaser and the Sellers, respectively.

   

  

ARTICLE 10

  

GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

Section 10.1 Seller Representative.

  

  

(a) By virtue of their execution of this Agreement, each Seller designates and
appoints Joseba Grajales (the "Seller Representative") as such Seller's agent
and attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to act for and on behalf of
each Seller to give and receive notices and communications, to accept service
of process on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.4(e) and Section
10.13, to authorize and agree to any Net Debt adjustments pursuant to Section
2.6 and other applicable provisions of this Agreement, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with
Judgments of courts or other Governmental Authorities and awards of
arbitrators, with respect to, any claims by any Purchaser Indemnified Party
against any Seller or by any Seller against any Purchaser Indemnified Party,
or any other dispute between any Purchaser Indemnified Party and any Seller,
in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to take all actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Seller Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement. Notices or communications to or from the Seller Representative
constitute notice to or from each of the Sellers for all purposes under this
Agreement. Details regarding the Seller Representative are provided on
Schedule I.

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

-54-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In the event of the death or incapacity of the Seller Representative, or
the termination of the Seller Representative by the decision of the majority
of Sellers, a successor Seller Representative will be elected promptly by the
Sellers (upon prior written consent of the Purchaser, with such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld). Each successor Seller Representative has all of the
power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the
original Seller Representative, and the term "Seller Representative" as used
in this Agreement includes any successor Seller Representative.

  

  

(c) A decision, act, instruction or Consent of the Seller Representative
constitutes a decision, act, instruction or Consent of all the Sellers and is
final, binding and conclusive upon the Sellers, and the Purchaser and the
Escrow Agent may rely upon any such decision, act, instruction or Consent of
the Seller Representative as being the decision, act, instruction or Consent
of the Sellers. The Purchaser is hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done or omissions by the Purchaser in accordance with such
decision, act, instruction or Consent of the Seller Representative. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Purchaser and the Escrow
Agent is entitled to rely, without inquiry, upon any document delivered by
the Seller Representative as being genuine and correct and having been duly
signed or sent by the Seller Representative.

   

  

(d) This appointment and grant of power and authority by the Sellers to the
Seller Representative pursuant to this Section 10.1 is made in consideration
of the common interest of the Sellers and the Seller Representative to
facilitate the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including any post-Closing
actions) and is in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants made
in this Agreement. It is therefore irrevocable and may not be terminated by
the act of any Seller or by operation of Law, whether upon the death or
incapacity of any Seller, or by the occurrence of any other event.

  

  

Section 10.2 Notices. All notices and other communications under this
Agreement must be in writing and are deemed duly delivered when (a) delivered
if delivered personally or by nationally recognized overnight courier service

Section 10.3 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified except in a written document signed by each party to be
bound by the amendment and that identifies itself as an amendment to this
Agreement. Any amendment of this Agreement signed by the Seller Representative
is binding upon and effective against each Seller regardless of whether or not
such Seller has in fact signed such amendment.

  

  

Section 10.4 Waiver and Remedies. The parties may (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party to this
Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
any other party to this Agreement contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
(c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement. Any such extension
or waiver by any party to this Agreement will be valid only if set forth in a
written document signed on behalf of the party or parties against whom the
waiver or extension is to be effective and delivered in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.2. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy
or partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or further
exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

-56-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties, or any of them, written
or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Non-Disclosure Agreement will remain in effect in
accordance with its terms as modified pursuant to Section 5.6.

   

  

Section 10.6 Assignment and Successors and No Third Party Rights. This
Agreement binds and benefits the parties and their respective heirs,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns. None of the parties hereto
may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without, in the case of any Seller, the prior written Consent of the Purchaser
and, in the case of the Purchaser, the prior written Consent of the Sellers,
as represented by the Seller Representative; provided, that Dresser-Rand Group
may assign this Agreement and/or any or all of its respective rights and
obligations as Purchaser hereunder to any of its Affiliates without such prior
written Consent (and, upon any such assignment, references to the "Purchaser"
herein shall refer to such assignee); provided, further, that no such
assignment shall release such party from any of its obligations or liabilities
hereunder. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation hereof shall be
null and void ab initio. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement
will be construed to give any Person, other than the parties to this
Agreement, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement except such
rights as may inure to a successor or permitted assignee under this Section
10.6.

   

  

Section 10.7 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way
and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid,
illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable
provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision.

   

  

Section 10.8 Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
Agreement. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule are arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered
and lettered sections and paragraphs of Article 3, Article 4 and Article 5, as
applicable. The disclosure in any section or paragraph of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule qualifies other
sections and paragraphs in this Agreement only to the extent it is reasonably
ascertainable by the content of the disclosure that a given disclosure is
applicable to such other sections and paragraphs. The Sellers may update the
Seller Disclosure Schedule following the Effective Date, but, except pursuant
to this clause, such update shall (a) not be considered a part of this
Agreement, (b) not be considered properly disclosed under this Agreement and
(c) be disregarded in construing this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and subject to this section, the Sellers may supplement or amend the Seller
Disclosure Schedule following the Effective Date and prior to Closing with
respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or
known at the Effective Date, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Seller Disclosure Schedule. In such case, the Seller
Representative shall deliver a copy of the amendment or supplement (in either
case, the "Additional Disclosure") to the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall have
seven days after receipt in which to review the Additional Disclosure. If the
Purchaser consents, in its reasonable discretion, to the Additional Disclosure
being added to the Seller Disclosure Schedule such Additional Disclosure shall
be added and become a part of the Seller Disclosure Schedule as if included in
the Seller Disclosure Schedule on the Effective Date. If the Purchaser does
not consent to such Additional Disclosure being added to the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, such Additional Disclosure shall be "Supplemental Disclosure" and
shall not be so added. The Purchaser shall provide written notice to the
Seller Representative of its decision within the seven day review period
referenced above and, if notice is not given within such time period, the
Additional Disclosure shall be deemed Supplemental Disclosure.

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

-57-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.9 Interpretation. In the negotiation of this Agreement, each party
has received advice from its own legal counsel. The language used in this
Agreement is the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no provision of this Agreement will be interpreted for or against
any party because that party or its attorney drafted the provision.

  

  

Section 10.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the Laws of France (without regard to conflict of
Law principles), except to the extent the corporate Law of the State of
Delaware or Spain mandatorily applies.

  

  

Section 10.11 Disputes.

  

  

(a) In the event of a dispute arising out of or in relation to this Agreement
(a "Dispute"), any party to the Dispute may deliver a written dispute notice
to the other party to the Dispute. The written disputes notice shall refer to
this clause and must contain reasonable details of the Dispute as well as the
Losses, if any, suffered by the party giving the written dispute notice. The
parties to a Dispute must, no later than 10 Business Days after delivery of
the written dispute notice, hold a meeting (the "Dispute Meeting") at which
they must use all reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute in an amicable
manner.

   

  

(b) In the Dispute, the Seller Representative will represent any and all
Sellers and Vincent R. Volpe Jr. will represent the Purchaser, with each
having sufficient authority to conduct negotiations on behalf of the Sellers
and the Purchaser, respectively, and, if relevant, to settle the Dispute.

  

  

(c) Any Dispute which is not amicably resolved within 20 Business Days after
delivery of the written dispute notice shall (regardless of whether or not a
Dispute Meeting has actually been held) at the request of any party to the
Dispute, be referred to arbitration in accordance with the Rules of
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce then in effect. The place
of arbitration shall be Paris, France. The language of the arbitration
Proceedings shall be English. The Seller Representative shall appoint one
arbitrator and the Purchaser shall appoint one arbitrator and the two
arbitrators so appointed shall agree on a third arbitrator, who shall be the
chairman of the arbitration tribunal. If a party fails to appoint an
arbitrator or the two arbitrators appointed by the parties cannot agree on a
third arbitrator, in each case within 30 calendar days, then the relevant
arbitrator shall be appointed by the Secretariat of the International Chamber
of Commerce within 15 calendar days of receiving such request.

   

  

(d) On or before the 45th day following (and including) the date on which
third arbitrator was finally selected, the arbitrators shall render a written
judgment with respect to each matter involved in the Dispute. The award of the
arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties. The arbitrators shall
decide all issues in dispute pursuant to applicable Law as specified in
Section 10.10.

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 10.11 limits the right of a party to bring
Proceedings against another party in any courts of competent jurisdiction to
enforce an arbitration award rendered in accordance with this Section 10.11.

  

  

(f) Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to claim any
immunity from Proceedings brought by another party against it under this
Section 10.11 (and to ensure that no such claim is made on its behalf). Each
party hereby consents generally to the giving of any relief or the issue of
any process in connection with those Proceedings, and waives all rights of
immunity in respect of it or its assets.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-58-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.12 Specific Performance. Without limiting the obligation to
arbitrate under this Section 10.12, the parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the covenants in Sections 5.6, 5.7 and
5.8 were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. The parties accordingly agree that, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, the parties
are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of Sections 5.6, 5.7 and
5.8 and otherwise to enforce specifically Sections 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8. Each
party expressly waives any requirement that any other party obtain any bond or
provide any indemnity in connection with any action seeking injunctive relief
or specific enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement.

   

  

Section 10.13 Jurisdiction and Service of Process. In any action or Proceeding
between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the extent not subject
to Section 10.11), the parties submit non-exclusively to the jurisdiction of
(a) Madrid, Spain, if the action is commenced by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (in which event cross-claims and counterclaims may also be made in
such jurisdiction), or (b) Houston Texas, if the action is commenced by the
Sellers or the Seller Representative (and cross-claims and counterclaims may
also be made in such jurisdiction. Any party to this Agreement may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the
party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.13, however, affects the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

   

  

Section 10.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. each of the parties knowingly, voluntarily
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all right to
trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of any party to
this Agreement in negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement of
this Agreement .

   

  

Section 10.15 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
party will pay its respective direct and indirect expenses incurred by it in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all
fees and expenses of its advisors and representatives. All amounts relating to
any financial, legal, accounting or other advisor, and all other transaction
fees and expenses incurred by the Acquired Companies prior to Closing
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will be paid by the Sellers in full on or prior to the Closing Date
or will be fully accrued as current liabilities on the accounting records of
the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date. If this Agreement is
terminated, the obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will be
subject to any rights of such party arising from any breach of this Agreement
by another party.

   

  

Section 10.16 No Joint Venture. Nothing in this Agreement creates a joint
venture or partnership between the parties. This Agreement does not authorize
any party (a) to bind or commit, or to act as an agent, employee or legal
representative of, the other party, except as may be specifically set forth in
other provisions of this Agreement or (b) to have the power to control the
activities and operations of the other party. The parties are independent
contractors with respect to each other under this Agreement. Each
party agrees not to hold itself out as having any authority or relationship
contrary to this Section 10.16.

   

  

Section 10.17 Counterparts. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the
other parties. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same
counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email
transmission that includes a copy of the sending party's signature(s) is as
effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.
