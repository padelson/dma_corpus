 (a) The closing of the Transaction (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 A.M., New York time, on the last day of the month in which the last unfulfilled and unwaived condition to be satisfied prior to the Closing set forth in Article VI hereof shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , that if Sellers notify Buyer on or before February 1, 2004 that Sellers determine that they cannot accurately prepare the necessary financial and other information for Closing as of a month end that is not a quarter end, the Closing shall take place on the last day of the calendar quarter on which such condition is satisfied (such time, the "Closing Date") at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 4 Times Square, New York, NY 10036, or such other place as the parties may agree. Closing shall be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the next day. 

    (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, Sellers may implement the transactions contemplated by Sections 2.4 and 2.1, 2.2, or 2.3 hereof (the "Restructuring") as of any month end that is reasonably expected to be more than thirty-one (31) days prior to the Closing Date, provided, that (i) Buyer shall be permitted to participate fully with Sellers in all communications with Governmental Entities relating to the Restructuring unless Sellers conclude in their reasonable judgment that (A) there is a substantial risk that the Transaction will not be completed and (B) as to a particular communication, the full participation of Buyer in such communication would reveal either sensitive confidential information about Sellers business plans in the event the Transaction is not completed or information about Sellers proposed response to the risk of the Transaction not being completed and (ii) Sellers shall consult and confer with Buyers regarding developments relating to the implementation of the Restructuring and keep Buyer fully informed of any proposals made to and any conditions discussed with, requested by or imposed by Governmental Entities in connection with implementation of the Restructuring, and such Restructuring is effected on terms and conditions that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Negative Condition; and provided further, that if the Restructuring is implemented prior to the Closing, Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees from any Losses by any Buyer Indemnitees that would not have been incurred had such implementation occurred at Closing (taking into account any economic concessions by Sellers in connection with such implementation). Buyer Indemnitees shall exercise the indemnification rights provided in this Section 2.7(b) as if such rights were exercised pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i), provided that such indemnification shall not be subject to the third sentence of Section 7.3(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limitation to Section 5.6, if the Restructuring is to be implemented as of or immediately prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall consult and confer with Buyer regarding any aspects of the implementation of the Restructuring differing from those provided for by the Ancillary Agreements and obtain the approval of Buyer for any such aspect, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 Section 2.9 _Statements of Net Settlement._

  

 (a) Attached hereto as (i) Schedule 2.9(a) (i) is a form of statement of the Liabilities of the Business, including the Reinsured Liabilities and Assumed 

    Liabilities but excluding the Excluded Liabilities, and related Separate
Account Assets and General Account Reinsurance Premium Assets (the

 (b) CGLIC shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date a proposed Statement of Net Settlement estimated as of the Closing Date in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods. Buyer shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed Statement of Net Settlement and Sellers shall provide Buyer with access to such information and personnel as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with such review and comment. Buyer shall provide any comments on the proposed Statement of Net Settlement at least one (1) day prior to the Closing Date and Buyer and CGLIC shall negotiate in good faith a resolution of any differences in the amounts stated on the proposal. The Statement of Net Settlement prepared by CGLIC, as revised to reflect any revisions thereto agreed to by CGLIC and Buyer, shall be the "Estimated Statement of Net Settlement"; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any differences between CGLIC and Buyer as to such Statement of Net Settlement are not resolved by the Closing Date, the Statement of Net Settlement estimated as of the Closing Date and prepared by CGLIC and revised by CGLIC to reflect any revisions thereto agreed to by CGLIC and Buyer, but not any of Buyers comments not agreed to by CGLIC, shall be the "Estimated Statement of Net Settlement". 

  

 (c) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, CGLIC shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a Statement of Net Settlement as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Statement of Net Settlement") in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods.

If Buyer and CGLIC are able to agree within one-hundred twenty (120) days of Buyers receipt of the Closing Statement 

     of Net Settlement, or earlier as mutually agreed to, that (A)
the methodologies, procedures, judgments, assumptions and estimates used in
the preparation of the Closing Statement of Net Settlement conform to the
Statement of Net Settlement Methods, (B) CGLIC has not committed any
arithmetic error in the calculation of any of the numerical data underlying
the line items on the Closing Statement of Net Settlement, (C) Data Input
Inaccuracies did not affect any line items of the Closing Statement of Net
Settlement and (D) if any judgment involved in the calculation of any line
item in the Closing Statement of Net Settlement is not addressed by the

the applicable Specified Judgment, then the Closing Statement of
Net Settlement shall be deemed to be the "Final Statement of Net Settlement"
for purposes of Section 2.11.

  

 (e)If the parties are not able to agree to the matters set forth in the previous paragraph within one-hundred twenty (120) days of Buyers receipt of the Closing Statement of Net Settlement, then the Closing Statement of Net Settlement shall be promptly submitted for resolution to the Third Party Accountant pursuant to Section 2.10.

CIGNA, on behalf of itself and the other Sellers, agrees that following the Closing Date CIGNA Life and Buyer shall have such access to the books and records, including internal accounting records relating to the Business, and employees involved with the Business and Subject Contracts as Buyer or CIGNA Life may reasonably request for the review of the Closing Statement of Net Settlement or Buyers objections thereto. 

  

 (g)Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the conveyance of the Subject Contracts shall be paid in accordance with Section 5.13 hereof and shall not be reflected as an asset or a liability on any Statement of Net Settlement Liability. 

  

 Section 2.10 _Third Party Accountant._

   

 (a) Within forty-five (45) days after the delivery of the Closing Statement of Net Settlement to the Third Party Accountant pursuant to Section 2.9(e), the Third Party Accountant shall review the Closing Statement of Net Settlement and render a written report thereon to Buyer, CIGNA Life and CGLIC (the "Third Party Accountant Report"). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that such review by the Third Party Accountant and the Third Party Accountant Report shall be limited to, and only to, a determination by the Third Party Accountant as to the Permitted Factors. In conducting its review, the Third Party Accountant shall take into consideration submissions made by Buyer and CGLIC with regard to the Permitted Factors, and the basis for the parties respective views. The Third Party Accountant Report shall include a reasonably detailed 

   description of any change to the Closing Statement of Net Settlement that
results from the Third Party Accountants review of the Closing Statement
of Net Settlement and a restatement by the Third Party Accountant of the
Closing Statement of Net Settlement which reflects any changes made by the
Third Party Accountant (such statement to be deemed the "Final Statement of
Net Settlement" for purposes of Section 2.11), _provided_ , _however_ , that
each individual adjustment reflected on the Final Statement of Net
Settlement, if there are any, must be based solely upon a finding by the
Third Party Accountant that (A) CGLIC utilized methodologies, procedures,
judgments, assumptions and estimates that were not provided for in the
Statement of Net Settlement Methods, (B) CGLIC committed any arithmetic error
in the calculation of any line item on the Closing Statement of Net
Settlement, (C) Data Input Inaccuracies affected one or more line items in
the Closing Statement of Net Settlement, or (D) if any judgment involved in
the calculation of any line item in the Closing Statement of Net Settlement
is not provided for by the Statement of Net Settlement Methods, such judgment
is not in accordance with the applicable Specified Judgment. The dollar
amount of each such individual adjustment to the total liabilities as shown
on the Closing Statement of Net Settlement shall not be greater than the
dollar amount which corresponds to the underlying finding set forth in the
foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D) which the Third Party Accountant used
to justify such adjustment. The fees, costs and expenses of the Third Party
Accountant shall be shared equally by CGLIC and CIGNA Life.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Third Party Accountant shall not be authorized to make any adjustments to the Closing Statement of Net Settlement which are not based solely upon the Permitted Factors and (ii) the Third Party Accountant shall not review or make any adjustment (A) to a line item on or other matter involving the Closing Statement of Net Settlement not challenged pursuant to Section 2.9(e) or (B) based on the valuation of any Transferred Investment Assets reflected in the Closing Statement of Net Settlement. 

  

 (c) Following the Closing Date, the Third Party Accountant shall have access to any of Sellers, CIGNA Lifes, Buyers and their respective Affiliates accounting records relating to the Business and Subject Contracts and employees involved with the Business and Subject Contracts, including with respect to the preparation by CGLIC, and the review by Buyer of the Estimated Statement of Net Settlement, and the preparation by CGLIC, and the review by CIGNA Life, of the Closing Statement of Net Settlement. 

  

 (d) Any (i) determination made by the Third Party Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.10 or (ii) agreement by the parties pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.9(d) shall be final and binding on Buyer, CIGNA Life and Sellers. For purposes hereof, "final and binding" shall mean that the aforesaid determination or agreement, as the case may be, shall have the same preclusive effect for all purposes as a 

   determination embodied in a final judgment, no longer subject to appeal and
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction after full and fair litigation on
the merits.

  

 Section 2.11 _Post-Closing Adjustment._

   

 (a) In the event that (i) the General Account Reinsurance Premium determined by reference to the Final Statement of Net Settlement exceeds the General Account Reinsurance Premium determined by reference to the Estimated Statement of Net Settlement, then Sellers shall transfer to the Ceded Business Trust assets (selected in accordance with Investment Asset Identification Protocol) with an aggregate statutory carrying value determined in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods equal to such excess within five (5) Business Days of the delivery of the Final Statement of Net Settlement, plus interest on such amount from and including the Closing Date up to but not including the date of payment accrued at the 60-Day Treasury Rate, or (ii) the General Account Reinsurance Premium determined by reference to the Final Statement of Net Settlement is less than the General Account Reinsurance Premium determined by reference to the Estimated Statement of Net Settlement, then CIGNA Life, directly or from the Ceded Business Trust, as determined in accordance with the Coinsurance Agreement and the Ceded Business Trust Agreement, shall return to CGLIC assets (selected in accordance with the Investment Asset Identification Protocol) previously transferred by CGLIC to the Ceded Business Trust with an aggregate statutory carrying value determined in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods equal to such shortfall within five (5) Business Days of the delivery to the Buyer of the Final Statement of Net Settlement, plus interest on such amount from and including the Closing Date up to but not including the date of payment accrued at the 60-Day Treasury Rate. The foregoing shall apply to the Guaranteed Cost Reinsurance Premium, provided that any adjustment to the Guaranteed Cost Reinsurance Premium shall be transferred to the Guaranteed Cost Business Trust by CGLIC or from the Guaranteed Cost Business Trust by the trustee thereof to CGLIC, as the case may be. 

  

 (b) On the Closing Date all Separate Account Assets as of such date shall be retained in the corresponding Modco Account. In the event any Separate Account Assets are not retained in the appropriate Modco Account at Closing, Sellers shall cause such assets to be transferred thereto promptly after discovery thereof, together with any interest, dividends or other earnings after the Closing Date in respect of such assets. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event CGLIC (i) fails to transfer to CIGNA Life or to the Ceded Business Trust, as the case may be, an asset reflected on either the Estimated Statement of Net Settlement or the Final Statement of Net Settlement, or (ii) erroneously transfers an Investment Asset to CIGNA Life which was not reflected on either the Estimated Statement of Net Settlement or the Final Statement of Net Settlement (and which was not to be transferred pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement), the parties agree to correct such error by effectuating a transfer or return, as the case may be, of the 

    assets in question (or cash equal to the fair market value of such asset)
promptly upon receipt of a written notice from the other party describing
the error. All written notice of any such error shall be provided on or
before the second anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

 (d)(i) In the event that (A) there are inaccuracies or omissions in the factual data inputs utilized in the calculation of Insurance-Related Liabilities or the value of Transferred Investment Assets not addressed by Section 2.11(c) (such as inputting the wrong CUSIP number or interest rate), including data (and the omission of data) relating to the inventory of policies in force, the terms of such policies, the relevant information related to the holders or annuitants of such policies and activities related thereto, CUSIP numbers, interest rates, principal amounts, the terms of loan documents and organizational documents, the terms of leases, lease abstracts and rent rolls, or such factual data inputs are coded, compiled or aggregated inaccurately, other than omissions in the factual data inputs utilized in the calculation of the Insurance-Related Liabilities resulting from reasonable judgments by an actuary or other financial professional as to the scope of factual data inputs (or omissions of factual data inputs) (a "Data Input Inaccuracy"); (B) such Data Input Inaccuracy has resulted in a demonstrable error in the aggregate Insurance-Related Liabilities reflected on the Final Statement of Net Settlement or in the aggregate statutory carrying value (determined in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods) of the Transferred Investment Assets, and (C) Buyer has transmitted to Sellers a Notice of Demand (as defined below) with respect to such Data Input Inaccuracy prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, then the requirements of this Section 2.11(d) shall be applicable. 

  

 (ii)"Adjustment Amount" shall be any amount, positive or negative, equal to (A)(x) 0.5 multiplied by (y) the Specified Data Input Factors Amount; _provided_ _that_ such amount, when cumulated with all prior amounts pursuant to this Section 2.11(d)(ii), shall not be greater than an aggregate amount of $100 million or be less than an aggregate amount of negative $100 million; _provided_ _further_ _that_ if such amount is positive the Adjustment Amount shall be increased by the amount, if any, that the aggregate Losses incurred by Buyer Indemnities pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) hereof and this Section 2.11(d) (treating any positive amount under this Section 2.11(d)(ii) as Losses solely for purposes of the third sentence of Section 7.3(c)) are less than the Deductible, but only to the extent of the product of (A)(x) multiplied by A(y). 

  

 (iii)"Net Data Adjustment Amount" shall be the amount, positive or negative, equal to the Positive Data Input Inaccuracies Amount minus the Offsetting Data Input Inaccuracies Amount minus the Adjustment Amount. 

  

 (iv)"Offsetting Data Input Inaccuracies Amount" means the absolute value of the amount of the aggregate decrease in Insurance-Related Liabilities reflected on the Final Statement of Net Settlement plus the amount of the aggregate increase in the statutory carrying value (determined in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods) of the Transferred Investment Assets resulting from Data Input Inaccuracies 

    (excluding any excess in the Transferred Investment Assets resulting from the
decrease in the Insurance-Related Liabilities).

  

 (v)"Positive Data Input Inaccuracies Amount" means the amount of the aggregate increase in Insurance-Related Liabilities reflected on the Final Statement of Net Settlement plus the absolute value of the amount of the aggregate decrease in the statutory carrying value (determined in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods) of the Transferred Investment Assets resulting from Data Input Inaccuracies (excluding any shortfall in the Transferred Investment Assets resulting from the increase in the Insurance-Related Liabilities). 

   

 (vi)"Specified Data Input Factors" means (A) errors and omissions in any information provided by the holder of, or annuitant under, Subject Contracts or by any Person who is not an Affiliate or employee of Sellers and (B) the design features and functioning of, and defects in, any software or hardware.

 (viii) At any time prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer may transmit to Sellers a written notice stating that one or more Data Input Inaccuracies have resulted in a demonstrable error in the aggregate Insurance-Related Liabilities reflected on the Final Statement of Net Settlement or in the aggregate statutory carrying value (determined in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods) of all the Transferred Investment Assets, which identifies with reasonable specificity the (A) relevant Data Input Inaccuracy or Data Input Inaccuracies, (B) the effect of such Data Input Inaccuracy or Data Input Inaccuracies on the aggregate Insurance-Related Liabilities reflected on the Final Statement of Net Settlement or the aggregate statutory carrying value (determined in accordance with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods) of the Transferred Investment Assets, and (C) the Positive Data Input Inaccuracies Amount and, if any, the Offsetting Data Input Inaccuracies Amount and Adjustment Amount (a "Notice of Demand"). 

  

 (ix) In the event that Buyer transmits a Notice of Demand to Sellers pursuant to Section 2.11(d)(viii), as a condition precedent to any payment under Section 2.11(d)(xii) Sellers shall have access for a reasonable period of time not to exceed nine (9) months to CIGNA Lifes, Buyers and its Affiliates books and records, including internal accounting records, and employees as Sellers may reasonably request, for purposes of verifying the information provided to Sellers in the Notice of Demand and identifying any Offsetting Data Input Inaccuracies. Any information provided to Sellers pursuant to the previous sentence shall be kept confidential by Sellers. Any verification, examination or interview by or on behalf of Sellers or access pursuant to this Section 2.11(d)(ix) shall be conducted or occur at reasonable times, during regular business 

   hours, upon reasonable prior written notice and in a manner that does not

 (xi)In the event of any dispute between the parties relating to the matters set forth in this Section 2.11(d), once Sellers have completed their review of the Buyers Notice of Demand and any Offsetting Data Input Inaccuracies, Sellers and Buyer shall retain an independent actuarial firm mutually acceptable to Sellers and Buyer or, if they are unable to agree, designated by The American Arbitration Association ("Third Party Actuary") who shall review the Buyers Notice of Demand, together with any supporting information thereto provided by the Buyer, together with Sellers response to the Buyers Notice of Demand, together with any supporting information thereto provided by the Sellers. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that such review by the Third Party Actuary shall be limited to, and only to, a determination by the Third Party Actuary as to the correct Net Data Adjustments Amount, Positive Data Input Inaccuracies Amount, Offsetting Data Input Inaccuracies Amount, Specified Data Input Factors Amount and Adjustment Amount in accordance with Section 2.11(d). In conducting its review, the Third Party Actuary shall take into consideration submissions made by Sellers and Buyer and the basis for the parties respective views. Any determination made by the Third Party Actuary pursuant to this Section 2.11(d)(xi) shall be final and binding (as such term is defined in Section 2.10(d) of this Agreement) on Sellers and Buyer. 

  

 (xii)Within ten (10) days following either agreement by the parties as to the matters set forth in paragraph (x) or the determination of the Third Party Actuary pursuant to paragraph (xi), Sellers shall pay to Buyer any positive Net Data Adjustment Amount or Buyer shall pay to Sellers the absolute value of any negative Net Data Adjustment Amount. Payment shall be made by payment of cash or cash equivalents in immediately available funds. In the event of multiple adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.11(d) as a result of the issuance of more than one Notice of Demand, the aggregate Positive Data Input Inaccuracies Amounts, Offsetting Data Input Inaccuracies Amounts and Adjustment Amounts and net amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.11(d) shall be cumulated so that any settlement pursuant to this paragraph takes into account all such Net Data Adjustment Amounts, Positive Data Input Inaccuracies Amounts, Offsetting Data Input Inaccuracies Amounts, Specified Data Input Factors Amounts, Adjustment Amounts and the net amounts previously paid. 

  

 (xiii)In no event shall any of the provisions of this Section 2.11(d) apply to the Insurance Related Liabilities associated with the Guaranteed Cost Coinsurance

      (i)  |   |

 making investments in the ordinary course of business, including in a

such entity or (ii) is a participant with any other Person in any group with
such intention or right;

  
---|---|---

 selling and/or underwriting insurance as well as all services and
products relating thereto, other than insurance products and services
comprising the Business;

  
---|---|--- 
   
      (v)  |   |

 providing investment management and similar services to Sellers or
Affiliates of Sellers; or

  
---|---|--- 
   
      (vi)  |   |

 acquiring any business that includes operations the conduct of which by
Sellers would, but for this Section 5.2(a)(vi), otherwise violate the
restrictions of this Section 5.2(a), if the primary purpose of such
acquisition is not to acquire any Competing Business and the Competing
Business comprises less than 15% of the assets, earnings and cash flow of the
acquired business.

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (b) For a period of two and a half (2.5) years from the Closing Date, Sellers shall refrain from taking any action which, as regards the Business, is reasonably likely to materially and negatively affect Buyers or CIGNA Lifes relationships in the aggregate with policyholders, reinsurers or annuityholders associated with the Business;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if Sellers or their Affiliates are engaged in any business or selling any product not in violation of Section 5.2(a) then such conduct and any consequences thereof shall not be deemed a breach of this Section 5.2(b). 

  

 (c) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.2 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for these covenants, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that this Section 5.2 constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by the parties. 

  

 (d) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the type and periods of restriction imposed in the provisions of this Section 5.2 are fair and reasonable and are reasonably required for the protection of the parties. If any of the restrictions or covenants in this Section 5.2 are hereafter construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the remainder of the covenant or covenants, which shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid portions. If any of the restrictions or covenants contained in this Section 5.2, or any portion thereof, are deemed to be unenforceable because such covenant or restriction is held to cover a geographic area or to be of such 

    duration as is not permitted under Applicable Law, the parties agree that the
court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the
duration and/or areas of such provision and, in its reduced form, said
provision shall then be enforceable. The parties hereto intend to and hereby
confer jurisdiction to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.2
upon the courts of any state or other jurisdiction within the geographical
scope of such covenants. In the event that the courts of any one or more of
such jurisdictions shall hold such covenants wholly unenforceable by reason
of the breadth of such scope or otherwise, it is the intention of the parties
hereto that such determination not bar or in any way affect the parties
rights to the relief provided above in the courts of any states or
jurisdictions within the geographical scope of such covenants as to breaches
of such covenants in such other respective states or jurisdictions, the above
covenants as they relate to each such jurisdiction being, for this purpose,
severable into diverse and independent covenants.

  

 (e) If any party hereto commits a breach, or is about to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 5.2, the other parties hereto shall have the right to have the provisions of this Section 5.2 specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to each of the non-breaching parties and that money damages may not provide an adequate remedy to such parties. In addition, in connection with this Section 5.2, each of the parties hereto may take all such other actions and remedies available to it under law or in equity and shall be entitled to such damages as it can show it has sustained by reason of such breach.

The restrictions on soliciting or attempting to employ as an employee or retain as a consultant or independent contractor set forth in this Section 5.3(a) shall not be deemed violated by virtue of general advertisements, searches or other broad-based hiring methods not specifically targeted or directed to Affected Employees.

or retain as a consultant or independent contractor set forth in this Section

searches or other broad-based hiring methods not specifically targeted or
directed to Excluded Employees, but the prohibition on hiring shall be
violated by any hiring in response to such methods.

     Section   |   |

5.4 _Reinsurance Credit Covenants._

     Section   |   |

5.5 _Affected Employees._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a) Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Sellers have provided Buyer true, correct and complete lists of each Person who supports the Retirement Services Business or is exclusively or principally employed in the conduct of the Retirement Services Business (the employees shall be referred to as the "Retirement Services Employees" and the list shall be referred to as the "Retirement Services Employees List"). Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Sellers have provided Buyer true, correct and complete lists of each Person who supports the Investment Business or is exclusively or principally employed in the conduct of the Investment Business (the employees shall be referred to as the "Investment Employees" and the list shall be referred to as the "Investment Employees List"). The Retirement Services Employees and the Investment Employees shall be referred to herein collectively as the "Business Employees". Sellers shall provide Buyers with updated versions of these lists prior to the Closing Date, but any additions to or deletions from the lists that are not made in the ordinary course shall be made with the consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (b) Effective on the Closing Date, Buyer shall employ or shall cause the Acquired Companies to employ all of the Retirement Services Employees, except those Inactive Employees on the Closing Date as described below, and those Optional Retirement Services Employees described in Section 5.5(e) below, who do not receive or accept offers from Buyer. Except as provided in Section 5.5(d) below with respect to anyone on the Excluded Investment Employee List, Buyer may make offers of employment effective on the Closing Date to any of the Investment Employees on the Investment Employee List. Those Retirement Services Employees who are thereafter employed by the Buyer, and those Investment Employees and Optional Retirement Services Employees who accept offers of employment with the Buyer shall be referred to 

   as "Affected Employees." Any Affected Employee who is on a leave of absence
on the Closing Date because of short-term disability, family medical leave,
military leave, or workers compensation (hereinafter "Inactive Employees")
shall remain employed by one of Sellers or an Affiliate of Sellers and shall
continue to receive compensation and benefits in accordance with the Plans
and policies of Sellers. Any Inactive Employee returning from short-term
disability, family medical, or workers compensation leave of absence within
12 weeks of the Closing Date shall have employment rights, if any, with
Buyer, and if employed by Buyer, they shall be covered under the terms of
Section 5.5 of this Agreement. Inactive Employees returning from military
leave after the Closing Date shall have employment rights, if any, with
Buyer, according to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act of 1994. If any Affected Employee becomes eligible to receive
long-term disability benefits under the Sellers long-term disability
program, such benefits shall be paid pursuant to the terms of the Sellers
long-term disability program and Buyer shall have no obligation to employ
such employee at that time or at any future time. Any such Inactive Employee
that Buyer employs pursuant to the preceding provision shall be an Affected
Employee from and after the date of hire. If, as of the Closing Date
and despite reasonably diligent efforts, Buyer is not yet able to move the
Affected Employees to its payroll and/or employee benefit administration
systems, Seller and Buyer agree, consistent with Section 5.18(a) of this
Agreement, to enter into an employee leasing arrangement for a period of up
to sixty (60) days from and after the Closing Date. Under this arrangement
Sellers will continue to employ, pay and provide employee benefits to the
Affected Employees, and Buyer will reimburse Sellers for all their out of
pocket costs related to such continued employment (including any additional
costs Sellers incur because any Affected Employee earns credit for
an additional year of service under Sellers pension and or 401(k) plans
during the term of such leasing arrangement).

  

 (c) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide or cause the Acquired Companies to provide employment to the Affected Employees: (i) in the same or comparable positions; (ii) in the same locations; (iii) at the same or better base salary rate, all as were provided to such Affected Employees by Sellers or the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall provide or shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide the Affected Employees with the opportunity to participate in Buyers compensation and bonus plans on the same terms as those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and with the same employee benefits as provided to such similarly situated employees. 

  

 (d) Seller has heretofore provided Buyer a list of Retirement Services Employees who shall not be employed by Buyer (the "Excluded Retirement Services Employees List"). Seller may amend the Excluded Retirement Services Employees List prior to the Closing Date with the consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No later than ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer a list of Investment Employees who shall not be employed by Buyer (the "Excluded Investment Employees List"). Buyer may request that any Investment 

    Employee be removed from the Excluded Investment Employees List, and Seller
may grant or deny Buyers request at Sellers discretion.

  

 (e) Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Seller has provided to Buyer a list of Retirement Services Employees whom Seller intends to retain after Closing (these employees shall be referred to as the "Optional Retirement Services Employees"). Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make employment offers, effective on the Closing Date, to the Optional Retirement Services Employees, and will employ only those Optional Retirement Services Employees who accept employment offers from Buyer. Any Optional Retirement Services Employee (i) who does not receive an offer of employment from Buyer, or (ii) who receives and rejects an offer of employment from Buyer, shall remain an employee of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) after the Closing, and Buyer shall have no further obligation or liability with respect to such person. 

  

 (f) At any time prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may designate any Investment Advisory Services Employee (as that term is defined in the Transition Services Agreement) (other than an Excluded Investment Employee) as a "Retained Employee." Any Investment Advisory Services Employee designated as a Retained Employee shall not be offered employment by Buyer, but Seller shall not terminate the employment of such Retained Employee without Buyers written consent prior to ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Buyer may provide any Retained Employee with a retention bonus, the terms of which shall be determined solely by Buyer, and Buyer shall be responsible for and liable for any such retention bonus payment. Retained Employees shall initially be identified by Buyer on the "Retained Employee List" to be provided to Seller within forty five (45) days after the date of this Agreement. The Retained Employee List shall be updated periodically prior to the Closing Date to reflect additional Retained Employees as identified by Buyer. 

  

 (g) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits, Buyer shall give, or cause the Acquired Companies to give, the Affected Employees full credit, for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, for the Affected Employees service with Sellers and their Affiliates to the same extent recognized by Sellers and their Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date. 

  

 (h) Affected Employees shall be eligible to participate in Buyers Severance Plans from and after the Closing Date on the same basis as similarly situated employees of the Buyer, and Buyer shall treat service with Sellers and the Acquired Companies as service with Buyer for purposes of administering Buyers Severance Plans. 

   Any changes Buyer makes to the schedule of severance pay under its Severance
Plans shall apply equally to Affected Employees and similarly situated
Buyer employees.

  

 (i) (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall be jointly and severally liable for and shall indemnify and hold Sellers, their officers, directors, employees, advisers, agents, representatives and Affiliates harmless from any and all Liabilities, damages, losses, claims, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including the enforcement of their rights under this paragraph) associated with the employment or termination of the employment of an Affected Employee in respect of any period on or following the Closing Date, including any claim by an Affected Employee which arises under federal, state or local statute (including, without limitation, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1990, the Equal Pay Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, ERISA and all other statutes regulating the terms and conditions of employment), regulation or ordinance, under the common law or in equity (including any claims for wrongful discharge or otherwise), or under any benefit plans or under any policy, agreement, understanding or promise, written, oral or implied, formal or informal, between a Buyer or Affiliate thereof and such Affected Employee. 

  

   (2)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, CIGNA and Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable for and shall indemnify and hold Buyer, the Acquired Companies, their officers, directors, employees, advisers, agents, representatives and Affiliates harmless from any and all Liabilities, damages, losses, claims, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including the enforcement of their rights under this paragraph) associated with the employment or termination of the employment of an Affected Employee in respect of any period preceding the Closing Date, including any claim by an Affected Employee which arises under federal, state or local statute (including, without limitation, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1990, the Equal Pay Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, ERISA and all other statutes regulating the terms and conditions of employment), regulation or ordinance, under the common law or in equity (including any claims for wrongful discharge or otherwise), or under any benefit plans or under any policy, agreement, understanding or promise, written, oral or implied, formal or informal, between the Sellers or an Affiliates thereof and such Affected Employee. Seller shall be liable for any payments under any of its Plans or Employment Agreements that would not be deductible under Code sections 162(m) or 280G or the Treasury Regulations pertaining to such sections. 

  

 (j) (1) _Replacement of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Grants_ : Buyer shall grant, or shall cause to be granted, under the terms of the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan"), the following equity compensation to each Affected Employee, as follows: 

      _Replacement of CIGNA Below-Market Options with Prudential Options_ :
For each Affected Employee with an outstanding award of nonqualified stock
options made under the terms of the CIGNA Corporation Stock Plan (the "CIGNA
Stock Plan") or the CIGNA Long-Term Incentive Plan ("CIGNA
LTIP") (collectively, the "CIGNA Stock Plans") as of the Closing Date,
where such options are: (i) either (v) unvested as of the Closing Date (and
would therefore be forfeited on the Closing Date by reason of the
Affected Employees termination of employment with Sellers on the Closing
under the CIGNA Stock Plans) or (w) vested as of the Closing Date, and, (ii)
in either case, have an exercise price on the Closing Date greater than
the twenty-business day trading average of CIGNA Corporation Common Stock on
the New York Stock Exchange 14 days prior to the Closing Date (the "20-Day
CIGNA Average") (such stock options referred to herein as the "CIGNA Below-
Market Options"), such CIGNA Below-Market Options shall be forfeited as of
the Closing Date and Buyer will thereafter grant nonqualified stock options
under the Omnibus Plan (the "Prudential Options") to replace such forfeited
CIGNA Below-Market Options.

  
---|---|--- 
   
       |   |

The number of Prudential Options granted to each such Affected Employee to
replace the forfeited CIGNA Below-Market Options shall be determined as
follows. First, the replacement value of the CIGNA Below-Market Options will
be calculated by Buyer under a Black-Scholes valuation methodology, generally
using the factors set forth in CIGNAs 2003 Notice of Annual Meeting and
Proxy Statement to value such option grants in fiscal year 2002 with certain
adjustments as determined by Buyer (the "CIGNA Below-Market Replacement
Value"). Second, the number of Prudential Options granted to each Affected
Employee will be calculated under the same methodology used by Buyer to
award option grant to Buyers employees under the Omnibus Plan  that is, the
number of Prudential Options per Affected Employee will be determined by
dividing the CIGNA Below-Market Replacement Value by one-third (1/3) of the
twenty (20) business day trading average of Prudential Financial, Inc. Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange 14 days prior to the date the Closing
Date occurs (the "20-Day Prudential Average").

  
---|---|--- 
   
       |   |

Buyer will provide that: (x) each such Prudential Option will be granted at
the "Fair Market Value" (as such term is defined under the Omnibus Plan) of
Prudential Financial, Inc. Common Stock on the date of grant; (y) that the
Prudential Options will have a term of ten (10) years and a three (3) year
vesting schedule (with one-third (1/3) of such grant vesting annually) from
the date of grant; and (z) to the degree applicable, the Prudential Options
will otherwise be subject to the ordinary terms and conditions of any
nonqualified stock option grant made under the Omnibus Plan.

  
---|---|--- 
   
      _Replacement of CIGNA Above-Market Options with Prudential Options
and Prudential Restricted Stock_ : For each Affected Employee with an
outstanding award of nonqualified stock options made under the terms of the
CIGNA Stock Plans as of the Closing Date where such options are (i) unvested
as of the Closing Date (and would therefore be forfeited by reason of the
Affected Employees termination of employment with Sellers on the Closing
Date under the terms of the CIGNA Stock Plans) and (ii) have an exercise
price on the Closing Date less than the 20-Day CIGNA Average (the "CIGNA
Above-Market Options"), such CIGNA Above-Market Options shall be forfeited as
of the Closing Date and Buyer will thereafter grant a number of shares of
Prudential Financial, Inc. restricted stock and nonqualified stock options
under the Omnibus Plan (the "Prudential Restricted Stock") to replace
such forfeited CIGNA Above-Market Options.

  
---|---|--- 
   
       |   |

The number of shares of restricted stock and stock options granted to each
such Affected Employee to replace the CIGNA Above-Market Options shall be
determined as follows. First, the replacement value of the CIGNA Above-Market
Options will be calculated by Buyer under a Black-Scholes valuation
methodology, generally using the factors set forth in CIGNAs 2003 Notice of
Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement to value such option grants in fiscal year
2002 with certain adjustments as determined by Buyer (the "CIGNA Above-
Market Replacement Value"). Second, the Buyer will determine for each
Affected Employee the sum of the difference between the 20-Day CIGNA Average
and the exercise price of all such Above-Market Options (the "CIGNA Intrinsic
Value"). Third, the CIGNA Intrinsic Value will be divided by the 20-day
Prudential Average to determine the number of shares of Prudential Financial,
Inc. restricted stock to be granted to the Affected Employee. Each award of
Prudential Restricted Stock will be subject to the usual terms and conditions
of any restricted stock grant made under the Omnibus Plan (including, but not
limited to, the standard three-year "cliff" vesting schedule on such awards
from the date of grant).

  
---|---|--- 
   
       |   |

The number of Prudential Options granted in recognition of the CIGNA Above-
Market Options will be determined as follows. First, the difference between
the CIGNA Above-Market Replacement Value and the CIGNA Intrinsic Value (the
"CIGNA Above-Market Remaining Value") will be determined for each Affected
Employee. Second, this value will be divided by one-third (1/3) of the 20-Day
Prudential Average to determine the number of Prudential Options to be
granted. Buyer will provide that: (x) each such Prudential Option will
be granted at the "Fair Market Value" (as such term is defined under the
Omnibus Plan) of Prudential Financial, Inc. Common Stock on the date of
grant; (y) that the Prudential Options

  
---|---|--- 
   
   will have a term of ten (10) years and a three (3) year vesting schedule
(with one-third (1/3) of such grant vesting annually) from the date of grant;
and (z) to the degree applicable, the Prudential Options will otherwise be
subject to the ordinary terms and conditions of any nonqualified stock option
grant made under the Omnibus Plan.

  
---|---|--- 
   
      c.  |   |

  _Replacement of CIGNA Restricted Stock Already Granted under the CIGNA
Stock Plans_ :

  
---|---|--- 
   
       |

For each Affected Employee with an outstanding award (as of the Closing Date)
of restricted stock (the "CIGNA Restricted Stock") granted under the CIGNA
Stock Plans, the Affected Employees shall forfeit such CIGNA Restricted Stock
shares under the terms of the CIGNA Stock Plans and Buyer will thereafter
grant to such Affected Employees restricted stock under the Omnibus Plan (the
"Prudential Restricted Stock").

  
---|--- 
   
       |

The number of shares of Prudential Restricted Stock granted to each Affected
Employee under the terms of this subsection will be determined as follows.
First, the number of outstanding shares of CIGNA Restricted Stock will be
multiplied by the 20-Day CIGNA Average to determine the value of the
forfeited Restricted Stock (the "CIGNA Restricted Stock Forfeited Value").
Second, this forfeited value will be divided by the 20-Day Prudential Average
to determine the number of shares of Prudential restricted stock to be
granted to such Affected Employee.

  
---|--- 
   
       |

Generally, each such award of Prudential Restricted Stock will be subject to
the ordinary terms and conditions of any other restricted stock award made
under the Omnibus Plan. However, with respect to any shares of Prudential
Restricted Stock intended to replace CIGNA Restricted Stock, the Buyer shall
apply the vesting schedule(s) of such CIGNA Restricted Stock awards that were
in effect for each such award as of the day prior to the Closing Date.

  
---|--- 
   
  

 (2)  _Treatment of SPUs under CIGNA LTIP_. With respect to any outstanding "strategic performance unit" ("SPU") awards for Affected Employees under the CIGNA LTIP that have not been paid out on or prior to the Closing Date: (a) Seller shall pro-rate for each Affected Employee the number of outstanding SPU awards based on the number of months of the performance period attributable to such awards up to the Closing Date and Seller thereafter make cash payments with respect to such pro-rated awards in the ordinary course to such Affected Employees at the same time and at the same manner as other Plan participants after the completion or termination of the respective performance cycles to which such awards are attributable, but only if such Affected Employee remains employed by the Buyer or an Affiliate on the date of such payment; and (b) Buyer shall 

    thereafter grant to each Affected Employee an award of Prudential Restricted
Stock with a value equal to the value of the difference between the number
of SPUs awarded to such Affected Employee and pro-rated portion for which
Seller is to make a cash payment under sub-Section (2)(a) above. In
calculating the value of the SPU awards, Buyer shall use the unit value of
each SPU award Seller uses for expense accrual purposes in the Sellers
financial statements for the quarter immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Seller shall provide the Buyer a letter stating the accrued unit values of
each outstanding SPU award as soon as practical following the close of
the quarter preceding the Closing Date. Generally, each such award of
Prudential Restricted Stock will be subject to the ordinary terms and
conditions of any other restricted stock award made under the Omnibus Plan.
However, with respect to any shares of Prudential Restricted Stock intended
to replace CIGNA LTIP awards, the Buyer shall apply the payout schedule of
such CIGNA LTIP awards as the vesting schedule for each such
Prudential Restricted Stock award.

  

 (3)  _Retention Awards_ : With respect to any payment due or owing under the terms of the various retention bonus program agreements set forth in Schedule 5.5(j)(3) to be made in the form of cash or CIGNA restricted stock units on or after the Closing Date (the "Retention Awards"), the provisions of this Section 5.5(j) with respect to the replacement of such awards shall not apply, and Seller shall be responsible for, and liable for, all such payments under the Retention Awards. Schedule 5.5(j)(3) shall not include retention bonuses described in Section 5.5(f) or retention bonuses provided for under the Transition Services Agreement. 

  

   (k) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to constitute or create a contract of employment between Buyers or its Affiliates and any Affected Employee. Nothing in this Agreement shall cause Buyer or its Affiliates to have any obligation to continue the employment of any Affected Employee for any particular period of time nor shall anything in this Agreement limit Buyers or its Affiliates right to terminate the employment of any Affected Employee. 

  

   (l) Sellers shall be responsible for providing or discharging any and all notifications, benefits and liabilities to employees and Governmental Entities required by the Sellers policy or practice, the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or under any other applicable Law relating to plant closings or employee separations or severance pay that are required to be provided before the Closing as a result of transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have sole responsibility for such notifications, benefits and liabilities with respect to any Affected Employees whose employment is terminated by the Buyer at or after the Closing. 

  

   (m) Sellers shall retain liability, and shall be responsible, for the payment of bonuses earned or accrued, consistent with past practice, as of the Closing Date, by Affected Employees. Sellers shall also retain liability, and shall be responsible, for the payment of accrued but unused vacation pay as of the Closing Date for Affected Employees. 

       (n)Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall withhold and pay all payroll, Social Security, and withholding Taxes due upon the exercise, vesting or forfeiture by Affected Employees of (1) restricted shares of CIGNA stock and (2) any options to purchase CIGNA stock. Seller shall promptly provide to Buyer information concerning the amount of all such payroll, Social Security, and withholding Taxes and the amount of gross wages reportable to any Taxing Authority in respect of such restricted stock and options.

5.6 _Cooperation Regarding Governmental Entities._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 The parties hereto shall (a) cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all the consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations and agreements of any Governmental Entities necessary to authorize, approve or permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; (b) as promptly as practicable, file, or cause to be filed or submitted to Governmental Entities all notices, applications, documents and other materials necessary in connection with the consummation of such transactions, including amendments of disclosure documents applicable to the Subject Contracts to the extent required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, such amendments to be mutually agreed upon by the parties and (c) use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from all Governmental Entities for additional information or documentation in connection with such transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be obligated to take or refrain from taking or to agree to take or refrain from taking any action or to suffer to exist any restriction or requirement which would, individually or together with all other such actions, restrictions or requirements, reasonably be expected to result in (i) a Buyer Negative Condition, (ii) in the case of Buyer, a material negative effect on the Business, taken as a whole, or (iii) in the case of either party, a material negative effect on the benefits, taken as a whole, which such party could otherwise reasonably expect to derive from consummation of the Transaction had such party not been obligated to take or refrain from taking or to agree to take or refrain from taking such action or suffer to exist such restriction or requirement (each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), excluding the effects of any conditions, restrictions or requirements (1) to the extent such party reasonably should expect as of the date of this Agreement that such conditions, restrictions or other requirements would be reasonably likely to be imposed by a Governmental Entity, and (2) that are, individually and in the aggregate with all other such conditions, restrictions and other requirements under (1), not material in their impact on the cash flow and expected returns of the Business to such Party (other than any such impact arising from the restrictions set forth in § 38a-136(i)(2) of the Connecticut General Statutes) (relating to temporary post-change in control limitations on certain actions), a "Material Negative Condition"). Sellers shall commence filing for regulatory approval for the assumption and novation of the Subject Contracts contemplated under Article VIII of the Coinsurance Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and otherwise take such action as it reasonably requested by

    Buyer to facilitate the novation of the Subject Contracts (in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Business Coinsurance Agreements) as soon as
reasonably practicable. Sellers and Buyer shall furnish to each other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of all necessary
filings or submissions to any Governmental Entity. Subject to Section 2.7(b),
(i) Sellers and Buyer shall provide each other with draft copies and as-filed
copies of all filings and submissions with Governmental Entities and shall
provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to comment upon all such
draft copies and (ii) Sellers and Buyer agree that, to the extent feasible
and subject to Section 2.7(b), all substantive meetings with any
Governmental Entity (whether in person, by telephone or other means of
instantaneous communication) regarding the transactions contemplated hereby
or by the Ancillary Agreements shall include representatives of Sellers and
Buyer unless such parties jointly decide otherwise.

     Section   |   |

5.7 _Cooperation Regarding Other Third Parties._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a) From and after the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite contractholder, certificate holder and sponsor consents for the novation of General Account Subject Contracts and Separate Account Subject Contracts. Each party hereto shall bear its respective costs and expenses with respect to such efforts. 

  

 (b) From the date of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all other approvals, consents and waivers of non-governmental Persons to the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements (other than the consents referred to in Section 5.7(a)). In the event and to the extent that the parties hereto are unable to obtain prior to the Closing Date any such required approval, consent or waiver in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements of a non-governmental Person that is a party to any agreement, lease, sublease (to or by Sellers) or license to which an Acquired Company is a party or which otherwise constitutes part of the Transferred Assets (but which are not treated as Excluded Assets pursuant to Sections 5.25 or 5.28), (i) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts in cooperation with Buyer to (x) provide or cause to be provided to Buyer the benefits of any such agreement, lease, sublease (to or by Sellers) or license, (y) cooperate in any arrangement, reasonable and lawful, designed to provide such benefits to Buyer and (z) enforce for the account of Buyer any rights of the Acquired Companies or the Business arising from such agreements, leases, subleases (to or by Sellers) and licenses which Buyer directs in writing to be taken and for which Buyer fully indemnifies Sellers and (ii) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the obligations of the Acquired Companies or the Business arising under such agreements, leases, subleases (to or by Sellers) and licenses, to the extent that, by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer or its subsidiaries has control over the resources necessary to perform such obligations. If and when any such approval or consent shall be obtained subsequent to the Closing Date or such agreement, lease, sublease (to or by Sellers) or license shall otherwise 

    become assignable subsequent to the Closing Date, Sellers and
their Affiliates shall promptly assign all of their rights and obligations
thereunder which relate to the Acquired Companies or the Business to Buyer
or, at Buyers direction, an Affiliate of Buyer without the payment of
further consideration and Buyer shall, without the payment of any further
consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations and Sellers and
their Affiliates shall be relieved of any and all obligations and future
Liabilities hereunder and thereunder accruing from and after the date of the
assignment and assumption, other than Excluded Liabilities. Without limiting
the foregoing, in the event an approval, consent or waiver has not
been obtained by the Closing Date, then, at Buyers sole option, Sellers and
their Affiliates will provide Buyer and its Affiliates with rights and/or
access to the benefits provided under any such Contract for which an
approval, consent or waiver has not been obtained or substantially equivalent
rights and/or access in all material respects as a Transition Service
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

  

 (c) The costs of obtaining any such approvals, consents and waivers described in Section 5.7(b) (including attorneys fees, but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including service and licensing fees, incremental charges, revised terms or similar costs relating to the services to be provided, in each case to the extent arising in the ordinary course of business and to the extent not reasonably construed to have been requested in exchange for obtaining such approvals, consents and waivers which costs shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer and its Affiliates) shall be shared equally by Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand; provided, however, that the portion of the costs borne by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.7(c), the portion of the Transfer Taxes and costs borne by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.13, the portion of the costs and penalties borne by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.25 and 5.28 and the portion of the costs borne by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3(h) of the Transition Services Agreement shall in the aggregate not exceed $9 million, and Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any such costs incurred by Buyer in excess of $9 million. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary in the event that any party to a Lease (other than Sellers or their Affiliates) requires any guarantee or similar covenant, instrument or agreement relating to future performance or payment in connection with the assignment of any Lease to CIGNA Life, Buyer or any of its Affiliates contemplated hereby or by any Ancillary Agreement, Sellers and their Affiliates shall be under no obligation to provide such guarantee or similar covenant, instrument or agreement, and Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide any such guarantee or similar covenant or agreement. 

     Section   |   |

5.8 _Exclusivity._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a)From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, Sellers will not, and shall cause their respective officers, employees, representatives, advisers, agents and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage, facilitate or initiate any inquiries or the making of any proposals or offers from, engage in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any information or data to, or otherwise cooperate 

      in any manner with, any Person or group of Persons (other than Buyer and its
Affiliates) concerning any direct or indirect sale or other disposition of,
or merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving, all or any portion of the Business, the Acquired Companies, the
Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Subject Contracts. Sellers
shall, and shall cause their respective officers, employees, representatives,
advisers, agents and Affiliates to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.
Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer if any such inquiries, proposals or
offers are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such
negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with or
about the Business, the Acquired Companies, the Transferred Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Subject Contracts and shall promptly request each
Person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of acquiring the Business, the Acquired Companies,
the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Subject Contracts to
return or destroy in accordance with the applicable confidentiality
agreement, all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person
by or on behalf of the Sellers.

  

 (b)From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates will take, or agree or commit to take, any action for the purpose of impeding the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. 

     Section   |   |

5.9 _Investigation; Maintenance of Marketplace Relationships._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall give to Buyer and its employees and representatives reasonable access to the Books and Records and the facilities, systems and employees of or relating to the Business, the Acquired Companies, CGLIC, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Investment Assets, the Assigned and Assumed Contracts, the Assumed Liabilities and the Subject Contracts, shall make available to Buyer and its employees and representatives for copying and duplication purposes all Books and Records as they shall reasonably request, and shall cooperate with Buyer and its employees and representatives in their making such further investigation of the assets, Liabilities, business operations, facilities, systems, employees and representatives and business plans of the Business, the Acquired Companies, CGLIC, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Investment Assets, the Assigned and Assumed Contracts, the Assumed Liabilities and the Subject Contracts. Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, Sellers shall give to Buyer and its employees and representatives access to representatives, customers, clients, producers and consultants of the Business, the Acquired Companies and CGLIC (to the extent relating to the Business), including written, telephonic and in-person communications for the purpose of facilitating the retention of such persons by the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) all such written communications, meetings and telephonic communications that include a representative of the Business shall be subject to the prior consent (obtained in accordance with the protocols set forth on Schedule 5.9(a)) of Sellers (such consent not to 

      be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (ii) all such meetings
and telephonic communications that do not include a representative of the
Business shall be subject to the prior written consent (obtained in
accordance with the protocols set forth on Schedule 5.9(a)) of Sellers. Any
investigation, examination or interview by Buyer of employees or
representatives or access pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section
5.9(a) shall be conducted or occur at reasonable times during
regular business hours upon reasonable prior written notice in a manner which
does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of Sellers or
their Affiliates (or any of their successors). Each of the parties hereto and
its employees, representatives and advisers, including, without limitation,
counsel, investment bankers and independent public accountants, shall
cooperate with the others employees, representatives and advisers, as the
case may be, in connection with such review and examination. Any such
investigation, examination or interview shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation made pursuant
to this Section 5.9 or otherwise, whether made before or after the date of
this Agreement, shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any specific
representation or warranty made by either party pursuant to this Agreement or
any rights of the parties under Article VII.

  

 (b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, (i) Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to keep available the services of its and their current officers and employees, and to preserve its relationships with customers, clients, producers and consultants and others having material business dealings with any of Sellers, their Affiliates or the Acquired Companies relating to the Business, (ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Sellers and their Affiliates regarding the foregoing; and (iii) Sellers and Buyers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to outline, refine, plan for and commence the transition processes contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement as reasonably practicable, including, without limitation, by supplementing TSA Schedule 1 with additional qualifying services identified by Sellers or Buyer and desired by Buyer to be received pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, and by identifying services and their associated costs with specificity sufficient to disclose how such costs will be prorated in the event that Buyer does not use, or terminates, services or portions thereof. 

     Section   |   |

5.10 _Post-Closing Access._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a) Following the Closing Date, Sellers and their Affiliates shall (i) allow the employees, representatives and advisers of Buyer and its Affiliates, upon reasonable prior notice and during regular business hours, the right, at Buyers expense, to examine and make copies of any Books and Records (including any items within the definition of Books and Records developed by Sellers following the Closing Date to extent relating to the Business) which were retained by Sellers or any of their Affiliates and to have access to the employees, their respective businesses or of Sellers or any of their Affiliates for any reasonable purpose relating to the Business, including, without limitation, disputes under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the preparation or examination of Buyers Tax Returns, review and diligence of Data Input Inaccuracies, 

      regulatory filings and financial statements and the conduct of any litigation
(as opposed to any other form of dispute resolution) with a third
party (whether or not the subject of an indemnification claim by a Buyer
Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee) or regulatory dispute (whether or not the
subject of an indemnification claim by a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller
Indemnitee), whether pending or threatened, concerning the conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) maintain such Books and Records
(including any items within the definition of Books and Records developed by
Sellers following the Closing Date to extent relating to the Business) for
Buyers examination and copying for a period of not less than eight years
following the Closing Date. Access to such Books and Records (including any

5.19 _Tax Matters._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a) Sellers shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be filed) when due (including extensions) (i) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Acquired Companies for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Period"), and (ii) all consolidated, combined, unitary, and similar Tax Returns that include one or more of the Acquired Companies and any of Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies). To the extent permitted under Applicable Law, Buyer and Sellers shall cause each Acquired Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of such entitys taxable year. 

  

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.19(a), Buyer shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be filed) when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Acquired Companies for taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing Period") and any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"). 

  

 (c) Buyer shall make available to Sellers for inspection any Tax Returns required to be prepared by Buyer for any taxable year or period that includes a Straddle Period and Sellers shall make available to Buyer for inspection any Tax Returns required to be prepared by Sellers pursuant to Section 5.19(a); provided, however, any inspection by Buyer or Sellers shall be permitted only for the portion of, and to the extent that, the Tax Returns relate to the Business. Each party (the "Preparer") shall, if reasonably practicable, make such Tax Returns available to such other party, or parties, (the "Reviewer") a reasonable amount of time prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax Returns and if any such Tax Return is not provided to Reviewer in a reasonable amount of time prior to the due date for filing that Tax Return, a draft of such Tax Return shall be provided. If a draft of a Tax Return has been provided pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Preparer shall provide the Reviewer with the final Tax Return as soon as is practicable, together with a schedule indicating any changes from the draft Tax Return. If the Reviewer has any dispute regarding any such Tax Return as presented by the Preparer, then such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the Preparer, and the Reviewer shall be entitled to initiate a dispute under Section 5.19(q) hereof. A Reviewer can, at any time, waive its rights, as described herein, to inspect all, or any portion of, any Tax Return. Any such waiver will have no effect on the parties indemnification obligations pursuant to this Section 5.19. 

  

 (d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid (including, in the case of amounts paid prior to the Closing Date, 

      payments by the Acquired Companies), on a timely basis, all Taxes due with
respect to the Tax liability of the Acquired Companies for Pre-Closing Periods
and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. Sellers
shall pay directly to or at the direction of Buyer, at least three (3) days
prior to the date payment thereof is due, the portion of such Taxes for that
portion of any Straddle Period which ends on the Closing Date (calculated
pursuant to Section 5.19(e)). Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid (including
payments by the Acquired Companies), on a timely basis, all Taxes due with
respect to the Tax liability of the Acquired Companies for Post-Closing
Periods and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning on the day after the
Closing Date.

  

 (e) In the case of any Straddle Period: 

      (i)  |   |

 The periodic Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are not based in whole or
in part on income or receipts (e.g., property Taxes) for the portion of
any Straddle Period which ends on the Closing Date shall be computed based on
the ratio of the number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period and
the number of days in the entire taxable period, and the periodic Taxes of
the Acquired Companies that are not based in whole or in part on income or
receipts for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning on the day after
the Closing Date shall be computed based on the ratio of the number of days
in such portion of the Straddle Period and the number of days in the entire
taxable period.

  
---|---|--- 
   
      (ii)  |   |

 The Taxes of the Acquired Companies for that portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date (other than Taxes described in Section
5.19(e)(i)), shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, and the Taxes of the
Acquired Companies for that portion of any Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date (other than Taxes described in Section 5.19(e)(i)), shall be
computed as if such taxable period began on the day after the Closing Date, 
_provided_ that, for purposes of this clause (ii), if the total Tax for
any Straddle Period does not equal the sum of the positive amounts of Tax in
respect of such portions thereof, then the parties shall adjust such amounts
in a fair and reasonable manner.

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (f) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns or any carryback filing), that relate to any taxable period, or portion thereof, for which any Seller is liable pursuant to Section 5.19(d), except to the extent that such refund or use of such credit against Tax relates to Taxes for which the liability is assumed by Buyer, shall be for the account of Sellers, and Buyer shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit within ten (10) days after receipt of such refund or use of such credit. Buyer shall pay Sellers interest at the rate prescribed under section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded daily, on any amount not paid when due under this Section 5.19(f). 

  

 (g) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by Sellers or any of their Affiliates, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Sellers or any of their Affiliates becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns or any carryback filing), that relate to any taxable period, or portion thereof, for which Buyer is liable pursuant to Section 5.19(d), or that relate to any Tax for which the liability is assumed by Buyer, shall be for the account of Buyer, and Sellers shall pay over to Buyer any such refund or the amount of any such credit within ten (10) days after receipt of such refund or use of such credit. Sellers shall pay Buyer interest at the rate prescribed under section 6621(a)(1) of 

    the Code, compounded daily, on any amount not paid when due under
this Section 5.19(g).

  

 (h) Each Seller and Buyer shall cooperate, and cause each of its Affiliates to cooperate, to the extent not harmed, in obtaining any Tax refund that the other party reasonably believes should be available, including through filing appropriate forms with the applicable Tax Authority. 

  

 (i) For each "reportable transaction" (as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)), if any, that any of the Acquired Companies, or to the extent it relates, in whole or in part, to the Business, Sellers has "participated in" (as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(c)(3)) and filed an Internal Revenue Service Form 8886 (or any successor form), Sellers will provide as soon as reasonably practicable a true and complete copy of each such form as such form was filed. 

  

 (j) Except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, after the Closing Date, each Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts in the ordinary course of its business (and shall cause its respective Affiliates to do the same) to (i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 5.19(a) or Section 5.19(b), and (ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with, any Tax Authority regarding any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies or, to the extent it relates, in whole or in part, to the Business, Sellers. In connection therewith, Buyer shall not dispose of any Tax Books or Records of the Acquired Companies or, to the extent it relates, in whole or in part, to the Business, Sellers during the eight-year period following the Closing Date, and thereafter shall give Sellers reasonable written notice, and the opportunity to make copies of any such items, before disposing of such items. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of this section 5.19(j) and any provision in the Transition Services Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement shall control. 

     (k) Contests. 

      (i)  |   |

 After the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers each shall notify the other party
in writing within ten (10) days of notice of (or, if there is no such notice,
the commencement of) any Tax audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding affecting the Taxes of the Acquired Companies, Sellers, Buyer or
their respective Affiliates (a "Tax Audit") the resolution of which
would reasonably be expected to result in a material increase in Tax
liability for which the other party would be liable under the terms of this
Agreement. Such notice shall contain factual information describing any
asserted Tax liabilities in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any
notice or other document received from any Tax Authority in respect of any
such asserted Tax liabilities.

  
---|---|--- 
   
      (ii)  |   |

 In the case of any Tax Audit (or, if separable, any portion thereof)
solely involving Taxes for which one party is liable under the terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, such party (the "Controlling Party") shall have
the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such Tax Audit (or,
if separable, any portion thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
other party (the "Participating Party") shall have the right, at
its expense, to participate in any such Tax Audit (or portion thereof) to the
extent that its resolution would reasonably be expected to result in an
increase in Tax liability for which the Participating Party is liable under
the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. In the event that either party
exercises its right to participate in any Tax Audit (or portion thereof), as
described above, the Controlling Party shall not settle such Tax Audit (or
portion thereof) without the prior written consent of the Participating
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Controlling Party shall be entitled to settle any
portion of such Tax Audit so long as (a) such portion is separable from the
remainder of the Tax Audit and (b) such resolution would not reasonably be
expected to result in an increase in Tax liability for which the
Participating Party is liable under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise.

  
---|---|--- 
   
      (iii)  |   |

 In the case of any Tax Audit (or portion thereof) not described in clause
(ii), the party in whose name, or in the name of whose Affiliate(s), such Tax
Audit is being contested shall have the right, at its expense, to control the
conduct of such Tax Audit (or portion thereof); _provided_ , however, that
such party shall not settle such Tax Audit (or portion thereof) without the
prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  
---|---|--- 
   
     (l)  _Tax Indemnity_. 

      (i)  |   |

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against
any and all (A) Taxes imposed on, or required to be withheld by, the Acquired
Companies, Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period; (B) Taxes imposed on, or required to be withheld by, the Acquired
Companies, Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to the portion of any
Straddle Period ending at the end of the day on the Closing Date; and (C)
Taxes, expenses or other losses incurred as a result of any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.11 (in
each case, determined without regard to any qualifications or references to
"material" or any other materiality qualifications or references contained in
any specific representation or warranty, except for such qualifications or
references in Section 3.11(g)), or arising out of the failure of Sellers or
their Affiliates, to perform any of the agreements they are required to
perform under this Section 5.19 or Section 5.13. Sellers shall pay to Buyer
any Tax indemnity required to be paid pursuant to the preceding sentence
within ten (10) days of Sellers receipt of a written request therefor from
Buyer describing in reasonable detail the indemnified Taxes which are the
subject of and basis for such Tax indemnity and the computation of the amount
so payable; provided, that if indemnified Taxes are being contested in
accordance with Section 5.19(k), Sellers shall pay any required Tax indemnity
to Buyer within ten (10) days of final resolution of such contest.

  
---|---|--- 
   
      (ii)  |   |

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates from and
against any and all (A) Taxes imposed on, or required to be withheld by, the
Acquired Companies, Buyer or its Affiliates, with respect to any Post-Closing
Period; (B) Taxes imposed on, or required to be withheld by, the Acquired
Companies, Buyer or its Affiliates, with respect to the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning the day after the Closing Date; and (C) Taxes,
expenses or other losses arising out of the failure of Buyer or its
Affiliates to perform any of the agreements they are required to perform
under this Section 5.19 or Section 5.13. Buyer shall pay to Sellers any Tax
indemnity required to be paid pursuant to the preceding sentence within ten
(10) days of Buyers receipt of a written request therefor from Sellers
describing in reasonable detail the indemnified Taxes which are the subject
of and basis for such Tax indemnity and the computation of the amount so
payable; provided, that if indemnified Taxes are being contested in
accordance with Section 5.19(k), Buyer shall pay any required Tax indemnity
to Sellers within ten days of final resolution of such contest.

  
---|---|--- 
   
      (m) Buyer shall not take, or cause or permit the Acquired Companies to take, any action, with respect to the taxable year or period of Buyer, the Acquired Companies, or any of their Affiliates, as applicable, which includes the Closing Date, which would be reasonably likely to increase Sellers or any of their Affiliates liability for Taxes (including any liability of Sellers to indemnify Buyer for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement) including, for example, any action (including the making of any elections) that would be reasonably likely to result in, or change the character of, any income or gain that any Seller or Affiliate of a Seller must report on any Tax Return. 

  

 (n) Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor any of the Sellers, on the other hand, (in any event, the "Amending Party") shall (or shall cause or permit any of its respective Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return that would reasonably be expected to result in a material increase in Tax liability for which any party to this Agreement that is not an Affiliate of the Amending Party (the "Non-Amending Party") is liable under the terms of this Agreement relating in whole or in part to the Acquired Companies with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of such Non-Amending Party, which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion; provided, however, that no consent shall be required if the Amending Party agrees to indemnify the Non-Amending Party for any resulting increase in its liability for Taxes under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 (o) Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law, none of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit the Acquired Companies to) carry back for federal, state, local or foreign tax purposes to any taxable period, or portion thereof, of the Acquired Companies, ending on or before, or which includes, the Closing Date any net operating losses, capital losses, tax credits or similar items arising in, resulting from, or generated in connection with a taxable year of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, or portion thereof, ending after the Closing Date. 

  

 (p) Sellers agree to join with Buyer in making timely and irrevocable joint elections under section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding elections under state or local tax law, with respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of the Acquired Companies identified in Schedule 5.19(p)(i) (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). Sellers further agree and understand that Buyer intends to make timely elections under section 338(g) of the Code and any corresponding elections under state or local tax law, with respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of the Acquired Companies identified in Schedule 5.19(p)(ii). 

  

 (q) Any claim, controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to Section 5.19 or otherwise relating to Taxes, on which an amicable understanding cannot be reached, shall be submitted to and resolved by arbitration. Such arbitration shall be conducted expeditiously and confidentially. In such arbitration, the arbitrators may not award any consequential, punitive or exemplary damages or any damages other than compensatory damages. To initiate arbitration, a party shall notify the other party in 

      writing of its desire to arbitrate, stating the nature of its dispute and the
remedy sought. The receiving party shall acknowledge receipt of the notice
in writing within five days of such receipt, and thereafter the parties shall
attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of the
date of such acknowledgment. If the dispute cannot be resolved within such
thirty (30) day period, any party may send a written demand for arbitration
to the other party. Within thirty (30) days of delivery of such demand for
arbitration, the parties shall appoint by mutual agreement an arbitrator who
is a nationally-recognized Tax lawyer at a nationally recognized accounting
firm or law firm; provided, however, if the parties cannot mutually agree on
an arbitrator, the parties independent accounting firms will appoint a
neutral nationally-recognized Tax lawyer at a nationally
recognized accounting firm or law firm as arbitrator. Any award rendered by
the arbitrator shall be accompanied by a written opinion setting forth the
findings of fact and conclusions of law relied upon in reaching the decision.
The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and non-
appealable, and judgment upon such award may be entered by any court having
jurisdiction thereof. The parties agree that the existence, conduct and
content of any such arbitration shall be kept confidential and no party
shall disclose to any Person any information about such arbitration, except
as may be required by Applicable Law or for financial reporting purposes in
each partys financial statements. The costs, fees and expenses of
arbitration shall be borne by the party that does not prevail in substantial
part as determined by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all time
periods in this Section 5.19(q) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be
reduced or eliminated and the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
any dispute, or allow for arbitration on an accelerated basis in respect of
such dispute, if and to the extent that the dispute relates to a Tax Return
that (i) has not yet been filed and (ii) the due date (including extensions)
for which would be likely to otherwise prevent such resolutions being
reflected on the Tax Return as, and when, initially filed.

  

 (r) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of Section 5.19 shall survive for ninety (90) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (giving effect to any waivers, mitigations or extensions thereof). 

  

 (s) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, indemnification claims with regard to Taxes (including with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.11, but not including those contained in Section 3.21) or otherwise brought pursuant to this Section 5.19 shall be governed exclusively by this Section 5.19; _provided_ , _however_ , if there is a failure of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.21 and the subject matter of such failure becomes the subject matter of a contest, claim, audit or similar proceeding initiated by a Tax Authority against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), then such proceeding and Sellers indemnification obligations, if any, with respect thereto shall be governed in all respects by the provisions of this Section 5.19, and, to the extent governed by this Section 5.19, for purposes of the survival periods of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 7.2, such

    representation or warranty shall be treated as a representation or warranty
set forth in Section 3.11.

  

 (t) In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of this Section 5.19 and any other provision in this Agreement, this Section 5.19 shall control.

 (b) Seller-Licensed Intellectual Property (including desktop, call center, distributed datacenter or other software applications) shall be included within the scope of the license grant set forth in this Section 5.26 only if and to the extent that: (i) such Seller-Licensed Intellectual Property is necessary to support directly or indirectly the customer, supplier or other similar transactions of the Business (including without limitation operations, systems management, optimization, troubleshooting and diagnostics), and (ii) Buyer does not itself own and cannot license from a third Person (which Person shall not in any event derive its rights (directly or indirectly) from Sellers or their Affiliates) on commercially reasonable terms a generally commercially available, substantially equal substitute without the need for material customization. Without limitation, a software application automatically shall be deemed "necessary" for purposes of this Section 5.26 if Buyer must pay more than $150,000 to acquire such substantially equal substitute or if Buyer has paid $700,000 in the aggregate to acquire such substantially equal substitutes. 

  

 (c) On or before the end of the Transition Period (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement), the Sellers must deliver to Buyer the Seller-Licensed Intellectual Property (including without limitation fully commented source code, data structures and user manuals if and as available) in the form or format in which they are available. Buyer at its option may choose the form and format if multiple forms and formats are available.

Buyer also 

    may sublicense all or any portion of the rights licensed to Buyer pursuant to
this Section 5.26 to Buyers and its Affiliates (i) customers, clients and
other end-users in the ordinary course of Business (except that
computer software source code may not be provided to such end-users); and
(ii) subcontractors and consultants, provided that to the extent that Seller-
Licensed Intellectual Property which is Confidential Information (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement) will be shared, it will only be shared with
those subcontractors and consultants who reasonably require access to assist
Buyer and its Affiliates in using their rights licensed pursuant to this
Section 5.26 and who have agreed to be bound by non-disclosure
and confidentiality agreements at least substantially as protective as
Buyers analogous obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

      any Governmental Entity or (iii) that use of such information is necessary or
appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent required for
the consummation of the Transaction, and Sellers shall instruct their

The foregoing proviso shall not apply to any Contract or service under a Contract 

    to the extent that the benefit of such Contract or service is

Buyer shall treat such Contract pursuant to clause (a) or clause (b) of the
second sentence of this Section 5.28. Any such Contract for which Buyer fails
to notify Sellers in accordance with the previous sentence shall be treated
as an Excluded Asset and all Liabilities related thereto as Excluded
Liabilities. Sellers and their Affiliates shall take such actions, execute
such instruments and otherwise cooperate with Buyer to the extent
reasonably necessary to give effect to any such election by Buyer and its
Affiliates.

survive indefinitely.

     Section   |   |

7.3 _Obligation to Indemnify._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII and in the Ancillary Agreements with respect to such agreements, Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") following the Closing from and against all Losses (as hereinafter defined), arising out of or resulting from: (i) the failure of any representations and warranties contained in Article III hereof to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date (after giving effect to the Restructuring) (except with respect to such representations or warranties which are made expressly as of a specified date or period, as to which indemnification hereunder shall be made only to the extent of the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct as of such specified date or period), determined without regard to any qualifications or references to "Seller Material Adverse Effect" contained in any specific representation or warranty (other than the representation contained in clause (b) of the first paragraph of Section 3.9), (ii) any breach, violation or non-fulfillment of any of the covenants and agreements of Sellers contained in this Agreement, the Bill of Sale or the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and (iii) all of the Excluded Liabilities. As used in this Article VII, "Loss" and "Losses" mean all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including out-of-pocket costs of investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts fees and expenses and costs and expenses relating to corrective or remedial actions), subject to the reduction specified in Section 7.3(d). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that (A) indemnification for consequential damages and diminution in value is permitted under this Section 7.3 and that the party defending any claim for such damages is permitted to contest the appropriateness of such damages on any specific claim and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for punitive or exemplary damages for which a valid indemnification claim is made hereunder only to the extent paid to a Third Party Claimant or Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Loss arising out of or resulting from breach of a representation or warranty to the extent Buyer Indemnitees would be entitled to indemnification for such Loss under clause (iii) of the first sentence of Section 7.3(a) and there is no impediment to collection; and (y) Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Loss constituting the Assumed Portion of the Eligible Liabilities. 

  

 (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII, Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their respective directors, officers, 

      employees, Affiliates, successors, permitted assigns, advisors, agents and
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") following
the Closing from and against all Losses arising out of or resulting from: (i)
the failure of any representations and warranties contained in Article III
hereof to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or the Closing
Date (except with respect to such representations or warranties which are
made expressly as of a specified date or period, as to which indemnification
hereunder shall be made only to the extent of the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct as of such specified
date or period), determined without regard to any qualifications or
references to "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" contained in any specific
representation or warranty; (ii) any breach, violation or non-fulfillment of
any of the covenants and agreements of Buyer, or the Acquired Companies (with
respect to post-Closing matters), contained in this Agreement, the Bill of
Sale or the Assignment and Assumption Agreement; (iii) all of the Assumed
Liabilities and Acquired Companies Liabilities; and (iv) Post-Closing
Business Liabilities.

  

 (c) The aggregate amount for which Sellers shall be liable under Section 7.3(a)(i) hereof shall in no event exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the Purchase Price. The aggregate amount for which Buyer shall be liable under Section 7.3(b)(i) hereof shall in no event exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the Purchase Price. Sellers shall be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) hereof only if aggregate Losses incurred by Buyer Indemnitees in connection with Section 7.3(a)(i) plus the amount of any Adjustment Amount determined pursuant to Section 2.11(d) exceed $25,000,000 (provided that such limitation on Sellers duty to indemnify Buyer Indemnities shall not apply to Losses related to any of Section 3.1(a), Section 3.2, Section 3.5, Section 3.6(b) or Section 3.17), and, in such event, indemnification shall be made by Sellers with respect to all such Losses plus the amount of any Adjustment Amount determined pursuant Section 2.11(d) to the extent such Losses exceed $12,500,000 (the "Deductible"). Buyer shall be required to indemnify Seller Indemnitees pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(i) when and only if aggregate Losses incurred by Seller Indemnitees in connection with such clauses exceeds $25,000,000 and, in such event, indemnification shall be made by Buyer with respect to all such Losses to the extent such Losses exceed $12,500,000. 

  

 (d) The amount of any Losses sustained by the Indemnified Party (as defined in Section 7.4) shall be reduced by any amount actually received by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto under any insurance coverage or from any other parties alleged to be responsible therefor. The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage and from such other parties. If the Indemnified Party receives an amount under insurance coverage or from such other parties alleged to have responsibility with respect to Losses sustained at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided pursuant to this Section 7.3, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnifying Party (as defined in Section 7.4) for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification up to such amount received by 

     the Indemnified Party, as applicable, after deducting therefrom the
full amount of any expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery.
Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Ancillary Agreement to the
contrary, the amount of any Losses shall also be reduced to the extent that
the Indemnified Party is compensated for such Losses by a third party (not
acting on behalf of Sellers) and other than pursuant to this Article VII.

  

 (e) The Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party only for those claims involving Losses under Section 7.3(a)(i) or Section 7.3(b)(i) as to which the Indemnified Party has given the Indemnifying Party written notice prior to sixty (60) days following the expiration date of the relevant representation and warranty as set forth in Section 7.2. 

  

 (f) (i) For claims involving Excluded Liabilities, Sellers, as the Indemnifying Party, will upon making any indemnification payment and to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party (excluding Buyer Indemnitees corporate insurance carriers) in respect of the Loss to which the payment relates, provided that Sellers or any of the Acquired Companies would have had the right to assert the claim prior to the Closing had such claim arisen prior to the Closing. Sellers decisions relative to whether to pursue a particular subrogation right shall be made consistent with decisions they made when they owned the Business (or, with respect to matters of first impression, consistent with the decisions they would make in a commercially reasonable manner if they continued to own the Business). Buyer, at its option and at its own expense, may participate in any Action, claim or demand subject to this paragraph (ii) through representatives and additional counsel of its own choosing. 

  

   (ii) For claims involving Assumed Liabilities, Buyer, as the Indemnifying Party, will upon making any indemnification payment and to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party (except with respect to Sellers self-insurance programs) in respect of the Loss to which the payment relates. Sellers, at their option and at their own expense, may participate in any Action, claim or demand subject to this paragraph (ii) through representatives and additional counsel of their own choosing. 

  

 (g) The provisions of this Article VII shall not apply to Taxes relating to the Business (including the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.11, but not those contained in Section 3.21), which shall be governed by Section 5.19: provided, however, if there is a failure of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.21 and the subject matter of such failure becomes the subject matter of a contest, claim, audit or similar proceeding initiated by a Tax Authority against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), then such proceeding and Sellers indemnification obligations, if any, with respect thereto shall be governed in all respects by the provisions of Section 5.19, and, to the extent governed by Section 5.19, for purposes of the survival periods of the representations and warranties set forth in 

      Section 7.2, such representation or warranty shall be treated as
a representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.11.

     Section   |   |

7.4 _Claims Notice._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 In the event that either a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee wishes to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder (other than a Claim based on an Asserted Liability), such party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall, as promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of the claim and entitlement to assert indemnification therefor, deliver written notice (such notice or the notice described in Section 7.5, a "Claims Notice") to the party from whom indemnification is claimed (the "Indemnifying Party"), specifying in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for and the amount of the claim asserted. Failure to deliver a Claims Notice with respect to a claim in a timely manner as specified in the preceding sentence shall not be deemed a waiver of the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection with such claim, but the amount of reimbursement to which the Indemnified Party is entitled shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Indemnified Partys Losses would have been less had such Claims Notice been timely delivered. 

     Section   |

7.5 _Right to Contest Claims of Third Parties._

  
---|--- 
   
  

 (a) If an Indemnified Party asserts a claim for indemnification hereunder because of a claim or demand made, or an action, proceeding or investigation instituted, by any Person not a party to this Agreement (a "Third Party Claimant") that may result in a Loss with respect to which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII (an "Asserted Liability"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a Claims Notice with respect thereto, which Claims Notice shall be delivered as promptly as is reasonably practicable after such Asserted Liability is actually known to the Indemnified Party. Failure to deliver a Claims Notice with respect to a claim in a timely manner as specified in the preceding sentence shall not be deemed a waiver of the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection with such claim, but the amount of reimbursement to which the Indemnified Party is entitled shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Indemnified Partys Losses would have been less had such Claims Notice been timely delivered. 

  

 (b) Subject to Sections 7.5(e), (f) and (g) below, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, through representatives and counsel of its own choosing, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest, defend or settle any Asserted Liability that may result in a Loss with respect to which the Indemnifying Party has irrevocably acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its indemnification obligation pursuant to this Article VII; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party may, at its option and at its own expense, Participate Fully (as defined below) in the investigation, 

   contesting, defense and settlement of any such Asserted Liability through
representatives and counsel of its own choosing. The Indemnifying Party
shall not settle any Asserted Liability unless: (i) the terms of such
settlement call only for a payment by the Indemnifying Party; and do not
involve any admission or finding of any violation of Applicable Law by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, or the imposition of equitable remedies
on the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, or the imposition of any other
obligation or limitation on the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates; or (ii)
the Indemnified Party shall have consented to the terms of such settlement,
which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld. If requested by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in contesting any Asserted Liability or, if appropriate and
related to the Asserted Liability in question, in making any reasonable
counterclaim against the Third Party Claimant, or any cross complaint against
any Person (other than the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates). Unless and
until the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Asserted Liability, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option and at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, to do so in such manner as it deems appropriate and the
Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any final, unappealable determination
made with respect to such Asserted Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that
unless otherwise expressly permitted hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall
not settle or compromise any Asserted Liability for which it seeks
indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

   

 (c) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to Participate Fully in (but not to control) the defense of any Asserted Liability which it has not elected to defend with its own counsel and at its own expense. As used in this Agreement, "Participate Fully" shall entitle the participating party (the "Participating Party") to participate fully in the defense of such claim with internal counsel or with outside counsel reasonably acceptable to the controlling party, and the controlling party shall permit counsel for the Participating Party to attend all significant internal meetings, all meetings with representatives of plaintiffs, hearings and the like, except that the controlling party may, in its business discretion, determine the participants for meetings with representatives of Governmental Entities with respect to governmental Actions, claims and demands under clause (g) below, in each case subject to such guidelines for participation as the controlling party shall reasonably establish. Counsel for a Participating Party also shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comment upon all memoranda of law, pleadings and briefs and other documents relating to the Third Party Claim, and the controlling party and its counsel shall give reasonable consideration to the comments of counsel for the Participating Party. If the Indemnified Party participates in the defense of a Third Party Claim for which it is not the controlling party, the expenses of the counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement of Third Party Claims for which the Indemnified Party is not the controlling party, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the cooperation requested by the Indemnifying Party. 

    (d) The parties hereto shall make mutually available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any Asserted Liability (except to the extent that such action would result in a loss of attorney-client privilege as to any material matter) and shall cooperate with each other in the defense thereof. 

  

 (e) With respect to any Asserted Liability by a Third Party Claimant constituting the Assumed Portion of any Eligible Liabilities or the portion of any Eligible Liabilities that are Excluded Liabilities and as to which Buyers Applicable Percentage is 20%, Sellers shall have the option to control the defense and settlement of any Action relating to such Eligible Liability as if, for purposes of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Section 7.5, Sellers were the Indemnifying Party rather than the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that Sellers shall select as counsel in any such defense attorneys from the firms identified on Schedule 7.5(e) or other counsel mutually acceptable to the parties and that Buyer, at its option and at its own expense, may Participate Fully in the investigation, contesting, defense and settlement of any such Eligible Liability. With respect to any Asserted Liability by a Third Party Claimant constituting the Assumed Portion of any Eligible Liabilities or the portion of any Eligible Liabilities that are Excluded Liabilities and as to which Buyers Applicable Percentage is more than 20%, Buyer shall have the option to control the defense and settlement of such Action as if, for purposes of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Section 7.5, Buyer were the Indemnifying Party rather than the Indemnified Party, provided, however, that as to any Action where Buyers Applicable Percentage is 80% or less, Buyer shall select as counsel in such defense attorneys from the firms identified in Schedule 7.5(e) or other counsel mutually acceptable to the parties and Sellers, at their option and own expense, may Participate Fully in the investigation, contesting, defense and settlement of any such Eligible Liability. 

  

 (f) If a Third Party Claimant (other than a Governmental Entity) institutes an Action, claim or demand involving both Excluded Liabilities and Assumed Liabilities (other than Assumed Portion of the Eligible Liabilities), (i) Sellers shall have the option to control the defense and settlement of such Action, claim or demand as if, for purposes of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Section 7.5, Sellers were the Indemnifying Party, if the aggregate Losses as a result of such Action, claim or demand are predominantly attributable to Excluded Liabilities and (ii) Buyer shall have the option to control the defense and settlement of such Action, claim or demand as if, for purposed of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Section 7.5, Buyer were the Indemnifying Party, if the aggregate Losses as a result of such Action, claim or demand are predominantly attributable to Assumed Liabilities; _provided_ , _however_ , that the controlling party shall select as counsel in any such defense attorneys from the firms identified on Schedule 7.5(e) or other counsel mutually acceptable to the parties and that the non-controlling party, at its own option and its own expense, may Participate Fully in the investigation, contesting, defense or settlement of any such Action, claim or demand. In the event that the Buyer and Sellers are unable to agree as to whether such aggregate Losses are predominantly attributable to Excluded Liabilities or Assumed Liabilities, 

    such dispute shall be resolved promptly by arbitration in accordance with the
procedures set forth on Schedule 7.5(f). Each party hereto shall cooperate
in good faith to facilitate prompt resolution of any dispute submitted to
arbitration pursuant to this Section 7.5(e).

  

 (g) If a Third Party Claimant which is a Governmental Entity institutes an Action involving both Excluded Liabilities and Assumed Liabilities, Buyer shall have the option to control the defense and settlement of any such Action as if, for purposes of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Section 7.5, Buyer were the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall select as counsel in any such defense attorneys from the firms identified on Schedule 7.5(e) or other counsel mutually acceptable to the parties and that Sellers, at their option and at their own expense, may Participate Fully in the investigation, contesting, defense or settlement of any such Action and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if any of Sellers are parties to such Action, CIGNA shall have the option by written notice to Buyer to jointly control such Action. In the event of joint control of any Action, each of Buyer and CIGNA shall cooperate with other in the defense and settlement of such Action, with each free to settle without the consent of the other. 

  

 (h) Sellers and their Affiliates will have reasonable access, during normal business hours and without undue disruption of Buyers and its Affiliates business, to the books and records of Buyer and its Affiliates to the extent relating to Excluded Liabilities and to the personnel of Buyer engaged in the Business. Buyer and its Affiliates will have reasonable access, during normal business hours and without undue disruption of Sellers and their Affiliates business, to the books and records of Sellers and their Affiliates to the extent relating to Assumed Liabilities and to the personnel of Sellers who have been engaged in the Business. 

     Section   |   |

7.6 _Nonduplication._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a) Any liability for indemnification under the Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 7.1(b) and Section 7.6(a), the adequacy or sufficiency of Insurance-Related Liabilities and the amount thereof are determined solely as set forth in Article II and shall not be the subject of indemnification claims for breach of a representation or warranty or as an Excluded Liability. Buyer agrees that if it challenges any amount set forth on the Closing Statement of Net Settlement which is designated as a Non-Insurance-Related Liability pursuant to Section 2.10, then to the extent Buyer is unsuccessful in such challenge Buyer may not assert a claim for a breach of representation and warranty under this Article VII as to the same matter challenged before the Third Party Accountant except to the extent Buyer obtains additional relevant information after the submission of the challenge to support such claim. 

    7.7 _Exclusivity; Investigation._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 (a) Except with respect to claims alleging fraud, the indemnities provided for in this Article VII shall be the exclusive remedies of the parties hereto and their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or any breach, nonfulfillment or default in the performance of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and the parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification or other rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the parties hereto hereby waive. 

  

 (b) Buyer has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business, operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Business, the Liabilities, the Business Financial Statements, the Statements of Net Settlement delivered pursuant to Article II and any other financial statements relating to the Business, the Liabilities, the Transferred Assets, the Acquired Companies or Sellers. In entering into this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements, Buyer and its Affiliates have relied upon its own investigation and analysis, and Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i) that, except for the specific representations and warranties of Sellers contained in Article III hereof or any Ancillary Agreement, none of Sellers or their Affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, controlling persons, agents or representatives, makes or has made any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information (including the Business Financial Statements, the Statements of Net Settlement delivered pursuant to Article II, and any other financial statements relating to the Business, the Liabilities, the Transferred Assets, the Acquired Companies or Sellers and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking information) provided (including in any management presentations, information memorandum, supplemental information or other materials or information with respect to any of the above) or otherwise made available to Buyer or any of its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, controlling persons, agents or representatives, and (ii) that, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and except for fraud, Sellers and their Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents or representatives shall not have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to Buyer or its Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents or representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or made available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to Buyer or its Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents or representatives, including in respect of the specific representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in Article III of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, except as and only to the extent expressly set forth in Article III hereof or any Ancillary Agreement with respect to such 

    representations and warranties and subject to the limitations
and restrictions contained in this Agreement.

9.8 _Specific Performance_.

  
---|---|--- 
   
   The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to any other available remedies, each other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. In the event 

    

that any action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy at law.

     Section   |   |

9.9 _Severability._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable. 

     Section   |   |

9.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 Except in the case of indemnification of Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees pursuant to Section 7.3, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto, any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

     Section   |   |

9.11 _Counterparts._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

     Section   |   |

9.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction._

  
---|---|--- 
   
  

 Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the New York State Supreme Court in the borough of Manhattan, for purposes of enforcing this Agreement. The parties shall take such actions as are within their control to cause any matter contemplated hereby to be assigned to the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court. In any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise any claims that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above court, that such action or suit is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party hereto in connection with any action, suit or other proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment. 

     9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial._

  
---|---|--- 
   
   

 Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

     Section   |   |

9.14 _Assignment; Binding Agreement._

  
---|---|--- 
   
   

 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement, nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder, may be directly or indirectly assigned, delegated, sublicensed or transferred by any party to this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any other Person (including any bankruptcy trustee) by operation of law or otherwise, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) subject to applicable regulatory approvals, Buyer may assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) to one or more of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, _provided_ that (1) no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement and (2) each wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer to which such rights or obligations have been assigned shall not further assign, sublicense or transfer (directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) such rights or obligations to any Person other than another direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, and (ii) each of Sellers may, subject to compliance with Applicable Law, freely assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) all or a portion of their rights (but not their obligations) under this Agreement. 

   
      

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the duly authorized officers of Sellers and of Buyer as of the date first above written.
