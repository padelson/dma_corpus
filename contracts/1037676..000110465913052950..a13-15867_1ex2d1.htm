 _UNIT PURCHASE AGREEMENT_

 



 

This UNIT PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of June 27,
2013, by and between Arch Coal, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "),
and Bowie Resources, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Buyer_ ").
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set
forth in _Article X_ below.

 



 

WHEREAS, Seller owns or will own as of Closing (directly or indirectly) all of
the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of the Companies, which as
of Closing will consist of: (i) a 100% membership interest (the " _Canyon Fuel
Interest_ ") in Canyon Fuel Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(" _Canyon Fuel_ "), and (ii) a 100% membership interest (the " _Newco
Interest_ " and, together with the Canyon Fuel Interest, the " _Units_ ") in a
newly formed Delaware limited liability company ("Newco") (each of the
foregoing, a " _Company_ " and collectively, the " _Companies_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Buyer desires
to acquire from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to Buyer, all of the Units
(the " _Acquisition_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors or other governing bodies, as
applicable, of Seller and Buyer have approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

 



 

Article I

 



 

 _PURCHASE AND SALE OF UNITS_

 



 

Section 1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Units_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall (or shall
cause its applicable Affiliate to) sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer,
and Buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller (or such Affiliate), all of
the Units free and clear of all Liens other than Liens created by or on behalf
of Buyer.

 



 

Section 1.02 _Payment of Initial Equity Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date,
Buyer shall pay the Initial Equity Purchase Price to Seller by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account specified by Seller to Buyer at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 



 

Section 1.03 _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher
and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 at 10:00 a.m.
New York City time, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the
third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article II_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
will not be

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied until the Closing). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 



 

Section 1.04 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer Sellers good faith estimate of (i) Cash as of the Closing
Date (the " _Cash Estimate_ "), (ii) Debt as of the Closing Date (the " _Debt
Estimate_ "), (iii) the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Working
Capital Estimate_ "), as well as a calculation of the resulting Estimated
Working Capital Overage or Estimated Working Capital Underage, (iv) the
Accounts Payable as of the Closing Date (the " _Accounts Payable Estimate_ ")
and (v) a calculation of the Initial Equity Purchase Price. The term "
_Estimated Closing Amount_ " means the sum of (i) the Cash Estimate (expressed
as a positive number), minus (ii) the Debt Estimate (expressed as a positive
number), plus (iii) the Estimated Working Capital Overage (expressed as a
positive number) or the Estimated Working Capital Underage (expressed as a
negative number), minus (iv) the Accounts Payable Estimate (expressed as a
positive number).

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared in good faith and delivered to
Seller a consolidated balance sheet which shall set forth the assets and
liabilities of the Companies as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ")
and a statement (the " _Statement_ ") of the Cash, Debt, Working Capital and
Accounts Payable derived from the Closing Date Balance Sheet (with the sum of
(i) the Cash (expressed as a positive number), minus (ii) the Debt (expressed
as a positive number), plus (iii) the Working Capital Overage (expressed as a
positive number) or the Working Capital Underage (expressed as a negative
number), minus (iv) the Accounts Payable (expressed as a positive number)
equaling the " _Closing Amount_ "), together with supporting calculations and
all other schedules and workpapers related thereto. No fact or event,
including any market or business development, occurring after the Closing
Date, and no change in GAAP (or accounting methods or practices) or Applicable
Laws after the date of this Agreement, shall be taken into consideration in
the determination of the Statement.

 



 

(c) The Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement shall become final and
binding upon the parties on the sixtieth (60th) day following delivery
thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement with the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ")
to Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of
Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence)
shall become final and binding upon Seller and Buyer on the earlier of (A) the
date Seller and Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date
any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm as
set forth below. During the thirty (30) day period following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Seller and Buyer shall
seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they

 



      
 

 



 

may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.
If at the end of the Resolution Period any matters properly included in the
Notice of Disagreement remain in dispute, Seller and Buyer may submit to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act,
such other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall
be agreed upon by the parties hereto in writing (in any such case, the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") for determination by the Accounting Firm, in accordance
with the standards set forth in this _Section 1.04_, any and all such
matters, in the form of a written brief delivered to the Accounting Firm
within thirty (30) days after the end of the Resolution Period (the "
_Submission Period_ "). If neither party makes any such submission to the
Accounting Firm during the Submission Period, the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the Statement shall become final and binding without regard to the Notice
of Disagreement. Upon such submission(s) to the Accounting Firm, the
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to, and Seller and Buyer shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to, render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days
of the receipt of such submission(s). The scope of the disputes to be resolved
by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether the Closing Amount was
calculated in accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section 1.04_
and whether there were mathematical errors in the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the Statement, and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other
determination, including whether the WC Target is correct. The Accounting
Firms decision shall be based solely on the written submission(s) and not by
independent review. The Accounting Firm shall address only those items in
dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as to
the accuracy of _Section 3.06_ or any other representation or warranty in
this Agreement or as to compliance by Seller with any of its covenants or
agreements in this Agreement (other than in this _Section 1.04_). Any
determinations by the Accounting Firm, and any work or analyses performed by
the Accounting Firm, in connection with its determination of any dispute under
this _Section 1.04_, shall not be admissible in evidence in any suit, action
or proceeding between the parties other than to the extent necessary to
enforce payment obligations under _Section 1.04(d)_. Judgment may be entered
upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction
over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The cost of
any fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 1.04_
shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail
on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations
shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination
of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the aggregate net impact on the
adjustment to the Initial Equity Purchase Price based on the merits of the
matters submitted. For the avoidance of doubt and solely as an illustration of
the methodology set forth in the preceding sentence, if (i) the Notice of
Disagreement delivered by Seller assigns values to the disputed matters such
that the Closing Amount set forth in the Statement would be increased by an
aggregate amount equal to $1,000,000, (ii) Buyer maintains that the Closing
Amount set forth in the Statement is correct and (iii) the Accounting Firms
final resolution of the disputed items in accordance with this _Section
1.04(c)_ is that the Closing Amount is increased from the

 



      
 

 



 

amount set forth in the Statement by $600,000 (i.e., sixty percent (60%) of
the amount in dispute is resolved in favor of Seller), then Seller shall be
responsible for 40% of such cost of determination and Buyer shall be
responsible for 60% of such cost of determination. Except as provided in the
two preceding sentences, the fees and disbursements of Buyers independent
accountants and Buyers legal fees incurred in connection with their review of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Statement and any Notice of Disagreement
shall be borne by Buyer, and the fees and disbursements of Sellers
independent accountants and Sellers legal fees incurred in connection with
their review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Statement and any Notice
of Disagreement shall be borne by Seller.

 



 

(d) Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the final Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Statement pursuant to _Section 1.04(c)_: (i) if
the Closing Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Amount, Buyer shall
pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an
amount equal to such excess, and (ii) if the Closing Amount is less than the
Estimated Closing Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal to such deficit. If the
Closing Amount is equal to the Estimated Closing Amount, neither Buyer nor
Seller shall be required to make any payment pursuant to this _Section 1.04_.
Any amounts due under this _Section 1.04(d)_ which are not paid when due
shall bear interest from the Closing Date until paid at the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition on the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) The term "Working Capital" means Current Assets minus Current Liabilities
as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date;
provided, that none of the following shall be included in the determination of
Working Capital: (i) any accounts receivable between or among one or more
Companies and any of their Affiliates (other than to the extent directly
related to the transfer of certain inventory pursuant to _Section 5.17_),
(ii) any trade accounts receivable that have been securitized under the AR
Securitization Facility, (iii) any account payable arising in respect of the
Shield Rebuild Agreement (regardless of the date such amount is or becomes due
and payable), (iv) the current portion of Debt, (v) Cash, (vi) any Accounts
Payable and (vii) any pushdowns or other allocations to either Company of
accrued expenses from their Affiliates that will not remain on either
Companys balance sheet immediately after Closing. The terms "Current Assets"
and "Current Liabilities" mean, respectively, the total consolidated current
assets and total consolidated current liabilities of the Companies, determined
in accordance with GAAP, other than to the extent set forth on _Exhibit D_
hereto, and (to the extent in accordance with GAAP) applied using the same
accounting methods, policies, practices, principles and procedures with
consistent classifications, judgments, estimation methodologies and line items
as were used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet. For purposes of
preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement, whether or not the
date as of which the Closing Amount is required to be calculated pursuant to
this _Section 1.04_ coincides with a fiscal quarter-end for Canyon Fuel,
Canyon Fuel shall use its normal fiscal quarter-end close procedures for the
preparation thereof, including procedures with respect to accruals and
adjustments. For purposes of calculating "Working Capital" as of the Closing
Date, inventory shall be valued using the same values ascribed to the
applicable inventory on the March 31, 2013

 



      
 

 



 

balance sheet included in the Interim Financial Statements. Attached as
_Exhibit D_ hereto is a sample illustration of the calculation of Working
Capital as of May 31, 2013.

 



 

(f) During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the
final determination of the Closing Amount in accordance with this _Section
1.04_, Buyer shall not materially alter the accounting books and records of
the Companies, or the items reflected thereon, on which the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Statement are to be based. During the period of time
from and after the Closing Date through the final determination of the Closing
Amount in accordance with this _Section 1.04_, Buyer shall afford, and shall
cause the Companies to afford, to Seller and the accountants, counsel and/or
financial advisers retained by Seller in connection with the determination of
the Closing Amount in accordance with this _Section 1.04,_ reasonable access
during normal business hours to all the properties, books, contracts,
personnel and records of the Companies relevant to the determination of the
Closing Amount in accordance with this _Section 1.04_.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the Initial Equity Purchase Price, the
components thereof and adjustments thereto shall each be determined without
duplication of any amounts contained therein.

remaining period of time in which to apply for or receive such letter and to
make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination. There has

502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code.

 



 

(f) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect (i) there are no

hereunder,

 



      
 

 



 

under the Plans or under any other agreement which, in the aggregate and with
respect to the Companies and their respective employees and other service
providers, would be reasonably likely to result in payment of any "excess

or not some other subsequent action or event would be required to cause such
payment, acceleration or provision to be triggered.

 



 

(h) No Subsidiary Plan provides for deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code.

 



 

(i) Except to the extent required pursuant to Section 4980B(f) of the Code and

of the debt financing stated therein on the terms contemplated thereby (the "
_Debt Financing_ ").

Section 4.08 _Solvency_. Upon and immediately after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer and the Companies will not (a) be
insolvent or left with unreasonably small capital, (b) have incurred debts
beyond their ability to pay such debts as they mature, or (c) have liabilities
in excess of the reasonable market value of their assets.

 



 

Section 4.09 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS _ARTICLE IV_, BUYER MAKES NO
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, AND BUYER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY

Section 5.03 _Access to Books and Records_. From the date hereof until the
Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer and its Representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to
the offices, properties, books and records of the Companies and Seller to the
extent relating to the transition of the ownership of the Companies and their
businesses to Buyer; _provided_ that such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of Seller or any of the Companies;
_provided further_ that all requests for such access shall be directed to
Seller or such other Person as Seller may designate in writing from time to
time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
not be required to disclose any information to Buyer if such disclosure would
be reasonably likely to (a) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege or (b) contravene any Applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the preceding sentence applies. Seller makes no representation or warranty as
to the accuracy of any information (if any) provided pursuant to this _Section
5.03_, and Buyer may not rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each
case other than as expressly set forth in the representations and warranties
contained in _Article III_. The information provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.03_ will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and
effecting the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.04 _Efforts_.

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each party
shall use its best efforts to cause the Closing to occur, including taking all
actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on it or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing. Each party
shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates to, take
any actions that would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in any
of the conditions set forth in _Article II_ not being satisfied. Without
limiting the foregoing or the provisions set forth in _Section 5.05_, each
party shall use its best efforts to cause the Closing to occur on or prior to
the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the actions of the
parties with respect to filings, approvals and other matters pursuant to the
HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws shall be governed by _Section 5.05,_ (ii)
the actions of the parties with respect to Consents shall be governed by
_Section 5.04(b),_ and (iii) the actions of the parties with respect to the
Financing shall be governed by _Section 5.04(c)_ through _Section 5.04(e)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use its best efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all Consents
from third parties necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Companies, Seller nor any other Subsidiary of Seller shall be
required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in
favor of) any Person from whom any such Consent may be required (other than
nominal filing or application fees). For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the foregoing
sentence shall not apply to the consents set forth on _Section 2.02(h)_ or
_Section 2.03(f)_ of the Schedules, and Buyer shall be required to obtain,
and shall be solely responsible for obtaining, the consent set forth on
_Section 2.03(f)_ of the Schedules and Seller shall be required to obtain,
and shall be solely responsible for obtaining, the Consents set forth in
_Section 2.02(h)_ of the Schedules. With the exception of the Consents set
forth on _Section 2.02(h)_ of the Schedules, Buyer acknowledges that certain
Consents and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be required from parties to the Contracts listed in the
Schedules and that such Consents and waivers have not been obtained. If any
such Consent is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment of a Canyon Fuel
Property, Mining Right or Contract would be ineffective or would adversely
affect the rights of Seller, a Company, or any other Subsidiary of Seller such
that a Company or Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights of the
Canyon Fuel Property, Mining Right or Contract, Seller and Buyer will
cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which the relevant Company
would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance
with this Agreement, including sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing
to such Company which Seller would enforce for the benefit of such Company,
with such Company assuming Sellers (or the applicable Seller Subsidiarys)
obligations, against a third party thereto. Buyer acknowledges that no
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein shall be
breached or deemed inaccurate or breached, and except with respect to Consents
listed on _Section 2.02(h)_ of the Schedules no condition shall be deemed not
satisfied, as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such Consent or waiver
or (ii) any lawsuit, action, proceeding or investigation commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such Consent or any such termination. From and after the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, exercise or exploit
their respective rights and options under each such Contract (including the
right to elect to terminate such Contract in accordance with the terms
thereof) only as reasonably directed by the Buyer.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
reasonably advisable to consummate, and obtain the proceeds of, the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including
using reasonable best efforts to, and cause its representatives to, (i)
maintain in effect the Commitment Letters; (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing consistent with the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (any such
agreements, the " _Financing Definitive Agreements_ ") and deliver to Seller a
complete, correct and executed copy thereof as promptly as practicable after
execution thereof; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the
Commitment Letters or the Financing Definitive Agreements and comply with its
obligations applicable to the Buyer and within its

 



      
 

 



 

control thereunder; (iv) obtain such third-party consents as may be reasonably
required to be obtained by Buyer in connection with the Financing; (v) upon
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, consummate the Financing on or
prior to the Closing; and (vi) promptly enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letters or Financing Definitive Agreements, as applicable, in the
event of a breach by the financing sources that impedes or delays the Closing,
including seeking specific performance by the parties thereunder. Buyer shall
not, on or prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of Seller,
(x) permit any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or
the Financing Definitive Agreements if such amendment, modification, waiver or
remedy (A) adds new (or modifies, in a manner adverse to Buyer, any existing)
conditions or contingencies to the consummation of the Financing, (B) reduces
the amount thereof below the amount required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the Base Purchase
Price and any adjustments thereto, and to pay related fees and expenses, (C)
materially adversely impacts the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Financing Definitive
Agreements or otherwise materially adversely impacts Seller, or (D) would
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (y) terminate or permit
termination of any of the Commitment Letters or the Financing Definitive
Agreements. Buyer shall promptly, upon execution thereof deliver to Seller
copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver.
In the event that all conditions to the Commitment Letter or the Financing
Definitive Agreements have been satisfied, or upon funding will be satisfied,
Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and the Equity
Investor to fund on the Closing Date the Financing (including by taking
enforcement action, including seeking specific performance, to cause such
Lenders and Equity Investor to fund such Financing) as necessary to cause the
Closing to occur by the third Business Day following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article II_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing).
Buyer shall (I) give Seller prompt oral and written notice of any breach or
default by any party to the Commitment Letters, the Financing Definitive
Agreements or any commitments pursuant to any Alternative Financing ("
_Alternative Financing Commitments_ "), any purported termination or
repudiation of the Commitment Letters, the Financing Definitive Agreements or
any Alternative Financing Commitments by any party thereto or, upon receipt
thereof notice of any material dispute or disagreement between or among the
parties to the Commitment Letters, the Financing Definitive Agreements or any
Alternative Financing Commitments and (II) otherwise keep Seller reasonably
informed of the status of Buyers efforts to arrange the Financing (or
replacement thereof). As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within three Business Days of the date Seller delivers to Buyer a written
request, Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (I) of the immediately
preceding sentence. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Buyer will (i) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable alternative debt
or equity financing, as applicable (in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with the proceeds from the Debt Financing or Equity Financing, as
applicable, to consummate the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the Base Purchase
Price and any adjustments thereto, and to pay related fees and expenses) (such
alternative debt or equity financing, " _Alternative Financing_ "), on terms
that are not less favorable to Buyer than those set forth in the Commitment
Letters and that would not have any of the effects specified in clauses (A),
(B), (C) and (D) of the second sentence of this _Section 5.04(c)_, taken as a
whole, from the same and/or other sources and enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto (which agreements with respect to the alternative debt
financing will be considered Financing Definitive Agreements), and (ii)
promptly notify Seller of such unavailability and the reason therefor.

 



 

(d) Upon the reasonable request of Buyer, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Companies) to, use its reasonable best efforts to
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing,
including, (i) reasonable assistance with preparation of all required
financial statements or other financial information relating to the Companies
to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) reasonable
participation in meetings and road shows, if any, (iii) the provision of
information relating to the Debt Financing reasonably requested by Buyer that
is reasonably necessary and customary to assist Buyer in connection with Buyer
obtaining the Debt Financing, (iv) reasonable assistance in the preparation of
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents of the Companies to the extent required by the Debt Commitment
Letter and (v) taking such action as may reasonably be requested to facilitate
the perfection of the Lenders security interest in the collateral
contemplated by the Debt Financing on the Closing Date; _provided_ that
nothing herein shall require such cooperation from Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall, promptly upon request of Seller, reimburse Seller for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with such cooperation. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Subsidiaries for and against any and all losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by Seller and its Subsidiaries) except to the extent such losses arise from
any Warranty Breach for purposes of _Section 8.01_, any breach or non-
compliance by Seller of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Any information provided to Buyer or its representatives in accordance
with this _Section 5.04_ or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement shall be
held by Buyer and its representatives in accordance with, shall be deemed to
be provided under, and shall be subject to the terms of, the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

(g) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall terminate the Equity
Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(a) of the Equity Purchase
Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



 

Section 5.05 _Regulatory Filings_.

 



 

(a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event

 



      
 

 



 

later than ten (10) Business Days following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, (i) file or cause to be filed with the FTC and the DOJ the
notification and report form, if any, required for the transactions
contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) make such other filings as are
necessary in other jurisdictions as soon as practicable in order to comply
with all Applicable Laws relating to competition and shall promptly provide
any supplemental information requested by applicable Governmental Bodies
relating thereto. Any such notification and report form and supplemental
information shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the
HSR Act and such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and Buyer shall furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission
that is necessary under the HSR Act and such other Applicable Law. Seller and
Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with,
and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the
DOJ and any other applicable Governmental Body and shall comply promptly with
any such inquiry or request and shall promptly provide any supplemental
information requested in connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant
to the HSR Act and such other Applicable Law. Any such supplemental
information shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the
HSR Act and such other Applicable Law. Further, and without limiting the
generality of the rest of this _Section 5.05_, each of the parties shall
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry and shall
promptly (i) furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other parties may request in connection with the foregoing;
(ii) inform the other of any material communication from any Governmental Body
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii)
provide counsel for the other party with copies of all filings made by such
party, and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any
Governmental Body and any other information supplied by such party and such
partys Subsidiaries to a Governmental Body or received from such a
Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (x) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Companies and (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or Applicable Law. Each
party hereto shall, subject to Applicable Laws, permit counsel for the other
parties to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other parties in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Seller agrees not to participate, or to permit their Subsidiaries
to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or
by telephone, with any Governmental Body in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with Buyer in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Body, gives Buyer the
opportunity to attend and participate.

 



 

(b) Buyer and its Affiliates shall take whatever action is reasonably
necessary to obtain any clearance under the HSR Act and such other Applicable
Law for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
prior to the Termination Date and to prevent the FTC, DOJ or other
Governmental Body, as the case may be, from filing an Antitrust Law action
with a court or Governmental Body, which if

 



      
 

 



 

the Governmental Body were to prevail, would restrain, enjoin or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In the event any action is threatened by any Governmental
Body or any Person challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of the Antitrust Laws, Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates shall take such actions, but not including any divestiture, as may
be necessary to avoid, resist or resolve such action prior to the Termination
Date. In addition, Buyer and/or its Affiliates shall take such action as may
be required by any federal or state court of the United States or any
Antitrust Law, in any action brought by a Governmental Body or any other
Person challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of the Antitrust Laws in order to avoid the entry of any preliminary
or permanent injunction or other preliminary or permanent order that would
restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and in the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer and/or its Affiliates shall take promptly any steps necessary to vacate,
modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation
prior to the Termination Date. In the event that any Governmental Body with
the authority to clear or approve the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement issues or is likely to issue an order not clearing or approving such
transactions, Buyer and its Affiliates shall take such action, as may be
reasonably necessary to avoid, resist, dissolve, reverse or resolve such
action prior to the Termination Date. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with
each other (including complying with reasonable requests for information) in
obtaining the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, obtaining
any clearance or approval under any Antitrust Law, defending any Antitrust Law
action, preventing any action that would prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or reversing, lifting or removing
any order of a Governmental Body delaying or prohibiting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall be entitled to
direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental Body. Under no
circumstances shall Buyer be required to make any divestiture in order to
obtain any clearance under the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.06 _Resignation of Managers_. Seller shall obtain the resignations,
effective contemporaneously with the Closing, of the managers, directors and,
except as set forth on _Section 5.06_ of the Schedules, the officers (as
applicable) of each of the Companies.

 



 

Section 5.07 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _FIRPTA Certificate_. Seller shall deliver to Buyer, on or prior to the
Closing Date, a certificate, duly executed and acknowledged by Seller and
signed under penalties of perjury, that satisfies the requirements set forth
in Treasury regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) and is in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller shall prepare a schedule allocating
the Initial Equity Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. Seller shall deliver
such schedule to Buyer within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date and shall
permit Buyer thirty (30) days to review and comment. Seller shall make such
revisions to the schedule as are reasonably requested by Buyer within thirty
(30) days of receiving Buyers comments, and the parties shall use reasonable
efforts to any resolve any disagreements with respect to the schedule. In the
event the parties agree to a schedule, Seller and Buyer and their respective
Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns (including for purposes of Section 1060
of the Code) consistent with such allocation and neither Seller nor Buyer (nor
any of their respective Affiliates) shall take any position (whether in
audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation
unless required to do so by Applicable Law. Buyer shall timely and properly
prepare, execute, file and deliver all such documents or other information as
Seller may reasonably request in preparing such allocation, and Seller shall
timely and properly prepare, execute, file and deliver all such documents or
other information as Buyer may reasonably request in commenting on such
allocation. Upon determination of the final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Statement pursuant to _Section 1.04_, if applicable, Seller shall promptly
prepare and deliver to Buyer a revised allocation schedule, and the parties
shall follow the procedures outlined above with respect to review, comment,
and agreement in respect of such revised allocation schedule. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that Buyer and Seller are not able to arrive at a
mutually agreeable allocation within thirty (30) days after Buyer provides
comments to Sellers schedule (or amended schedule pursuant to the previous
sentence, if applicable), each of Seller and Buyer may adopt a separate
allocation of the purchase price as such party shall determine, and each party
may use its own separate allocation in filing its own Tax Returns (including
for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code) and taking any position (whether in
audits or otherwise), except as otherwise required by a determination, as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 



 

(c) _Tax Indemnification_. Except to the extent such Taxes were included as a
Current Liability in the calculation of Working Capital for purposes of
determining the Closing Amount, Seller shall be responsible for and shall
indemnify and hold Buyer and the Companies harmless from and against (i) all
Taxes payable by or with respect to each Company and their respective
businesses, operations, and assets for periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, regardless of whether such Taxes are due on, prior to, or after
the Closing Date, (ii) any and all Taxes imposed on any member of a
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any Company (or any
predecessor of any Company) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date
by reason of Treasury regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or any analogous or
similar provision under state, local or foreign Applicable Law, (iii) all
Transfer Taxes required to be borne by Seller pursuant to _Section 5.07(e),_
and (iv) all Taxes of or imposed on Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other
than a Company) arising from the transactions described in this Agreement
(other than Transfer Taxes required to be borne by Buyer pursuant to _Section
5.07(e)_). Buyer shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold Seller
harmless from and against all Taxes payable by each Company attributable to
periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Each party
shall invoice the other party for the amount of Taxes that the other party is
responsible for pursuant to this _Section 5.07(c)_, and such amount

 



      
 

 



 

shall be paid by the other party within twenty (20) days of receipt of such
invoice, but in no case shall such payment be required to be made more than
five (5) days prior to the due date of the Tax Return to which such Taxes
relate.

 



 

(d) _Prorations_. For purposes of determining Sellers and Buyers respective
shares of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of any such Tax that is attributable to the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion beginning after the Closing Date
shall be (i) in the case of ad valorem and property Taxes, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire period, multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of
all other Taxes, determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
end of the Closing Date; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt (and
without double counting), any Taxes that were included as a Current Liability
in the calculation of Working Capital for purposes of determining the Closing
Amount shall be taken into account as amounts Seller has already paid for
determining each partys actual amount of share of Taxes that are payable with
respect to any Straddle Period; provided further that, to the extent the Taxes
that were included as a Current Liability in the calculation of Working
Capital for purposes of determining the Closing Amount exceed Sellers share
of such Taxes as determined under this _Section 5.07(d)_, Buyer shall pay
Seller any such excess pursuant to _Section 5.07(c)_. With respect to ad
valorem and property Taxes, the parties agree that Taxes that are payable in
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, and only Taxes that are payable
in such calendar year, shall be treated as Taxes that are payable with respect
to a Straddle Period for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales (including bulk sales), use, value added,
documentary, stamp, gross receipts, registration, transfer, conveyance,
excise, recording, license, stock transfer, stamp and other similar Taxes and
fees arising out of or in connection with or attributable to the transactions
effected pursuant to this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne 50%
by Seller and 50% by Buyer provided, however, that any Transfer Taxes incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by _Section 5.13_ shall be
borne exclusively by Seller. The parties shall timely file their own Tax
Returns relating to Transfer Taxes as required by Law and shall notify the
other party when such filings have been made. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
and consult with each other prior to filing such Tax Returns to ensure that
all such returns are filed in a consistent manner and shall promptly reimburse
a party who has paid more Transfer Taxes than the amount for which it is
responsible. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate, to the extent possible, in
qualifying for available exemptions or exclusions from Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(f) _Cooperation_. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation, execution and filing of Tax Returns of or
including the assets or results of operations of any Company and in connection
with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating
to any Company.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.08 _Notification of Changes_. Between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing if
such party becomes aware of (a) any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of any of such partys representations or warranties made
as of the date hereof or (b) the occurrence of any fact or condition that
would, or would be reasonably likely to, cause or constitute a breach of any
of such partys representations or warranties contained in _Article III_ and
_Article IV_, respectively, had such representation or warranty been made as
of the time of the occurrence of, or Sellers discovery of, such fact or
condition. Each party shall also promptly notify the other party of the
occurrence of any breach of any covenant of such party contained in this
Agreement or of the occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction of
the conditions in _Article II_ impossible or unlikely. Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section 5.08_, and
compliance by the parties of the provisions herewith, shall not (i) modify or
limit in any way Buyers or Sellers rights under _Article II_, _Article
III_, _Article IV_ or _Article VIII_ or any other provision hereof or (ii)
be taken in account in any respect for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.02_ or _Section 2.03_ have been
satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.09 _Intercompany Accounts_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all intercompany accounts
between Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies), on
the one hand, and the Companies, on the other hand, to be settled or otherwise
eliminated in such a manner as Seller shall determine. Intercompany accounts
between and among the Companies shall not be affected by this provision.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Effective at the Closing, Seller
shall cause all arrangements, understandings or Contracts set forth in
_Section 3.19_ of the Schedules to be terminated, except for Contracts listed
in _Section 5.10_ of the Schedules. For the avoidance of doubt, any
agreements, understandings or Contracts entered into by Seller or one of its
Affiliates with a third party, which third party is not one of the Companies
listed in _Section 3.19_ of the Schedules, shall not be terminated pursuant
to this Agreement; however, no Company shall thereafter receive any benefits
or have any liabilities under such agreements, understandings or Contracts.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Guarantees/Commitments; Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall, prior to Closing, cause itself or one or more of the
Companies to be substituted in all respects for Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Companies), and for Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Companies) to be released, effective as of the Closing, in respect of all
obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates under each guarantee,
indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, letter of comfort or other
obligation relating to the business of the Companies, including those listed
in _Section 2.03(f)_ of the Schedules (each, a " _Parent Guarantee_ ");
provided, however, that in the event that such substitution and release is not
obtained for any Parent Guarantee, following the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against, and
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for, any and all amounts paid or incurred
by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with any such Parent Guarantee that
is not substituted and released including, without limitation, any cost of
maintenance or letter of credit or other collateral paid to maintain such
Parent Guarantee.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, effective upon the Closing, the
insurance policies of Seller and its Affiliates related to the Companies shall
be terminated or modified to exclude coverage of the Companies, and, as a
result, it shall be the obligation of Buyer to obtain at its sole cost and
expense replacement insurance effective from and after the Closing, including
insurance required by any third party to be maintained by the Companies.

 



 

Section 5.12 _No Shop_.

 



 

(a) Seller will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates, either Company
or any of their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into,
either as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired corporation,
any transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business combination,

this Agreement (an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "); (ii) facilitate, solicit or
initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in
respect of an Acquisition Transaction; (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished,
to any Person, any information concerning the business, operations, properties

facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or
seek any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Seller shall and shall cause each Company and their respective
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Purchaser) conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. Seller agrees not to and to
cause each Company and their respective Representatives not to release any
third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
agreement to which the Company is a party.

Arrangements_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable

organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with a Certificate of
formation and operating agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Buyer, (ii) assign, transfer and convey to Newco the designated Canyon Fuel

_Section 5.13(iv)_ of the Schedules is also set forth on _Section 6.01(d)
(i)_ or _Section 6.01(d)(ii)_ of the Schedules, and such employee is deemed
to be deleted from _Section 6.01(d)(i)_ or _Section 6.01(d)(ii)_ of the
Schedules pursuant to _Section 6.01(d)_, such employee shall also be deemed
to be deleted from _Section 5.13(iv)_ of the Schedules).

 



 

Section 5.14 _Contact with Employees, Customers, Suppliers and Other Business
Relations_. Prior to the Closing, upon Buyers reasonable request, Seller
shall use commercially

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable efforts to afford Buyer an opportunity to engage in discussions
with the employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations of any
Company at reasonable times and subject to reasonable conditions and
compliance with Applicable Laws.

Right and the operations conducted thereat as Buyer, in its sole discretion,
shall deem necessary or prudent, and (ii) may, in its sole discretion, permit
or cause to be permitted Buyer and Buyers environmental consultant to conduct
such investigations known as "Phase II" environmental site assessments or any
other site assessment involving sampling and analysis of environmental media,

consulting firm, possessing reasonable levels of insurance, in compliance with
Applicable Laws and in a manner that minimizes the disruption of the
operations of the Companies; _provided_ that Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against, and reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates for, any and all amounts paid or incurred by Seller or its
Affiliates to the extent arising out of the activities of Buyer or its
consultants in connection with the performance of any Buyers Environmental
Assessments.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Certain Actions under the Equity Purchase Agreement_. Buyer and
certain of its Affiliates (together, the " _Buyer Parties_ ") thereof are each
a party to the Equity Purchase Agreement and a beneficiary of various
conditions precedent to the obligations thereunder of the parties to the
Equity Purchase Agreement. At the written direction of Seller, each Buyer
Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) take or cause to be taken
all action necessary to cause the waiver or satisfaction of any conditions
precedent under the Equity Purchase Agreement that are within the control of
any of the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates or which it or they may
exercise control with respect thereto and (ii) take all action reasonably
necessary to confirm to the Buyer Parties counterparties to the Equity
Purchase Agreement that such conditions precedent have been waived or
satisfied by the Buyer Parties. The Buyer Parties shall cause the prompt
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement
in connection with the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent
thereto, including, without limitation, by delivering, or causing to be
delivered, the closing deliverables required thereunder or by seeking specific
performance of the obligations of any other party thereto.

Schedules in exchange for consideration equal to the valuation of such coal or
other minerals using pricing as of March 31, 2013 as set forth in _Section

date of this Agreement, a good faith estimate of Seller of the value, as of

Article VI

 



 

 _COVENANTS OF BUYER_

 



 

Section 6.01 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all action necessary to cause
the Companies to, effective as of the Closing Date, cease to be participating
employers in any of the Plans that are not Subsidiary Plans. Buyer shall not
assume any Plan other than any Subsidiary Plan and shall have no obligations
or liabilities with respect to the Plans other than any Subsidiary Plan with
respect to liabilities and obligations thereunder with respect to any Company
Employees. Except to the extent arising from any Warranty Breach for purposes
of _Section 8.01_, on and after the Closing Date, the Companies and their
Affiliates (which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include Buyer) shall be
responsible and liable for all Employee Related Liabilities. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Employee Related Liabilities" means collectively,
any liability related to the Company Employees, to the extent such liability
relates to, results from, arises out of or was incurred in connection with
such employees employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to the
Closing, including any termination of employment on or after the Closing Date,
other than with respect to any liability relating to any Seller Plan, subject
to the provisions of _Section 6.01(e)_ hereof. For the avoidance of doubt and
without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall not assume, and Seller shall
retain and satisfy, any and all liabilities associated with Sellers defined
benefit pension plans and retiree welfare arrangements.

 



 

(b) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2014 (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall cause the Companies
to provide Company Employees with (i) annual rates of base salary or wages, as
applicable, and annual incentive compensation opportunities that are no less
favorable, as reasonably determined by Buyer, to the annual rates of base
salary or wages, as applicable and annual incentive compensation opportunities
in effect for such Company Employees as of the Closing Date and (ii) employee
benefits (other than post-retirement medical benefits) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate, as reasonably determined by Buyer, than the
employee benefits in effect for such Company Employees as of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that in no event shall severance benefits during the
Benefits Continuation Period be less favorable (A) than those provided under
the Divestiture Severance Plan  Tier I and the Divestiture Severance Plan 
Tier II, as each such severance plan is adopted by Buyer pursuant to _Section
6.01(d)_ effective as of the Closing Date, for each Company Employee covered
under such severance plans pursuant to _Section 6.01(d)_, and (B) to the
extent any Company Employee is not covered under the plans described in clause
(A), than those provided under the Severance Plan covering Arch Coal Employees
as of June 16, 2012, as amended and in effect on the date hereof. During the
Benefits Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause the Companies to honor all
Subsidiary Plans as such plans are in effect on the Closing Date and shall not
take, or cause and Person to take, any action that would adversely affect the
rights of any Company Employee thereunder, subject to Buyers right to
terminate a Subsidiary Plan. Nothing in this _Section 6.01_ is intended to
represent a guarantee of employment or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise restrict the authority of any of the Companies or to terminate the
employment of any of their employees, subject to applicable law.

 



 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plans in which any Company Employees
participate on or after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Companies to: (i)
waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees,
except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods applied under the similar plan in effect immediately prior to the
Closing (ii) provide each such employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid (to the same extent such credit was given for the year under
the similar plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements; and (iii) recognize all
continuous service of the Company Employees with the Companies, Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller (including continuous service with an entity that was
previously acquired by the Companies), as applicable, for all purposes
(including for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit and
entitlement to benefits, including under any paid time off and severance plans
or policies, but excluding benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension
plan) under any employee benefit plan in which such employees may be eligible
to participate after the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. This
_Section 6.01_ shall survive the Closing, is intended to benefit the
Companies, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the
Companies.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Companies to, adopt, effective as of the
date of the Closing, (i) the Divestiture Severance Plan  Tier I, in the form
attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto, covering the Company Employees identified on
_Section 6.01(d)(i)_ of the Schedules and (ii) the Divestiture Severance Plan
 Tier II, in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto, covering the Company
Employees identified on _Section 6.01(d)(ii)_ of the Schedules; provided,
however, that Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge that Seller shall have the
right to extend, or cause one or more of its Affiliates to extend, offers of
employment (A) on terms no more favorable to such Company Employee than those
existing on the date of this Agreement to any or all of the Company Employees
listed on _Section 6.01(d)(i)_ and _Section 6.01(d)(ii)_ of the Schedules
prior to Closing in response to unsolicited inquiries from such Company
Employee or (B) as a result of an unsolicited inquiry from or application by a
Company Employee in response to an open position posted by the Seller on the
Sellers intranet; and provided further, that in the event that any of the
Company Employees listed on _Section 6.01(d)(i)_ or _Section 6.01(d)(ii)_ of
the Schedules elect to accept such offer, such employees shall be deemed to be
deleted from _Section 6.01(d)(i)_ or _Section 6.01(d)(ii)_ of the Schedules
(as applicable) for the purposes of this _Section 6.01(d)_.

 



 

(e) Except to the extent arising from any Warranty Breach for purposes of
_Section 8.01_, after the Closing Date, the Companies shall pay, or Buyer
shall pay or shall cause one or more of Buyers Affiliates to pay, all
liabilities of either Company, Seller or any Affiliate of Seller with respect
to any current or former employees of either Company (including retired
employees who retired from one of the Companies or a predecessor thereto)
under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended, and other

 



      
 

 



 

Applicable Law for any Claims for disability or death due to "black lung" or
pneumoconiosis or any similar or related conditions, whenever created.

 



 

(f) This _Section 6.01_ shall survive the Closing, is intended to benefit the
Companies, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the
Companies. Nothing in this _Section 6.01_ shall (i) create any third party
beneficiary right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement,
including any current or former employee of the Companies, any participant in
any Plan or any dependent or beneficiary thereof or (ii) constitute an
amendment to any Plan or any other plan or arrangement covering employees of
the Companies.

 



 

Section 6.02 _Name Change_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) eliminate (or cause to
be eliminated) the use of the names "Arch Coal" and "ACI" and variants thereof
from the properties, assets, and businesses of the Companies and (ii) make (or
cause to be made) all filings (including assumed name filings) required to
reflect any change of name of each Company in all applicable records of
Government Bodies. Except with respect to such grace period for eliminating
existing usage, Buyer shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks, trade
names or other similar rights owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates other
than the Companies. Buyer shall provide copies of such filings to Seller and
be solely responsible for any direct or indirect costs or expenses resulting
from the change in use of name, and any resulting notification or approval
requirements.

Section 7.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be validly terminated only as
follows:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller at any time prior to the
Closing;

 



 

(b) by either Seller or Buyer, by written notice to the other party, if the

and twenty (120) days after the date hereof (the " _Initial Termination Date_
"); _provided_ that if prior to the Initial Termination Date, any of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 2.01_ have not been satisfied
(or waived) but all other conditions to the Closing (other than those
conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have
been satisfied (or waived) or are capable of being satisfied by the Initial
Termination Date, the Initial Termination Date may be extended by either
Seller or Buyer for up to three (3) months from the Initial Termination Date
(the Initial Termination Date, as it may be extended pursuant to this _Section
7.01(b)_, is referred to herein as the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of any
covenant or agreement under this Agreement shall have been a material cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such
date;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) by either Seller or Buyer, if any Prohibitive Order permanently
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.01(c)_ shall
not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under
this Agreement shall have been a material cause of, or resulted in, the
occurrence of such Prohibitive Order;

 



 

(d) by Buyer, by written notice to Seller, if Seller has breached or failed to
perform any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement
or if any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement
shall be or shall have become inaccurate, in either case (i) such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ or _Section 2.02_ would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or failure or as of the time such
representation or warranty was or shall have become inaccurate, and (ii) such
breach or failure to perform or inaccuracy cannot be cured by Seller or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days
after receipt by Seller of notice in writing from Buyer, specifying the nature
of such breach and requesting that it be cured, or Buyer shall not have
received adequate assurance of a cure of such breach within such thirty (30)
day period; _provided_ that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.01(d)_ if it is then in breach of any
of its covenants set forth in this Agreement that would result in the closing
conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ or _Section 2.03_ (other than those
conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing) not
being satisfied;

 



 

(e) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, if Buyer has breached or failed to
perform any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement
or if any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement
shall be or shall have become inaccurate, in either case (i) such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ or _Section 2.03_ cannot be satisfied
and (ii) such breach or failure to perform or inaccuracy cannot be cured by

closing conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ or _Section 2.02_ (other than
those conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing)
not being satisfied; or

 



 

(f) by Seller, if all of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ and
_Section 2.02_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing) and Buyer fails to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.03_, and Seller stood
ready and willing to consummate such transactions on that date; _provided_
that if Seller elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.01(f)_ rather than exercise, or continue to exercise, its remedies pursuant
to _Section 11.15(b)_, then, within five (5) Business Days upon notification
of such election, Buyer shall pay to Seller, in immediately available funds,
an amount equal to $20,000,000 plus all of the

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all reasonable fees,
expenses and disbursements of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to Seller and its Affiliates and representatives)
incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries on or prior to the termination
of this Agreement in connection with the consideration of, and planning for,
the negotiation of and all the efforts to implement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, any reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ "). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that payment of such amount
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller against the Buyer or any of
its Representatives, Affiliates or any Debt Financing Sources for any loss
suffered by Seller hereunder in the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.01(f)_, and upon payment of such amount, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby (except that Buyer
shall remain obligated for, and Seller may be entitled to remedies with
respect to, the Confidentiality Agreements, any expense reimbursement and
indemnity obligations of Buyer contained in _Section 5.04(e)_ and _Section
5.15_ and any interest and expenses pursuant to the following sentence of this
_Section 7.01(f)_). In the event that Buyer fails to timely pay any amount
due pursuant to this _Section 7.01(f)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Seller commences a suit that results in a judgment against Buyer for the
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay Seller its costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such suit along with the Reverse
Termination Fee, together with interest on such aggregate amount due Seller
pursuant to this _Section 7.01(f)_ at the annual rate of five percent (5%)
plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have no obligation to
pay such amount, in the circumstances where such amount is owed pursuant to
this _Section 7.01(f)_, in the event Seller seeks specific performance unless
and until such request for specific performance is rejected or withdrawn.

 



 

Section 7.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01_, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no further force
and effect, and no party (nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates) shall
have any liability to any other Person; _provided_ that (i) the obligations of
the parties hereto contained in _Section 5.01_, _Section 7.01_, this
_Section 7.02_ and _Article XI_, the expense reimbursement and indemnity
obligations of Buyer contained in _Section 5.04(e)_ and _Section 5.15_ and
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability or damages
to the extent that failure to satisfy the conditions of _Article II_ results
from a willful breach of any covenant or agreement made by such party.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.01_, Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event later than
three (3) Business Days following such termination, return to Seller or
destroy, and will cause its Representatives

 



      
 

 



 

to return to the Companies or destroy, all of the documents and other
materials received from the Companies, Seller or its respective Affiliates
and/or Representatives relating to any of them or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether so obtained before or after execution
of this Agreement, and Buyer (or, if Buyer is not signatory thereto, its
Affiliate signatory thereto) shall comply with all of its obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Article VIII

 



 

 _INDEMNITY_

 



 

Section 8.01 _Seller s Agreement to Indemnify_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this _Article VIII_, Seller shall, from and after the
Closing, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, which
after the Closing shall include the Companies, (and their respective directors
and officers) (the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Claims, liabilities, losses, damages, payments, deficiencies, awards,
settlements, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating and defending any
Claims and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, consultants and
other professionals (collectively, " _Damages_ "), which any of them shall
incur, sustain or suffer and which relate to or arise, directly or indirectly,
out of or in connection with (i) any breach or inaccuracy by Seller of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement (each such breach and inaccuracy,
a " _Warranty Breach_ ") or (ii) any breach or non-compliance by Seller of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement (items (i) and (ii) collectively, "
_Buyer Claims_ "); it being agreed for purposes of this _Section 8.01_ that
any Warranty Breach or breach or non-compliance by Seller of any covenant or
agreement and the amount of any Damages arising therefrom shall be determined
without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality (including the
word "material" or "Material Adverse Effect") except with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in the last sentence of _Section
3.05(b)_ and _Section 3.15_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Damages relating to
any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent (i) the
Buyer Indemnitees have already recovered the same Damages with respect to such
matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement or (ii) such Damages
were taken into account in determining the Closing Amount (and had the effect
of reducing the Initial Equity Purchase Price).

 



 

Section 8.02 _Seller s Limitation of Liability_. Seller shall not be liable

indirectly, out of or in connection with (i) a breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) non-
fulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Buyer or (iii) the ownership or
operation of the Companies on and after the Closing Date (with the exception
in the case of clause (iii), for any claims with respect to which Seller is

shall give prompt written notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any Claim, or the
commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity
may be sought and will provide such Indemnifying Party such information with
respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided,
that the failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided for hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

Section 8.06 _Conditions of Indemnification With Respect to Third-Party
Claims_. The obligations and liabilities of Seller and Buyer with respect to
Buyer Claims and Seller Claims, respectively, which arise or result from
Claims for Damages made by third parties (" _Third-Party Claims_ ") shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:

 



 

(a) The Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of
any such Third-Party Claim, setting forth therein in reasonable detail the
basis for such Third-Party Claim (and will provide such Indemnifying Party
such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request), and the Indemnifying Party shall, if the Indemnifying
Party has confirmed in writing that it has the obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim, have the right to
undertake the defense thereof by counsel chosen by it and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, that failure to provide such
prompt notice

 



       
 

 



 

shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure;
and provided, further, that the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party in defending such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party undertakes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after notice of any
such Third-Party Claim (and in any event within thirty (30) days after such
notice), fails to defend the Indemnified Party against which such Third-Party
Claim has been asserted (or after assuming such defense, fails to diligently
prosecute, or withdraws from, such defense), the Indemnified Party shall (upon
further notice to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the
defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim for the account
and risk of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party will reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in defending such Third-Party Claim; and

 



 

(c) Any provision in this _Article VIII_ to the contrary notwithstanding, (A)
if there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may materially
and adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money
damages or other money payments, the Indemnified Party shall have the absolute
right, to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim; provided,
however, that if such Third-Party Claim is settled without the Indemnifying
Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have waived all rights
hereunder against the Indemnifying Party for Damages arising out of such
Third-Party Claim; (B) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
or consent to the entry of any judgment which (i) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party a release from all liability in respect to such Third-Party
Claim, (ii) includes the award of monetary damages that will not be paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party or (iii) subjects the Indemnified Party to any
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy; and (C) except as provided in
clause (A) of this _Section 8.06(c)_ the Indemnified Party shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment.

 



 

Section 8.07 _Limitation on Damages_.

 



 

(a) Any indemnification payable pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be net
of any amounts recoverable (after deducting related costs and expenses) by the
Indemnified Party:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) for the Damages for which such indemnification payment is made, under any
warranty or indemnity from any third party; and

 



 

(ii) under applicable insurance policies.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnified Party determines not to pursue any such recovery under
_Section 8.07(a)_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party (in its name or in the name of
the Indemnified Party) shall be entitled to pursue such recovery directly and
the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in its pursuit of such recovery (including the assignment
by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party of any rights to proceed
against the applicable third party), provided that (x) such recovery shall not
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the business of the Indemnified
Party and (y) the Indemnifying Party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the Indemnified Party from and against, and shall pay or reimburse the
Indemnified Party for, any Damages which it may incur or to which it may be
subjected, resulting from or arising out of or otherwise based upon the
Indemnifying Partys efforts to pursue any such recovery.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this _Article VIII_ for
any (1) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) there is
included in the Financial Statements an identifiable liability or reserve
(including liabilities or reserves that are not individual line items, but are
identifiable components of a line item) relating to such matter (it being
understood that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the excess of the
Damages over such identifiable liability or reserve) or (B) the Indemnified
Party had otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant to the closing
payment adjustment mechanism contemplated by _Section 1.04_ (it being
understood that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the excess of
the Damages over such Initial Equity Purchase Price adjustment compensation
under _Article I_), or (2) special, punitive, indirect or consequential
Damages or Damages arising from or relating to lost profits or diminution in
value (except to the extent that any such Damages are a natural, probable and
reasonably foreseeable result of the applicable breach or are component of any
Third-Party Claim).

 



 

(d) If the Indemnified Party shall have received the payment required by this
Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of Damages and shall
subsequently receive amounts recoverable under clauses (i) or (ii) of _Section
8.07(a)_, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying
Party a sum equal to the amount of such amounts actually received under
clauses (i) or (ii) of _Section 8.07(a)._

 



 

Section 8.08 _Sole Remedy_. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer waives any rights and Claims Buyer and its Affiliates may
have against Seller and its Affiliates, whether in law or in equity, relating
to the Companies or any of their assets, business or operations, the Units or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and Seller waives any such rights and
Claims Seller and its Affiliates may have against Buyer and its Affiliates and
the Company (following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby). The rights and Claims waived hereby include Claims for contribution
or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental
Laws, Claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or

 



      
 

 



 

warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other Claims for breach of duty.
Except with respect to matters governed by _Section 5.07_, after the Closing,
this _Article VIII_ will provide the exclusive monetary remedy for any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement or other
Claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that nothing herein shall
prohibit any party hereto from exercising its rights to seek equitable relief
with respect to a breach of covenant or agreement under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event shall
any of the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.08_, or _Section 8.02_
or _Section 8.04_ limit a claim for fraud.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Tax Treatment_. The amount of any payments made pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ shall be treated by Buyer and Seller and their respective
Affiliates as adjustments to the Base Purchase Price for all Tax purposes,
except to the extent that a contrary treatment is required by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Damages upon and
after becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any costs of such mitigation that would not
otherwise be incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business shall also constitute
Damages.

Section 11.15 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise by
a party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
such remedy.

 



 

(b) The parties understand and agree that the covenants and undertakings on
each of their parts herein contained are uniquely related to the desire of the
parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate the transaction
contemplated herein, that the transaction contemplated herein represent a
unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of Seller and Buyer and
their respective Affiliates and further agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its terms and further agree that, although monetary damages
may be available for the breach of such covenants and undertakings, monetary
damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, each party hereto
agrees, on behalf of themselves and their respective Subsidiaries, that, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by Seller, on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations
set forth in this Agreement, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under
this Agreement and this right shall include the right of Seller to cause Buyer
to fully enforce (A) the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and Financing
Definitive Agreements against the Lenders to

 



      
 

 



 

the fullest extent permissible pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and
Financing Definitive Agreements and (B) the terms of the Equity Purchase
Agreement against the Equity Investor to the fullest extent permissible
pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, as applicable, and to thereafter
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. In the event that any action should be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each
party hereto hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
law. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
(x) Seller has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
acknowledge and agree that Seller shall not be entitled to enforce
specifically the obligations of Buyer to consummate the Acquisition unless (i)
all of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ and _Section 2.02_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied other than at the Closing) and (ii) the full proceeds to be provided
to Buyer by the Financing shall be available to Buyer to complete the
Acquisition.
