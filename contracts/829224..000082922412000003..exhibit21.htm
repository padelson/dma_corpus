 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of November 14, 2012 (this "Agreement"),
by and among Starbucks Corporation, a Washington corporation ("Parent"), Taj
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Sub"), and Teavana Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub deems it in the
best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger (the
"Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would survive
and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors
have approved this Agreement, declared its advisability and recommended that
this Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company or Sub, as the
case may be;

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as
a condition to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement,
Parent, the Company and each of Andrew Mack and Nancy Mack (the "Founders")
have entered into a noncompetition agreement, pursuant to which the Founders
will agree, among other things, to certain non-interference, non-solicitation,
non-competition and no hire restrictions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

The Merger

SECTION 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be not later than the second business day after satisfaction or
(to the extent



permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at Closing) (except, if such
conditions are satisfied or waived on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, on December 31, 2012, the Closing shall occur on December 31, 2012), at
the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New
York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company; provided, however, that if all the conditions set
forth in Article VI shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted
by Law) waived on such second business day (or on December 31, 2012, as
applicable), then the Closing shall take place on the first business day on
which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

SECTION 1.03. Effective Time of the Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date, the parties shall properly file a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such subsequent date and time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger.
The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Effective Time".

SECTION 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. (a) The certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended by virtue of the Merger at the Effective Time to read in
the form of Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) The bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the same form as the
bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and, as so
amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

SECTION 1.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



SECTION 1.07. Officers. The officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

Conversion of Securities

SECTION 2.01. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.00003 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock"), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

(a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of
Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (ii) except as
provided in Section 2.02, the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive $15.50 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration");
provided, however, that the shares of Company Common Stock that are Specified
Stockholder Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration less the Per Share Escrow Amount plus any Escrow Proceeds (such
sum, the "Escrow Consideration"). At the Effective Time such shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry
form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares
(a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Cash Consideration or the Escrow Consideration, as
applicable (the "Merger Consideration") in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such withholding
to be pursuant to the terms of Section 2.03(f) and any applicable tax Law.



SECTION 2.02. Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or
evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent
of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of any such demands and any other related instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL that are received by the Company, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 2.03. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, cash in immediately available funds (such cash in
immediately available funds, the "Exchange Fund") in amounts necessary for the
payment of the Merger Consideration (excluding the Escrow Amount) pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that all
such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent and that any and all
interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent. In the
event that the Exchange Fund is at any time insufficient to satisfy all of the
payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement,
Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent as promptly as practicable any
additional amounts necessary to satisfy such obligations.



(b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (but no later than two business days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
include an accompanying substitute IRS Form W‑9 or the applicable IRS Form
W‑8, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of such Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such
other provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an
"agent's message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash equal to the Merger Consideration (excluding, in the case of the
Specified Stockholders, the Escrow Proceeds) that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and each Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate (it being understood that, in the
case of the shares of Company Common Stock that are Specified Stockholder
Shares, the payment of the Cash Consideration less the Per Share Escrow Amount
upon the surrender of a Certificate in respect of such shares in accordance
with the terms of this Article II, and the deposit of the Escrow Amount in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed to have been in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares formerly represented by
such Certificate, but that the Specified Stockholders shall continue to have
the right to receive the Escrow Proceeds in accordance with, and subject to,
the terms of the Escrow Agreement). At the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close



of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any
other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

(d) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger
Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any
Certificate which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
any Merger Consideration payable in accordance with this Article II in respect
thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the
Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
Certificate.

(f) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Stock Options such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock or Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

(g) Termination of Fund. At any time following the six-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with

ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties

SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth in (x) the letter delivered by the Company to Parent not later than 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Letter")
(with specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such disclosure relates; provided that disclosure of
information in any section of the Company Letter shall be deemed to qualify or
apply to other Sections in this Article III to the extent it is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to
such other Sections) or (y) the Filed SEC Documents filed on or after January
29, 2012, other than any disclosure contained or referenced therein under the
captions "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" and any other
disclosure contained or referenced therein of information, factors or risks
that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature (it being agreed
that any matter disclosed in such Filed SEC Documents shall be deemed to
qualify this Article III only to the extent that it is readily apparent from
such disclosure the Section or Sections of this Agreement to which such
disclosure is relevant), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub
as follows:

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization (except, in the case of good standing, for entities organized
under the Laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept), (ii)
has all requisite corporate, company, partnership or other organizational
power and authority to carry on its business as currently conducted and (iii)
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction (except, in the case of good standing, any jurisdiction that does
not recognize such concept) in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than where the



failure to be so organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good
standing (except, in the case of clause (i) above, with respect to the
Company), individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation of the
Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Certificate"),
and the bylaws of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Bylaws"), and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to the date of this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes,
the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders, the Board
of Directors and each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries held since February 1, 2009. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of all resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company, and each committee thereof, in respect of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Subsidiaries. Section 3.01(b) of the Company Letter sets forth a list of
each Subsidiary of the Company and its place and form of organization. All the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, each such Subsidiary are owned by the Company, by one or more wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company or by the Company and one or more wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
charges, options, security interests or other encumbrances of any kind or
nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), except for transfer restrictions
imposed by applicable securities Laws, and are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except for the capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not
own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, any person.

(c) Capital Structure. (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Preferred Stock"). At the close of business on November 11, 2012, (A)
38,777,893 shares of Company Common Stock (excluding treasury shares) were
issued and outstanding, (B) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by the
Company as treasury shares and (C) 1,644,466 shares of Company Common Stock
were reserved and available for issuance in the aggregate pursuant to the 2011
Stock Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan") and the 2004 Management Incentive Plan
(the "2004 Plan", and together with the 2011 Plan, the "Company Stock Plans"),
of which 1,439,246 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to outstanding
options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock from the Company (such
options, together with any other stock options



granted after November 11, 2012, in each case whether granted pursuant to the
Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the "Stock Options"). As of the date of this
Agreement none of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
are subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions or a right of repurchase by
the Company. All outstanding Stock Options have been granted under the Company
Stock Plans. Other than the Company Stock Plans, there is no plan, Contract or
arrangement providing for the grant of Stock Options. No shares of Company
Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. No shares of Company Common Stock
are owned by any Subsidiary of the Company. Section 3.01(c)(i) of the Company
Letter sets forth a list, as of the close of business on November 11, 2012, of
all outstanding Stock Options, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to each such Stock Option, the grant date, exercise price per share,
vesting schedule and expiration date of each such Stock Option, the name of
the holder thereof, an indication of whether or not each such holder is a
current director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not such Stock Option (or any portion thereof) is intended to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code and the
name of the Company Stock Plan pursuant to which each such Stock Option was
granted. As of the date of this Agreement, other than the outstanding Stock
Options, there are no outstanding rights of any person to receive Company
Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, on a deferred basis
or otherwise.

(ii) Except for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Stock Options
set forth in Section 3.01(c)(i), as of the close of business on November 11,
2012, no shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
the Company, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable
for, or options, warrants, shares of deferred stock, restricted stock awards,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance units, phantom
stock awards or other rights to acquire any such capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company, or other rights that are linked to
the value of Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part
thereof, were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. From the close of
business on November 11, 2012 to the date of this Agreement, (A) there have
been no issuances by the Company of shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company, other than issuances of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options outstanding as
of November 11, 2012, and only if and to the extent required by their
respective terms as in effect on such date and (B) there have been no
issuances by the Company of securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, or options, warrants, shares of deferred stock, restricted
stock awards, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance
units, phantom stock awards, other rights to acquire shares of capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company, or other rights that
are linked to the value of Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or
any part thereof.



(iii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all
shares that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans will be, when
issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. Except as
set forth in this Section 3.01(c), there are no (A) bonds, debentures, notes
or other indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (B)
securities or other instruments or rights (including stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock awards or other similar rights) issued by, or other
obligations of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, that are
linked to, or the value of which is in any way based upon or derived from, the
value of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the value of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any dividends or other distributions
declared or paid on any shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or which have or which
by their terms may have at any time (whether actual or contingent) the right
to vote (or which are convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries may vote (the items referred to in clauses (A) and (B)
collectively, "Equity Equivalents"). Except as set forth in this Section
3.01(c), there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights or
Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, obligating
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable
or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
security, option, warrant, call, right or Contract. With respect to the Stock
Options, (1) each Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, (2) each grant of a Stock
Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such
Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the "Grant Date") by all
necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Board of
Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized committee
thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of
votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing such grant (if
any) was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto, (3) each such
grant was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws and regulatory rules or
requirements, including the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and any other
exchange on which Company securities are traded, (4) the per share exercise
price of each Stock Option was not less than the fair market value (within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code, in the case of each Stock Option intended
to qualify as an "incentive stock option" and within the



meaning of Section 409A of the Code, in the case of each other Stock Option)
of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date and (5) each
such grant was properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the financial
statements (including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the
Company's SEC Documents in accordance with the Exchange Act and all other
applicable Laws. Except pursuant to the forfeiture conditions of the Stock
Options outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and except pursuant to
the cashless exercise or tax withholding provisions of such Stock Options as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual
or other obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (I)
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(II) vote or dispose of any shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is
not a party to any voting agreement with respect to any shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement there are no irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements with
respect to any shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has not knowingly
granted, and there is no and has been no Company policy or practice to grant,
Stock Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of Stock Options
with, the release or other public announcement of material information
regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their financial results or
prospects.

(iv) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any (A) indebtedness for borrowed money, (B) indebtedness
evidenced by any bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture or other debt
instrument or debt security, (C) amounts owing as deferred purchase price for
the purchase of any property, (D) capital lease obligations or (E) guarantees
with respect to any indebtedness or obligation of a type described in clauses
(A) through (D) above of any other person (collectively, "indebtedness").

(v) All Stock Options may, by their terms, be treated in accordance with
Section 5.04(a). No holder of any Stock Option is entitled to any treatment of
such Stock Option other than as provided with respect to such Stock Option in
Section 5.04(a), and after the Closing no holder of a Stock Option (or former
holder of a Stock Option) or any current or former participant in the Company
Stock Plans or any other Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement shall have the
right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or any other
equity interest therein (including phantom stock or stock appreciation
rights). All outstanding Stock Options are evidenced by individual written
stock option agreements (the "Stock Option Agreements") substantially
identical to the form made available to Parent and its counsel.



(vi) The persons set forth on Section 5.01 of the Company Letter are the
record holders of each share of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
such persons and collectively are the record holders of over 70% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Nancy Mack is not the record
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock.

(d) Authority; Noncontravention. The Company has the requisite corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the provisions of this Agreement, subject, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, to obtaining the Stockholder Approval. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Noncompetition Agreement by the Company, the
consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance by the Company with the

Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms. The Board of Directors of

stockholders in the Merger is fair to such stockholders and (iv) recommending
that the Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement, which resolutions,
except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 4.02, have not been
rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance by the Company with the
provisions of this Agreement do not and will not conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss of a benefit under,
or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or give rise to any
increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements under
(including any



right of a holder of a security of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

assets are subject or bound or otherwise under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has rights or benefits or (C) subject to the governmental filings
and other matters referred to in the following sentence, any (1) Federal,
state or local, domestic, foreign, multinational or supranational statute,

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancelations, accelerations,
losses, Liens, rights or entitlements that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect or (y)
impair in any material respect the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization
of, registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Federal, state
or local, domestic or foreign, government or any court, administrative agency
or commission or other governmental, quasi‑governmental or regulatory

under this Agreement.

(e) SEC Documents. (i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, all
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents with the SEC

Documents"), in each case at or prior to the time required. No Subsidiary of
the Company is required to file or furnish any report, schedule, form,
statement or other document with, or make any other filing with, or furnish
any other material to, the SEC. As of their respective dates, each of the SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act") and the Exchange
Act, in each case, applicable to such SEC Document, and none of the SEC
Documents at the time it was filed or furnished contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has made
available to Parent copies of all comment letters received by the Company from
the SEC since January 29, 2012 and relating to the SEC Documents, together
with all written responses of the Company thereto. As of the date of this

letters received by the Company from the SEC. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the SEC Documents is the

the related notes) of the Company included in the SEC Documents complied, at
the time the respective statements were filed, as to form in all material
respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time in
the United States of America ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form 10‑Q of the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of

not material to the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B) liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business after the date



of the latest balance sheet included in the Baseline Financials that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries have no
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that are required to be disclosed under GAAP in a
financial statement or footnote thereto.

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated

Company was subject thereto) arranged any outstanding, "extension of credit"
to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose or intended
or known result or effect of such joint venture, partnership or Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' published financial statements or other SEC Documents.

the date of



this Agreement, collectively, "Benefit Agreements"), (vii) any grant or

any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no Judgment

The Contracts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the type referred
to in clauses (A) through (Q) of this subsection (i) (whether in effect on the
date of this Agreement or entered into following the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing Date), together with the Franchise Agreements, are
collectively referred to in this Agreement as "Specified Contracts". The
Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of each of
the Specified Contracts, including all amendments thereto. Each Specified
Contract is in full force and effect (except for those Contracts that have
expired in accordance with their terms) and is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, of each other party thereto, enforceable against the
Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, against the other party or parties thereto, in each case, in
accordance with its terms. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,
(x) each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) in breach or default under any Specified Contract and
has not waived or failed to enforce any rights or benefits thereunder (other
than in the ordinary course of business), (y) no other party to any of the
Specified Contracts is (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) in
breach or default thereunder and (z) there has occurred no event that (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) would give to others any right of
termination, material amendment or cancellation of any Specified Contract.

(i) Permits; Compliance with Laws. The Company and its Subsidiaries have in
effect all certificates, permits, licenses, franchises, approvals,
concessions, qualifications, registrations, certifications and similar
authorizations from any Governmental Entity (collectively, "Permits") that are
necessary for them to own, lease or operate their properties and assets and to
carry on their businesses in all material respects as currently conducted.
Section 3.01(i) of the Company Letter sets forth, as of the date of this
Agreement, a list of all Permits that are material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, other than ordinary course Permits generally required for the
operation of a retail store of any type. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and since February 1, 2009 has been, in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws (for the avoidance of doubt, when
used in this Agreement "applicable Laws" shall include Franchise Laws and
Relationship Laws) and Judgments, and no condition or state of facts exists
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a material violation of, or
a material liability or default under, any applicable Law or Judgment. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and



compliance with the terms hereof would not reasonably be expected to, cause
the revocation or cancellation of any material Permit. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written communication during the past
three years from any person that alleges that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance in all material respects with, or is subject
to material liability under, any Permit, Law or Judgment or relating to the
revocation or modification of any material Permit. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice that any investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity is pending with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the assets or operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or that any such investigation or review is
contemplated.

(j) Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans; Employment Agreements; Labor
Relations. (i) Except as disclosed in the Filed SEC Documents or as required
under applicable Law, since January 29, 2012, none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has adopted, entered into, established, terminated, amended
or modified or agreed to adopt, enter into, establish, terminate, amend or
modify (or announced an intention to adopt, enter into, establish, terminate,
amend or modify) any collective bargaining agreement or any employment, bonus,
pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, equity
or equity-based compensation, performance, retirement, thrift, savings,
cafeteria, paid time off, material perquisite or fringe benefit, vacation,
unemployment, severance, change in control, termination, retention,
disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other welfare benefit
or other similar plan, program, policy, arrangement or understanding (whether
oral or written, formal or informal, funded or unfunded and whether or not
legally binding or subject to the Laws of the United States) sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or required to be sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other person or
entity that, together with the Company, is treated as a single employer under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or with respect to which the
Company is otherwise jointly or severally liable under applicable Law (each, a
"Commonly Controlled Entity"), in each case, providing compensation or
benefits to any Company Personnel, including the Company Stock Plans, but not
including the Benefit Agreements (all such plans, programs, policies,
arrangements and understandings, collectively, "Benefit Plans"), or has made
any material change in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate
funding obligations with respect to any Pension Plan, or any change in the
manner in which contributions to any Pension Plan are made or the basis on
which such contributions are determined.

(ii) There are no collective bargaining or other labor union agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound. Since February 1, 2009 neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has encountered any labor union organizing activity, or had any



actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no labor union organizing activity,
strike, work stoppage, slowdown or lockout is threatened. None of the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is represented by any
labor union, works council or similar organization with respect to his or her
employment by the Company or such Subsidiary. The Company and its Subsidiaries
do not have any obligation (including to inform or consult with any such
employees or their representatives in respect of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) with respect to any such
organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and since February
1, 2009 has been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Laws and Judgments relating to labor relations, employment and employment
practices, occupational safety and health standards, terms and conditions of
employment, payment of wages, classification of employees, immigration, visa,
work status, human rights, pay equity and workers' compensation, and is not,
and since February 1, 2009 has not, engaged in any unfair labor practice.
There is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, in each case before the National Labor Relations Board or any
comparable Governmental Entity. No question concerning representation has been
raised or is, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened respecting the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No grievance or
arbitration proceeding arising out of a collective bargaining agreement is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(k) Environmental Matters. (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is,
and has been, in compliance in all material respects with all Environmental
Laws, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
communication alleging that the Company or such Subsidiary is in violation of,
or may have liability under, any Environmental Law; (ii) each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries possesses and is in compliance in all material respects
with all Permits required under Environmental Laws ("Environmental Permits")
for the conduct of its operations, and all such Environmental Permits are
valid and in good standing; (iii) there are no material Environmental Claims
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) there has been no Release of or exposure to any
Hazardous Material that would reasonably be expected to form the basis of any
material Environmental Claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
against any person whose liabilities for such Environmental Claims the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has, or may have, retained or assumed, either
contractually or by operation of Law; (v) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has retained or assumed, either contractually or by operation of
Law, any liabilities or obligations that would reasonably be expected to form
the basis of any material



Environmental Claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (vi)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries stores, generates or disposes
of Hazardous Materials (other than cleaning supplies used and stored in the
ordinary course of store operations) at, on, under, about or from property

no past or present events, conditions, circumstances, activities, practices,
incidents, actions or plans that would reasonably be expected to form the
basis of a material Environmental Claim against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

For all purposes of this Agreement, (A) "Environmental Claims" means any and
all administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, Judgments, demands,
directives, claims, Liens, investigations, proceedings or written or oral
notices of noncompliance or violation by or from any person alleging liability
of any kind or nature (including liability or responsibility for the costs of
enforcement proceedings, investigations, cleanup, governmental response,
removal or remediation, natural resource damages, property damages, personal
injuries, medical monitoring, penalties, contribution, indemnification and
injunctive relief) arising out of, based on or resulting from (1) the presence
or Release of, or exposure to, any Hazardous Material at any location, or (2)
the failure to comply with any Environmental Law; (B) "Environmental Law"
means any Law, Judgment, legally binding agreement or Permit issued,

health and safety or the protection of endangered or threatened species; (C)
"Hazardous Materials" means any petroleum or petroleum products, radioactive

(l) Employee Benefits Matters. (i) Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company Letter
sets forth a list of all "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")), all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) (each, a "Pension Plan") and all other Benefit Plans
and Benefit Agreements that, in each case, are in effect as of the date of
this Agreement. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of (A) each Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement (or, in
the case of any unwritten Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements, written
descriptions thereof and, in the case of offer letters and employment
agreements with employees in Canada, the forms of the same), including any
amendments



thereto, (B) the two most recent annual reports, or such similar reports,
statements, information returns or material correspondence required to be
filed with or delivered to any Governmental Entity, if any, with respect to
each Benefit Plan (including reports filed on Form 5500 with accompanying
schedules and attachments), (C) the most recent summary plan description (if
any), and any summary of material modifications, prepared for each Benefit
Plan for which a summary plan description is required under applicable Law,
(D) each trust agreement and group annuity or insurance Contract and other
documents relating to the funding or payment of compensation or benefits under
each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement (if any) and (E) the two most recent
actuarial valuations for each Benefit Plan (if any). Each Benefit Plan and
Benefit Agreement has been administered, funded and invested in all material
respects in accordance with its terms. The Company and its Subsidiaries and
each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement are in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, and the terms of
any collective bargaining agreements or other labor union Contracts.

(ii) Each Pension Plan intended to be tax qualified under the Code is so
qualified and has been the subject of a favorable determination, advisory,
qualification or opinion letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS") with respect to all tax Law changes with respect to which the IRS is
currently willing to provide a determination, advisory or opinion letter to
the effect that such Pension Plan is qualified and exempt from United States
Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the
Code, and no such letter has been revoked (nor, as of the date of this
Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the
date of the most recent such letter or application therefor relating to any
such Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification of such Pension Plan or increase the costs relating thereto or
require security under Section 307 of ERISA. Each Benefit Plan required to
have been approved by any non‑United States Governmental Entity (or permitted
to have been approved to obtain any beneficial tax or other status) has been
so approved or timely submitted for approval, no such approval has been
revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has revocation been
threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent
approval or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that would
reasonably be expected to affect any such approval relating thereto or
increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has delivered to Parent a
complete and correct copy of the most recent determination, qualification,
opinion or approval letter or similar document received from a Governmental
Entity with respect to each Benefit Plan intended to qualify for favorable tax
treatment or other status, as well as a complete and correct copy of each
pending application for a determination, advisory, qualification or approval
letter or similar document, if any, and a list of all amendments to any such
Benefit



Plans as to which a favorable determination, qualification or approval letter
has not yet been received.

(iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or been obligated to sponsor, maintain or
contribute to, or has any actual or contingent liability under, any Benefit
Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA)
or a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA),
or that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code or that is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan, and neither the
Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity could incur any liability with
respect to any such plan (under Title IV of ERISA or otherwise).

(iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that provides welfare benefits,
whether or not subject to ERISA (each, a "Welfare Plan"), is funded through a
"welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code). There are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or
oral, that would prevent any Welfare Plan (including any Welfare Plan covering
retirees or other former employees) from being amended or terminated without
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or at any time
after the Effective Time. No Welfare Plan provides benefits, and there are no
understandings, written or oral, with respect to the provision of welfare
benefits, after termination of employment, except where the cost thereof is
borne entirely by the former employee (or his or her eligible dependents or
beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar
state statute or foreign Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f)
of the Code, Sections 601-609 of ERISA and any similar state statute or
foreign Law with respect to each Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan"
(as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or any similar state statute).

(v) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the
Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or as a result of
any termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will, except
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, result in any breach or violation
of, or a default under, any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement. Except as
expressly set forth in Section 5.04, none of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval or the consummation
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (whether
alone or as a result of any termination of employment on or following the
Effective Time) will (A) entitle any Company Personnel to severance,
termination, retention, change in control or similar compensation



or benefits or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

(vi) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to each Benefit
Plan required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or distributed to any
Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or distributed,
except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no, pending investigations by
any Governmental Entity with respect to, or pending termination proceedings or
other material claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal
operation of the Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements), suits or proceedings
against or involving or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under, any
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

(vii) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection
with each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement that are required to have been
made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of
such Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement and applicable Laws have been timely
made.

(viii) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) that could subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective directors, officers or employees to any material
liability and (B) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers or employees or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any agent of any of the foregoing, has engaged in any transaction or
acted in a manner, or failed to act in a manner, that could subject the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers or employees to any material liability for breach of fiduciary duty
under ERISA or any other applicable Law. No Benefit Plan or related trust has
been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event" (as such term is
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement
has not been waived with respect to any Benefit Plan during the last five
years, and no notice of a reportable event will be required to be filed in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ix) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability or obligations, including under or on account
of a Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons
to provide services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and



treating such persons as consultants or independent contractors and not as
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(x) Each Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section
1.409A-1(a)(1)(a) (a "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan") (A) was
operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code between January 1, 2005
and December 31, 2008, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of
(1) Section 409A of the Code and (2) the final Treasury Regulations and other
guidance issued by the IRS thereunder, to the extent applicable (clauses (1)
and (2), together, the "409A Authorities") and (B) has been operated in
compliance with the 409A Authorities since January 1, 2009. Each Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan has been in documentary compliance with the 409A
Authorities since January 1, 2009.

(m) Taxes. (i) For the purposes of this Agreement, (A) "taxes" shall include
all (1) Federal, state, local and foreign taxes, assessments, duties
(including customs duties), levies, tariffs or similar charges of any kind
whatsoever (including any escheat and unclaimed property obligations) and any
interest, penalties or additions imposed with respect thereto, (2) liability
for the payment of any amounts of the types described in clause (1) as a
result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or
aggregate group and (3) liability for the payment of any amounts as a result
of transferee or successor liability with respect to the payment of any
amounts of the type described in clause (1) or (2); (B) "taxing authority"
means any Governmental Entity exercising regulatory authority in respect of
any taxes; and (C) "tax return" means any Federal, state, local or foreign

return, statement or other document in each case relating to taxes (including
any related or supporting information with respect thereto, any certificate,
schedule or attachment thereto and including any amendment thereof).

(ii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all material
tax returns required to be filed in the manner prescribed by applicable Law.
All such tax returns are complete and correct in all material respects. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely paid all material taxes due
from it or them, except for Taxes being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been made, and, in accordance
with GAAP, the most recent financial statements contained in the Filed SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material taxes payable by the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial statements. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has requested any extension of time within which to file any
tax return which tax return has not yet been filed.



(iii) No tax return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has ever
been under audit or examination by any taxing authority, and no notice of such
an audit or examination has been received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Each assessed deficiency resulting from any audit or examination
relating to taxes by any taxing authority has been timely paid (or is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and has been reserved for
by the Company in accordance with GAAP) and there is no material deficiency,
refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect
to any taxes due and owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The tax
returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been examined by the relevant
taxing authority for the fiscal years set forth in Section 3.01(m)(iii) of the
Company Letter. The relevant statute of limitations is closed with respect to
all tax returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all fiscal years
through the fiscal year ended February 1, 2009.

having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or collection of any
taxes.

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for
taxes not yet due.

by or currently has any liability under any tax sharing agreement, tax
indemnity obligation or similar agreement, arrangement or practice with
respect to taxes (including any similar agreement with any taxing authority).

(vii) Neither of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include in a taxable period ending after the Effective Time (i) taxable income
attributable to income that accrued (for purposes of the financial statements
of the Company included in the Filed SEC Documents) in a taxable period prior
to the Effective Time but was not recognized for tax purposes in such prior

properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancelations,
accelerations, losses, Liens, rights or entitlements that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to impair in any material
respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or prevent or materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by



this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required

York Stock Exchange and The NASDAQ Stock Market and (E) such other consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings and

the ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 4.02. No Solicitation. (a) Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company (i) shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
advisor or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal or (B) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person (or any
representative thereof) any information with respect to, or otherwise
knowingly cooperate in any way with any person (or any representative thereof)
with respect to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
activities, discussions and negotiations with any person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Takeover Proposal and (iii) shall promptly, and in any
event within two days following the date of this Agreement, request, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the prompt return or written
acknowledgment of destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished to such parties or their representatives in connection with any
Takeover Proposal to the extent that the Company is entitled to have such
documents returned or destroyed; provided, however, that at any time prior to
obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written
unsolicited Takeover Proposal received after the execution of this Agreement
by each of the parties hereto that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of
this Section 4.02 or any other provision of this Agreement, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, the Company may, and may permit and authorize its
Subsidiaries and its representatives and its Subsidiaries' representatives to,
in each case subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c) and the other
provisions of this Agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which contains
terms that are in all material respects no less restrictive of such person
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an "Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement"); provided that all such information had been
provided, or is concurrently provided, to Parent, and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with, and only with, the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of
the



Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 4.02(a) by the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Takeover Proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or "group" (as defined in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent or Sub or any of their
affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution involving
the Company or any direct or indirect acquisition, including by way of any
merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or similar
transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 20% or
more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest
expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company
which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets or businesses
referred to in clause (i) above.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any binding
bona fide unsolicited written offer which did not result from a breach of
Section 4.02(a) made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their
affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such person (or, in the case
of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the stockholders of
such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting
power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel), (i) provides a higher value to the stockholders of the
Company than the consideration payable in the Merger (taking into account all
of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal.

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this
Agreement or the Merger (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such
action being referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii)
recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare advisable the
approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any
such action, or adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause or
permit the



Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
(each, an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or resolve or agree to take any such
action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may (x) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) in response to a Superior Proposal, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) to accept such Superior Proposal,
in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), if the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
provided that the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(f) unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided
written notice to Parent (an "Adverse Change Notice") at least three business
days prior to such action that it is prepared to take such action and, if such
action is in response to a Superior Proposal, the following additional
conditions are satisfied: (A) such notice shall attach the most current
version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes
such Superior Proposal and (B) Parent does not make, within three business
days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after
consultation with a financial advisor of national reputation and outside legal
counsel), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment or modification of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Adverse Change Notice and a new three business day period). The Company agrees
that, during the three business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination pursuant to Section 7.01(f), the Company
and its officers, directors and representatives shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its officers, directors and representatives regarding any
revisions to the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement proposed by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to enter into any
agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to
a Superior Proposal unless this Agreement has been terminated by its terms
pursuant to Section 7.01, and, if required pursuant to Section 5.07, the
Company has paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall, as promptly as possible and
in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally
and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or
inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a
Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other
modification to such terms and conditions) and the



identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry.
Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above, the Company (or
its outside counsel) shall keep Parent (or its outside counsel) reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and material details of
any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any material change
to its material terms and conditions).

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that in
no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof
take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 4.02.

SECTION 4.03. Conduct by Parent. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the
Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
(including Sub) to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to
result in (a) any representation and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in
this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue (as so
qualified) or (b) any such representation and warranty that is not so
qualified becoming untrue in any material respect.

ARTICLE V

Additional Agreements

SECTION 5.01. Stockholder Consent; Preparation of the Information Statement.
(a) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement and in lieu of calling a
meeting of the Company's stockholders, the Company shall submit a form of
irrevocable written consent attached hereto as Exhibit B to record holders of
at least 70% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such written
consent, as duly executed and delivered by all such record holders, the
"Stockholder Consent"). As soon as practicable upon receipt of the Stockholder
Consent, the Company will provide Parent with a facsimile copy of such
Stockholder Consent, certified as true and complete by an executive officer of
the Company. In connection with the Stockholder Consent, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to comply, and shall comply in all respects, with
the DGCL, including Section 228 and Section 262 thereof, the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within 10 days of the date hereof), the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC a written information statement of the type contemplated by
Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act containing the information specified in
Schedule 14C under the Exchange



Act concerning the Stockholder Consent, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Information Statement"). Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such person to the
other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Information Statement. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Information Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Information Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response and (ii) shall include in
such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at
any time prior to the date that is 20 days after the Information Statement is
first mailed to the Company's stockholders, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement, so that the
Information Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.

(c) The Company agrees that the Information Statement will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that
none of the information included or incorporated by reference in the
Information Statement will, at the date the Information Statement is filed
with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company, or at the time of
any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the
Information Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf
of Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein.
Parent agrees that none of such information will, at the date the Information
Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company,
or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.



(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Information Statement to be (i) filed with the SEC in definitive form as
contemplated by Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and (ii) mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, in each case as promptly as practicable after,
and in any event within two days after, the latest of (A) confirmation from
the SEC that it has no further comments on the Information Statement, (ii)
confirmation from the SEC that the Information Statement is otherwise not to
be reviewed or (iii) expiration of the 10-day period after filing in the event
the SEC does not review the Information Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant
to this Section 5.01(d) shall not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation
Change or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or any other person of any Takeover Proposal.

SECTION 5.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Subject to
compliance with applicable Law (including antitrust and competition Laws) and
appropriate disclosure limitations to maintain attorney-client privilege, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent
and to Parent's officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants and other representatives and advisors full access
upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all
their respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits,
documents, information, directors, officers and employees, and during such
period the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish
to Parent any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably
request (including the work papers of Grant Thornton LLP). Following the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not
be required to), following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and
interview any Company Personnel and review the personnel records and such
other information concerning the Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably
request, provided such review is permissible under applicable Law. No
investigation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives and no other receipt of information by Parent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other advisors or representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision of
this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under the
Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will
hold, and will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors and representatives to hold, any and all
information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. Any request for information or contact pursuant to
this Section 5.02(a) shall be directed to (or in a manner approved by) an
executive officer of the Company.



(b) Subject to applicable law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate to ensure an orderly
transition and integration process in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the
disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.03. Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Consultation and Notice. (a)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental
Entities and other persons and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act and other
registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental
Entities, if any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any
supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity, including
participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its
review of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity or third party and (v) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from any third party. In connection with and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of
Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Sub
be obligated to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not without the
prior written consent of Parent, agree or proffer to divest or hold separate,
or enter into any licensing, business restriction or similar arrangement with
respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any portion of any
business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to
litigate or participate in the litigation of any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by
any Governmental Entity (A) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries any
damages in relation therewith; (B) seeking to prohibit or limit



in any respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates of all or any portion of
the business or assets or any product of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Parent or its Subsidiaries or to require any such person to dispose of,
license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold
separate all or any portion of the business or assets or any product of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, in each case as a
result of or in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (C) seeking to directly or indirectly impose
limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to acquire or
hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of Company Common
Stock or any shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation or any of
Parent's Subsidiaries, including the right to vote Company Common Stock or the
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of Parent's Subsidiaries,
respectively; or (D) seeking to (1) directly or indirectly prohibit Parent or
any of its affiliates from effectively controlling in any respect any of the
business or operations of the Company or its or Parent's Subsidiaries or (2)
directly or indirectly prevent the Company or its or Parent's Subsidiaries
from operating any of their respective businesses in substantially the same
manner as operated by the Company and its or Parent's Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other in advance of, and reasonably consider each other's views
concerning, all material communications, whether written or oral, with a
Governmental Entity regarding this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the relevant Governmental
Entity's permission, each of Parent and the Company shall provide the other
person advance notice of, and permit the other person to attend and
participate in, all meetings, conferences and material communications with a
Governmental Entity regarding this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall timely pay all administrative
filing fees associated with the filings, registrations, declarations, notices
and other submissions required to be made in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or
any other Law relating to merger control or designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization, restraint of
trade or substantial lessening of competition.

(b) (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good
faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material,
individually or in the aggregate, operational developments, the general status
of relationships with customers, suppliers, Franchisees and resellers, the
general status of ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by
Parent pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Parent; provided,
however, that no such consultation shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision in
this Agreement, or



the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of:

(A) the occurrence of any matter or event that has resulted or, if left
uncured, would reasonably be expected to result, in any condition to the
transactions contemplated hereby and set forth in Section 6.02 not being
satisfied;

(B) any written notice or other communication from any person (other than a
Governmental Entity) alleging that notice to or consent of such person is
required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

(C) any written notice or other communication from any distributor, Major
Vendor, Franchisee or reseller to the effect that such distributor, Major
Vendor, Franchisee or reseller is terminating or otherwise materially
adversely modifying its relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

(D) any material written notice or other material communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and a copy of any such notice or communication
shall be furnished to Parent, together with the Company's written notice;

(E) any filing or notice made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and a copy of any such filing or notice shall be furnished to
Parent together with the Company's written notice; and

(F) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.01(g) or that relate to the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

provided, however, that no such notification shall operate as a waiver or
otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other



provision in this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

(iii) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (A) any representation
or warranty made by Parent or Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue
or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) could not
be satisfied or (B) the failure of Parent or Sub to perform in any material
respect any obligation to be performed by such party under this Agreement such
that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b) could not be satisfied;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity (at its own expense) to participate in the defense of
any litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will obtain the
prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such
claim, it being understood and agreed that this Section 5.03(c) shall not give
Parent the right to direct such defense.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, to the extent requested by the other party and subject to compliance
with applicable Law, to cooperate with and assist such party in (i)
communicating or negotiating with the Franchisees of the parties in connection
with the Merger and (ii) any litigation or threatened litigation involving
Franchisees of the parties in connection with the Merger.

(e) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each
of the parties hereto, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub, will adopt this
Agreement.

SECTION 5.04. Equity Awards. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
(including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the
following:

(i) fully vest all Stock Options that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and adjust the terms of all such Stock Options as necessary to
provide that, at the Effective Time, each Stock Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, in accordance with any applicable Company
Stock Plan or any applicable award agreement thereunder, be canceled and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in full satisfaction of the rights
of such



holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Stock Option, which amount shall be payable to such holder at
or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (excluding, in the case
of the Specified Stockholders, the Per Share Escrow Amount). For the avoidance
of doubt, all Stock Options with an exercise price equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration will be canceled at the Effective Time and the
holders of such Stock Options will not have any right to receive any
consideration in respect thereof; and

(ii) the Company shall ensure prior to the Effective Time that, following the
Effective Time, there shall be no rights to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock, Stock Options or any other interests in respect of any capital stock
(including any phantom stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation.

(b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be subject to any
required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest.

(c) The Company shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.04 and any other dispositions
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection
with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the
Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 5.05. Employee Matters. (a) For a period of one year after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
(i) provide base cash compensation to the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who are employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") that is
no less favorable than the base cash compensation in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (ii) (x) provide employee benefit plans and
arrangements and paid time off accrual (including bonus and incentive
opportunities (but excluding equity-based compensation) to Continuing
Employees that are substantially comparable to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and (y) consider Continuing Employees for equity-
based compensation grants at the same time and levels as similarly situated
employees of Parent; provided, that (1) in no event shall any Continuing
Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries; (2) Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as administratively feasible
after the Closing Date; and (3) until such time as Parent shall cause the
Continuing Employees to participate in the employee benefit plans and



arrangements that are made available to similarly situated employees of Parent
or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), a
Continuing Employee's continued participation in the employee benefit plans
and arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that
participation in the Parent plans and arrangements may commence at different
times with respect to each Parent plan and arrangement). Nothing in this
Section 5.05(a) is intended to or shall create any right in any employee,
consultant or contractor of the Company to continued employment by or service
to Parent, the Company, the Sub, or, in each case, any affiliate or Subsidiary
thereof, or limit the ability of Parent, the Company, the Sub, or, in each
case, any affiliate or Subsidiary thereof, to terminate the employment or
service of any employee, consultant or contractor of the Company for any
reason. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 5.05(a), Parent shall or shall cause its appropriate Subsidiary to
honor the Continuing Employee's accrued paid time off as of the Closing.

(b) To the extent that a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate
in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such employee
benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Continuing Employee with the
Company or its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and, except under defined benefit pension
plans, benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately
prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that such recognition of service (A) shall not
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with respect to the
same period of service, and (B) shall not apply for purposes of any plan,
program or arrangement under which similarly-situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service; and (ii) with
respect to any health, dental, vision plan or other welfare plan of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (any
such plan, a "Parent Welfare Plan") in which any Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is
first eligible to participate, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x)
cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such Parent Welfare Plan or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to
such Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived
or satisfied under the Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any
health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee in the
year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.



(c) The Company shall terminate the Teavana Corporation Retirement Savings
Plan and any other Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a qualified
plan under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (each such Benefit Plan, a
"Company 401(k) Plan") by board resolution effective no later than the day
before the Closing Date (such date of termination, the "DC Termination Date"),
unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and
maintain (or to cause an affiliate of Parent, including the Company, to
sponsor and maintain such plan by providing the Company with written notice of
such election prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
that each Company 401(k) Plan with respect to which Parent has not provided
the notice specified in the immediately preceding sentence (i) has been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company's board of directors (or
other governing body), as applicable, effective not later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii) has adopted and executed an
amendment sufficient to ensure compliance with all applicable requirements of
the Code and ERISA and any other applicable Law. The form and substance of
such resolutions and amendment shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld. If the Company has
terminated a Company 401(k) Plan as provided in this Section 5.05(c), Parent
shall cause each Continuing Employee who was a participant in such Company
401(k) Plan and who has an account balance under such Company 401(k) Plan to
be permitted to roll over his or her "eligible rollover distribution," as
defined under Section 402(c)(4) of the Code, in the form of cash and
promissory notes relating to outstanding participant loans from such Company
401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, provided that, Parent or the proper
fiduciaries of the Parent 401(k) Plan become reasonably satisfied, consistent
with the regulations under Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and ERISA and any
other applicable Law, that such terminated Company 401(k) Plan meets the
requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code and the
requirements of the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(d) This Section 5.05 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
5.05, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former directors,
officers, employees, contractors or consultants of any of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.05 or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to
or modification of any employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
respective Subsidiary thereof.

SECTION 5.06. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) Parent and Sub
agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws



(or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other
agreements of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and set
forth in Section 5.06 of the Company Letter (the "Scheduled Indemnity
Agreements") shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with and honor the
foregoing obligations.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (and their successors) shall maintain for a period of not less
than six years from and after the Effective Time any provisions in the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement
concerning the indemnification and exculpation (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' current or
former directors or officers, or provisions that are no less favorable to
those persons than the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws
and other organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, and such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to such
indemnified party, except as required by applicable Law or except to make such
provisions more favorable to those persons.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other corporation or entity and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of the consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six year "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy effective for claims
asserted for a six year period after the Effective Time covering each person
currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy of the Company
in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall, prior to the
Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such entire six-year period; provided
that the Company shall not pay aggregate premiums (with respect to the entire
six-year period) for such policy in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage (the "Maximum Premium").
If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained
at an aggregate premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Company will
acquire the most advantageous policy obtainable for an aggregate premium equal
to the Maximum Premium.



(e) The rights of each indemnified party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such indemnified party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Scheduled Indemnity
Agreement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.06 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and are expressly intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the indemnified parties
and shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
successors and assigns.

SECTION 5.07. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as expressly set forth in this
Section 5.07 and Section 5.03(a), all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal has been made (whether or not
conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to the Company or its stockholders
or any person has announced an intention (whether or not conditional and
whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover Proposal
(whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) otherwise becomes
known to the Company or the stockholders of the Company and thereafter (A)
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(i) and (B) prior to the date that is 12 months after such
termination, (1) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any
Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (2) any
Takeover Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes of this Section
5.07(b)(i)(B), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth
in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a) except
that all references to 20% shall be deemed references to 50%), (ii) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or (iii) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), then, in
each such case, the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $18,400,000 (the
"Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of a
termination by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within two business days
after such termination, (y) in the case of a termination by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(f), no later than the time of such termination and
(z) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section
5.07(b)(i)(B), no later than the first to occur of the events referred to in
clauses (1) and (2) above, in each case to an account designated by Parent.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(c) or 7.01(g) or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f),
then, in each case, the Company shall pay Parent or its designees by wire
transfer of same day funds, as promptly as possible (but in any event within
two business days) following the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor,
all reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent,
Sub and their respective affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Parent Expenses"); provided that the



Company shall not be required to pay more than an aggregate of $3,500,000 in
fees and expenses pursuant to this Section 5.07(c).

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
5.07 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 5.07 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this Section 5.07, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.07 at the prime lending
rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

SECTION 5.08. Public Announcements. The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Each of
the Company and Parent shall consult with the other party before making, and
give such party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without such party's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system.

SECTION 5.09. Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation of all the directors of the Company and any Subsidiary of the
Company, effective at the Effective Time.

Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange
Act to exempt from Section 16 of the Exchange Act the disposition of shares of
Company Common Stock and "derivative securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c)
under the Exchange Act) with respect to shares of Company Common Stock by
officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

ARTICLE VII

Section 5.07, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII and except



for any intentional and material breach by a party of any of its

Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.07(b) or Parent Expenses pursuant to
Section 5.07(c)).

SECTION 7.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time, whether before or after the Stockholder Approval has been

stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

SECTION 7.04. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party which specifically sets forth the terms
of such extension or waiver. The failure or delay by any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial

purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and

of the parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such person's respective address set forth above shall be
effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State
of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to

by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court
of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in
any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

SECTION 8.12. Consents and Approvals. For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and
delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party to do
so.

SECTION 8.13. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision hereof and the
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 14, 2012
(the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Starbucks Corporation, a Washington
corporation ("Parent"), Taj Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Teavana Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), Parent shall acquire the common stock of the
Company.

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
provides that a transferee of a United States real property interest must
withhold tax if the transferor is not a United States person. In order to
confirm that Parent, as transferee, is not required to withhold tax upon the
closing of the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement, the
undersigned, in his capacity as [chief executive officer], herby certifies on
behalf of the Company as follows:

1. The common stock of the Company does not constitute a "United States real property interest" (as defined in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code);

2. The determination in paragraph 1, above, is based on a determination by the Company that it is not and has not been a "United States real property holding corporation" (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A) of the Code;

3. The Company's U.S. employer identification number is [●];

4. The Company's address is:

[●]



This certification is made in accordance with the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h)(2) and 1.1445-2(c)(3). I understand that this
certification may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by the
transferee and that any false statements contained herein could be punished by
fine, imprisonment or both.

[Signature Page Follows]



Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of
the Company.
