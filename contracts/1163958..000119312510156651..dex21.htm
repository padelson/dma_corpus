Assets, any Contract, Medicaid provider number, Medicare provider number or

obligations intended to be assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement and the
Sellers Documents, and to otherwise make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

actuarial report, if any, prepared by the Employee Plans enrolled actuary,
(iv) the current summary plan descriptions for each Employee Plan required to
prepare, file and distribute summary plan descriptions, (v) all summaries
furnished to Employees, officers or directors of the Sellers of all incentive
compensation, other plans and fringe benefits for which a summary
plan description is not required and (vi) the form notifications to Employees
of their rights under Section 4980B of the Code.

 

(b) None of the Employee Plans is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA), is or has been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA, or is or has been subject to subject to Title IV of ERISA or Code
Section 412 or 430. Neither Sellers nor any of their ERISA Affiliates have any
Liability under Title IV of ERISA or Code Section 412 or 430. None of the
Employee Plans is subject to any Laws outside of the United States.

(c) Each Employee Plan has been established, administered and invested in
accordance with its material terms and is in material compliance with all
applicable Laws. The Sellers have performed and complied in all material
respects with all of their respective obligations under or with respect to
the Employee Plans. Each Employee Plan that is intended to be a "qualified
plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Qualified Plan_ ")
and each trust that is intended to be exempt under Section 501 of the Code ("
_Exempt Trust_ ") has received a determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Qualified Plan is so
qualified and such Exempt Trust is so exempt, and, to Sellers Knowledge,
nothing has occurred since the date of the most recent Internal Revenue
Service determination or opinion letter, as applicable, that would materially
and adversely affect the tax-qualified status of any Qualified Plan or Exempt
Trust.



 

37 (d) There is no action, order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree
outstanding or proceeding, arbitral action, governmental audit, or
investigation relating to, or seeking benefits under, any Employee Plan that
is pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened against any of Sellers
(other than any claims for benefits under the Employee Plans in the Ordinary
Course of Business). None of Sellers, or to the Knowledge of Sellers, any
fiduciary of any Employee Plan, has any material liability with respect to any
transaction in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or any "prohibited
transaction," as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code, for which no
exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(2) or (d) of
the Code.

 

(e) No Employee Plan provides post-retirement or post-termination employee
benefits (including death, medical or health benefits) to or in respect of
any Employees or former Employees or their beneficiaries, and none of Sellers
has any obligation to provide such benefits other than COBRA Continuation
Coverage. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.17(e)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, no Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not
fully insured through an insurance Contract. All contributions or premiums
required to be made by Sellers to or under each Employee Plan have been made
in a timely fashion in accordance with applicable Law, the terms of the
applicable Employee Plan and any applicable collective bargaining agreement,
and no Seller has, and as of the Closing Date will not have, any actual or
potential unfunded Liabilities with respect to any Employee Plans.

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Code §280G (or any corresponding provision of state, local, or foreign Tax
law) or in the imposition of an excise tax under Code Section 4999, (or any
corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law).

 

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in conjunction with
any other event) will result in forgiveness of Indebtedness or the
acceleration or creation of any rights of any person to benefits under any
Assumed Plan (including the acceleration of the accrual or vesting of any
benefits under any such Employee Plan or the acceleration or creation of any
rights under any employment, severance, retention, parachute or change in
control agreement or the right to receive any transaction bonus or other
similar payment) or the obligation to take action to secure any benefits
payable under any Assumed Plan.



 

38 5.18 _Parents_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.18_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, MSNH and MSH are not party to any Contracts

and less than two percent (2%) of the stock of which is beneficially owned by
such shareholders, officers or directors in the aggregate), or (c) Affiliate
of any of the foregoing is a party to: (i) any Contract with, or relating to,
Sellers, their respective businesses, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities; or (ii) any property (real, personal or mixed, tangible or

5.19_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule also sets forth a true, correct and
complete list of all accounts receivable, notes receivable and other
receivables and accounts payable owed to or due from any such Person

(the " _Insurance Policies_ "). All such policies (or substitute policies with
substantially similar terms and underwritten by insurance carriers with
substantially similar or higher ratings) are in full force and effect, all
premiums with respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the
Execution Date have been paid, and no written notice of cancellation or
termination (or any other threatened termination) has been received with
respect to any such policy. Except as set forth on _Section 5.20(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no pending, or to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened claims, or circumstances that might give rise to a claim, under any
Insurance Policy. All claims relating to the Purchaser, the Business or any
of the Assets under the Insurance Policies have been filed in a due and timely
fashion and any such claims that are pending are included in the Assets. No
notice of cancellation or nonrenewal with respect to, disallowance of any
claim, or reservation of rights with respect to any claim under, or increase
of premium for, any Insurance Policy has been received by Sellers.

 

(b) Insurance policies under which Sellers, the Business or any of the
Purchased Assets are insured that are provided by or on behalf of vendors,
contractors or third party service providers (collectively, the " _Third Party

effect in accordance with the requirements therefor under the
applicable Contracts. Immediately following Closing, Purchasers will have the
ability to directly make claims under the Third Party Insurance Policies
related to Sellers, the Business (to the extent not specifically related to
the Excluded Assets) or the Purchased Assets pursuant to all of the rights
the Sellers had under the Third Party Insurance Policies immediately prior to
Closing.



 

39 (c) It is the intent of the parties that immediately following the Closing,
the Purchasers will have all the rights under the Insurance Policies and

any Seller at any location or by any other Person at, on or under the Leased
Real Property in any manner or concentration that requires investigation,
removal or remediation under Environmental Laws or would otherwise cause
any Seller or any future owner or operator of any Leased Real Property to
incur material liability under Environmental Laws, and (e) no Seller has
received any notice of or entered into any order, settlement, judgment,
injunction or decree involving uncompleted, outstanding or unresolved
material obligations, liabilities or requirements relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws.

Significant Customers and Significant Vendors/Suppliers. " _Significant
Customers_ " are: (a) the 25 customers that have purchased the most, in terms
of dollar value, services sold by the Business during the year ended December
27, 2009; and (b) the 25 customers that have purchased the most, in terms of

(i) has notified any Seller that the same no longer meets such Significant
Customers quality specifications or any certification requirements imposed
upon companies in the Business or (ii) has threatened to terminate such
Significant Customers Contract or relationship with Sellers. To the Sellers
Knowledge, during the three-month period immediately preceding the Execution

claims relating to the quality of Sellers services as compared with the
comparable period of the preceding calendar year. Except as set forth in
_Section 5.22_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no Acquired Customer,
Significant Customer or Significant Vendor/Supplier has proposed in writing,

Purchaser has relied upon its own investigation and analysis as well as the

otherwise modify any Assumed Plan following the Closing Date.

 

(b) Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Article VII_ with respect to current or former Employees
are included for the sole benefit of Sellers and the Purchaser, and that
nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including,

BANKRUPTCY COURT MATTERS

 

8.1 _Competing Bid and Other Matters_.

 

(a) On the Petition Date, Sellers shall file with the Bankruptcy Court an
application or motion seeking approval of (i) the Bidding Procedures Order
and (ii) the Sale Order and the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

(b) This Agreement, the parties obligations hereunder and the transactions
contemplated hereby are subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court and
Sellers right and ability to pursue and consider higher or otherwise better
competing bids with respect to the Business and a material portion of the
Purchased Assets pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order (each a " _Competing
Bid_ "). From and after the Petition Date until the conclusion of the Sale
Hearing, Sellers are permitted to, and may cause their Representatives and
Affiliates to, initiate contact with, provide information to, solicit or
encourage submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any Person (in
addition to the Purchaser and its Affiliates, agents and Representatives) in
connection with any sale or other disposition of the Business or a material
portion of the Purchased Assets or the continuation of the Business as a
reorganized, going-concern, subject only to the provisions of the
Bidding Procedures Order.

(c) From and after the Petition Date until the conclusion of the Sale Hearing,
Sellers shall have the responsibility and obligation to respond to any
inquiries or offers to purchase all or any part of the Business, and perform
any and all other acts related thereto which are required or permitted under
the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Law, including, without limitation,
supplying information relating to the Business and the assets of Sellers to
prospective purchasers, subject only to the provisions of the Bidding
Procedures Order.

 

(d) If an Auction is conducted, and the Purchaser is not the prevailing party
at the conclusion of such Auction (such prevailing party, the " _Prevailing
Bidder_ "), the Purchaser shall be required to serve as a back-up bidder (the
" _Back-up Bidder_ ") and keep the Purchasers bid to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon in the Auction) open
and irrevocable until the earlier of (i) 5:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern time)
on the date which is fifteen (15) days after the date of the entry by the
Bankruptcy Court of the Sale Order (the " _Outside Back-up Date_ ");
_provided,_ _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
the Outside Back-up Date be later than three business days after October 15,
2010 or (ii) the date of closing of an Alternative Transaction with the
Prevailing Bidder. Following the Sale Hearing and prior to the Outside Back-up
Date, if the Prevailing Bidder fails to consummate the applicable Alternative
Transaction as a result of a breach or failure to perform on the part of such
Prevailing Bidder, the Back-up Bidder (if the Back-up Bidder is the next
highest bidder at the Auction) will be deemed to have the new prevailing bid,
and Sellers will be authorized, but not required, without further order of
the Bankruptcy Court or any action on the part of the Back-up Bidder, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon in
the Auction) with the Back-up Bidder.

(e) The Sellers shall promptly serve true and correct copies of the Sale
Motion and all related pleadings in accordance with the Bidding Procedures
Order, the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the
Local Rules for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District
of Florida and any other applicable order of the Bankruptcy Court.

substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ and otherwise in
form and substance acceptable to Sellers and the Purchaser. The Sale Order
shall, among other things, (a) approve, pursuant to Sections 105, 363 and 365
of the Bankruptcy Code, (i) the execution, delivery and performance by
Sellers of this Agreement, (ii) the sale of the Purchased Assets to the
Purchaser on the terms set forth herein and free and clear of all Encumbrances
(other than Encumbrances included in the Assumed Liabilities and Permitted
Encumbrances), and (iii) the performance by Sellers of their respective
obligations under this Agreement; (b) authorize and empower Sellers to assume
and assign to the Purchaser the Assigned Contracts; and (c) find that
Purchaser is a "good faith" buyer within the meaning of Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code, not a successor to any Seller and grant the Purchaser the
protections of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Purchaser agrees

51 9.3 _Assignability of Certain Contracts, Etc_. To the extent that the
assignment to the Purchaser of any Assigned Contract pursuant to this
Agreement is not permitted without the consent of a third party and such
restriction cannot be effectively overridden or canceled by the Sale Order or
other related order of the Bankruptcy Court, then this Agreement will not be
deemed to constitute an assignment of or an undertaking or attempt to assign
such Assigned Contract or any right or interest therein unless and until such
consent is obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto will
use their commercially reasonable efforts, before the Closing, to obtain all
such consents; _provided_ , _further_ , that if any such consents are not

respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by

(d) Except as provided in _Section 9.3_, all of the Assigned Contracts set
forth on _Section 10.3(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure, shall (i) be in full
force and effect on the Closing Date, (ii) be assignable to the Purchaser
without the consent of the counterparty to such Assigned Contract for such

Costs through the funding provided by the DIP Lenders under the DIP Loan (or
creation of reserves therefor) in accordance with the Sale Order or otherwise.

 

(e) Sellers shall have delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Purchaser

58 ARTICLE XI.

 

TAXES

 

11.1 _Additional Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Any sales, use, purchase, transfer, franchise, deed, fixed asset, stamp,
documentary stamp, use or other Taxes and recording charges which may be
payable by reason of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets or the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein shall be borne and timely paid by Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Purchaser), protect, and save and hold the Purchaser harmless from and
against any and all claims, charges, interest or penalties assessed, imposed
or asserted in relation to any such Taxes.

(b) The Purchaser shall, within one-hundred twenty (120) days after the
Closing Date, prepare and deliver to MSN for its consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) a schedule allocating
the Purchase Price (and any other items that are required for federal income
tax purposes to be treated as part of the purchase price) among the Purchased
Assets (such schedule, the " _Allocation_ "). If MSN raises any objection to
the Allocation within twenty (20) days of the receipt thereof, the Purchaser
and MSN will negotiate in good faith to resolve such objection(s). The
Purchaser, Sellers and MSN shall report and file all Tax Returns (including
amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) consistent with the Allocation as
finally agreed upon, and shall take no position contrary thereto or
inconsistent therewith (including, without limitation, in any audits or
examinations by any Governmental Body or any other proceeding) without first
giving the other party prior written notice; provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall prevent Purchaser, MSN, or Sellers from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Body based upon or
arising out of the Allocation, and neither Purchaser, MSN or Sellers shall be
required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment
by any Governmental Body challenging such Allocation. The Purchaser, Sellers
and MSN shall cooperate in the filing of any forms (including Form 8594 under
Section 1060 of the Code) with respect to such Allocation, including any
amendments to such forms required pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
any adjustment to the Purchase Price. If and to the extent the parties are
unable to agree on such Allocation, the parties shall retain a
mutually agreed upon accounting firm of national repute to resolve such
dispute. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the terms and
provisions of this _Section 11.1(b)_ shall survive the Closing without
limitation.

 

ARTICLE XII.

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

12.1 _Payment of Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Sellers
and the Purchaser shall, subject to _Section 12.12_ below, bear their own
expenses incurred or to be incurred in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument
contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

59 12.2 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Survival of
Confidentiality_. The parties hereto agree that the representations and
warranties, and the covenants and agreements to be performed prior to the

upon, the Closing. The parties hereto agree that the covenants contained in
this Agreement to be performed at or after the Closing shall survive in
accordance with the terms of the particular covenant or until fully performed.

 

12.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including the

waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this
Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of
any party shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing
waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are
not exclusive of any other remedies provided by applicable Law.

 

12.4 _Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement
may be executed (by facsimile or PDF signature) in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,

MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

 



 

60 12.6 _Jurisdiction, Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WILL HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES HERETO AND
ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG THE PARTIES, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT IF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IS UNWILLING OR
UNABLE TO HEAR ANY SUCH DISPUTE, THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE

DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG THE PARTIES, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO

or to such other Persons or addresses as may be designated in writing by the
party to receive such notice.

 

12.8 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
Purchaser and, subject to entry of the Bidding Procedures Order (with respect
to the matters covered thereby) and the Sale Order, Sellers, and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
including, without limitation, any trustee or estate representative appointed
in the Chapter 11 Case or any successor Chapter 7 case. Nothing in this
Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person or entity not a party to this Agreement except
as provided below. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by Sellers or the Purchaser (by operation of
law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be
void; provided, that the Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder in whole or in part to one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Purchaser (subject to the next succeeding sentence). No assignment of any
obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such
obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to the Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless
the context otherwise requires.

12.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

62 12.10 _Injunctive Relief_.

 

(a) The parties agree that damages at Law may be an inadequate remedy for the
breach of any of the covenants, promises and agreements contained in this
Agreement by the Sellers, and, accordingly, the Purchaser shall be entitled to
injunctive relief with respect to any such breach, including without
limitation, specific performance of such covenants, promises or agreements or
an order enjoining the Purchaser from any threatened, or from the
continuation of any actual, breach of the covenants, promises or agreements
contained in this Agreement by the Sellers. The rights set forth in this
_Section 12.10_ shall be in addition to any other rights which the Purchaser
may have at Law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, except in the case of fraud by the Purchaser,
DIP Agent, DIP Lenders, First Lien Agent or First Lien Lenders or any of their
respective Affiliates or subsidiaries, the right of the Sellers to receive the
Purchaser Termination Fee as provided in _Section 4.6(b)_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Sellers against the Purchaser, DIP Agent, DIP
Lenders, First Lien Agent and First Lien Lenders and any of their respective
Affiliates or subsidiaries for any loss or damage suffered as a result of
Purchasers breach of this Agreement or termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 4.4(j)_, _Section 4.4(l)_ or pursuant to any other provision of
_Section 4.4_ due to the Purchasers breach of any of its obligations under
this Agreement and the Sellers are explicitly not entitled to (and hereby
waive) any other remedy, including specific performance, for damages suffered
by the Sellers as a result of the Purchasers breach of this Agreement or the
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

12.11 _Non Recourse_. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, no
past, present or future director, officer, employee, advisor, lawyer, agent,
representative, incorporator, member, partner or equityholder of any Seller or
the Purchaser shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
any Seller or the Purchaser under this Agreement or Sellers Documents or the
Purchasers Documents of or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

12.12 _No Waiver or Release_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
(other than the Purchaser Termination Fee described in _Section 4.6(b)_ of
this Agreement), all terms, conditions, covenants, representations and
warranties contained in the DIP Loan Documents or First Lien Loan Documents,
and all rights, powers and remedies of the DIP Agent, the DIP Lenders, the
First Lien Agent and First Lien Lenders and all of the obligations of the
Debtors (as defined in the DIP Loan Documents or First Lien Loan Documents, as
applicable) and other Loan Parties (as defined in the DIP Loan Documents or
First Lien Loan Documents, as applicable) thereunder (including, without
limitation, the obligation to reimburse the First Lien Agent and First Lien
Lenders for fees and expenses incurred in connection with preparation and
negotiation of this Agreement to the extent set forth therein), are reserved
and are not amended, modified, limited or otherwise affected by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

63 12.13 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in the performance of each
of the obligations of the parties and with respect to all covenants and
conditions to be satisfied by the parties in this Agreement and all documents,
acknowledgments and instruments delivered in connection herewith.

 

12.14 _Certain Interpretations_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the
following rules of interpretation shall apply:

 

(i) All references in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Schedules and
Exhibits shall be deemed to refer to Articles, Sections, Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement.

(ii) All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement. 

(iii) The Article, Section and paragraph captions herein are for convenience
of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 

(iv) The words "include," "includes" and "including," when used herein shall
be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation"
(regardless or whether such words or similar words actually appear).

 

(v) When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded.

 

(vi) Any reference in this Agreement to $ shall mean U.S. dollars.

 

(vii) Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include all genders, and
words imparting the singular number only shall include the plural and vice
versa.

(viii) The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and "hereunder"
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which
such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal counsel
during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive
the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 



 

64 (c) Purchaser acknowledges hereby that Sellers may not comply with the
provisions of any bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
