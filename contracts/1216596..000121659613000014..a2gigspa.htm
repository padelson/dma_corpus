other time and place as the parties hereto may agree. The date the Closing

II. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE



2.1 Estimated Closing Statement. Not less than three Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, Seller will deliver to Buyer a written statement
containing Seller\'s calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price and setting
forth (i) the projected Net Working Capital of the Company and its Subsidiary
as of 11:59 p.m. Mountain Time on the date immediately prior to the Closing
Date (the "Estimated Net Working Capital") and (ii) the amount of Indebtedness
of the Company and its Subsidiary estimated to be outstanding as of 11:59 p.m.
Mountain Time on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Indebtedness") (such written statement, the "Estimated Closing
Statement").



2.2 Closing Payments. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing
by Seller, an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price. The "Estimated
Purchase Price" means an amount equal to $135,000,000 (i) plus the amount, if
any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Working
Capital, (ii) minus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than the Target Working Capital and (iii) minus the amount of
Estimated Indebtedness.



2.3 Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing Date, and in any event within 60 calendar days thereafter, Buyer
will prepare and deliver to Seller a written statement containing Buyer\'s
calculation of (i) the Net Working Capital of the Company and its Subsidiary
as of 11:59 p.m. Mountain Time on the date immediately prior to the Closing
Date (the "Proposed Final Net Working Capital") and (ii) the amount of
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiary outstanding as of 11:59 p.m.
Mountain Time on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Proposed
Final Indebtedness") (such written statement, the "Proposed Final Closing
Statement").



(b) Following the Closing, Buyer will provide Seller and its representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice to
the records, properties, personnel and auditors of the Company and its
Subsidiary to the extent relevant to the Seller\'s review of the Proposed
Final Closing Statement, and will cause the personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiary, including their respective officers, to reasonably cooperate with
Seller in connection therewith.



(c) If Seller disagrees with the calculation of any applicable amounts set
forth in the Proposed Final Closing Statement, it will notify Buyer of such
disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of
such disagreement, within 60 days after the delivery by Buyer of the Proposed
Final Closing Statement (any such disagreements so notified in writing within
such timeframe, the "Specified Items"). In the event that Seller does not
provide such a notice of disagreement within such 60-day period, Seller will
be deemed to have accepted the Proposed Final Closing Statement. In the event
a notice of disagreement is timely provided with respect to the Proposed Final
Closing Statement, Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts
for a period of 45 days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any applicable Specified Items. If, at the end of such period, they
are unable to resolve any such Specified Items, then PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (or (i) in the event Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP is unwilling or unable to
accept such engagement, Grant Thornton LLP or (ii) such other independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by
Buyer and Seller) (the "Accounting Firm") will resolve any 

remaining disagreements. The Accounting Firm will determine as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within 30 days of the date on which such dispute
is referred to the Accounting Firm, whether the items in the Proposed Final
Closing Statement subject to dispute were prepared in accordance with the
standards set forth in the definitions of Net Working Capital and Indebtedness
and whether and to what extent (if any) the applicable Proposed Final Closing
Statement requires adjustment. The determinations of the Accounting Firm will
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The Accounting Firm
will act to resolve only the Specified Items that remain unresolved at the
time of the Accounting Firm\'s determination, and will resolve the dispute
over such unresolved Specified Items based on the submissions of Buyer and
Seller, without audit or discovery, and may not assign a value to any
particular item that is greater than the greatest value for such item claimed
by either party in dispute or less than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either party in dispute, in each case as presented to the Accounting Firm.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be borne on a proportionate
basis by Seller on the one hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand, by the
parties based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to such Person bears to the amount actually contested by such Person,
as finally determined by the Accounting Firm.



(d) The Net Working Capital and Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiary, in each case as of 11:59 p.m. Mountain Time on the date
immediately prior to the Closing Date, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.3, are referred to herein as the "Final Net Working Capital" and the
"Final Indebtedness". The "Purchase Price" means an amount equal to
$135,000,000 (i) plus the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working
Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital, (ii) minus the amount, if any, by
which the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital
and (iii) minus the amount of Final Indebtedness.



(i) If the Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then
within two Business Days after the Purchase Price has been finally determined,
Buyer will pay or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, to Seller, an amount equal to the Purchase Price minus the Estimated
Purchase Price.



(ii) If the Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then
within two Business Days after the Purchase Price has been finally determined,
Seller will pay or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, to Buyer, an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price minus the
Purchase Price.

5.2 Access to Information. (a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives will be permitted to make,
during normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice, such investigation
of the properties, business and operations of the Company or its Subsidiary
(including reasonable access to the personnel, counsel, accountants,
consultants and representatives thereof) and such examination of the books and
records of the Company or its Subsidiary as, in each case, it reasonably
requests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiary is under any obligation to disclose to Buyer any information the
disclosure of which (i) is restricted by applicable Law or any obligations to
any third party or (ii) is subject to attorney-client privilege. Buyer and its
representatives will not have access to employment records of individual
employees of the Company or its Subsidiary prior to the Closing except on such
terms as may be agreed by the Company and Buyer in order to protect
confidential information and ensure compliance with all applicable Laws and
the Company\'s policies. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.2(a)
will be conducted in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiary, and no such
investigation will affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of
any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.



(b) Solely to the extent in Seller\'s possession prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall provide Buyer promptly following finalization thereof, as
applicable (i) for each completed calendar month between the date hereof and
the Closing, the unaudited consolidated monthly and/or quarterly balance
sheets and statements of operations, cash flows and changes in equity of the
Company and its Subsidiary and (ii) the auditor\'s report of the consolidated
balance sheets and statements of operations, cash flows and changes in equity
of the Company and its Subsidiary for the 12-month period ended December 31,
2012. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that such financial statements or
auditor\'s report may not be finalized prior to Closing and the obligation of
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
conditioned upon its receipt of any such financial statements or auditor\'s
report.



(c) Following the Closing, Buyer will, and will cause the Company to, give
Seller and its representatives reasonable access during the Company\'s regular
business hours upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable
circumstances to books, records and personnel of the Company in order to
permit them to take any action contemplated to be taken by them hereunder or
as otherwise may be necessary to exercise any of their rights or obligations
hereunder, including in connection with any Actions under Article VIII.



5.3 Reasonable Efforts. Without limiting any covenant contained in this
Article V, Buyer and Seller will, and will each cause their respective
Subsidiaries to (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to assemble, prepare
and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as
may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all
Authorizations of any Governmental Authority required to be obtained in
connection with the Transactions, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all material Authorizations of third parties that any of Buyer, Seller
or their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate
the Transactions, and (c) take such other action as may reasonably be
necessary or as another party hereto may reasonably request to satisfy the
conditions of Article VI or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event will Seller, the Company or its Subsidiary be obligated
to bear any material expense or pay any material fee or grant any material
concession in connection with obtaining any Authorizations required in order
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



5.4 Antitrust Approvals. (a) Each of Buyer and Seller will (i) make or cause
to be made all filings required of it or its Affiliates under the Antitrust
Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any
event, within ten Business Days from the date of this Agreement, (ii) comply
at the earliest practicable date with any request under the Antitrust Laws for
additional information, documents or other materials received by it or its
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or the
Transactions, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with
any such filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law with respect to
any such filing or the Transactions. Each of Buyer and Seller will use its
reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other all information required for
any application or other filing required to be made pursuant to any applicable
Law in connection with the Transactions and promptly inform the other of any
oral communication with, and, subject to applicable Law, provide copies of
written communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such
filings or the Transactions. No party hereto will independently participate in
any scheduled meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other party hereto, to the extent reasonably practicable, prior notice of the
meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting.



(b) Without limiting the generality or effect of Section 5.2(a) or 5.3, each
of Buyer and Seller will use its respective reasonable best efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law and take such action as
may be required to cause the expiration of the waiting periods under the
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement; provided, however, in no event shall either
Buyer or Seller seek early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. In connection therewith, if
any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Transactions (or any portion thereof) as in violation of any Antitrust Law,
each of Buyer and Seller will cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Governmental Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions unless Buyer and Seller mutually agree that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller will take promptly any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and 

every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority, so as to enable the parties hereto to close the
Transactions as promptly as possible, including, in the case of Buyer,
agreeing to, and thereafter using its best efforts to cause to be implemented
in accordance with their terms, such divestiture, hold-separate or other
orders or remedies as any Governmental Authority may require to permit the
Transactions to be consummated as promptly as possible and in any event prior
to the Termination Date.



(c) Buyer will be solely responsible for and pay all filing fees payable to
Governmental Authorities under any Antitrust Law.



5.5 Indemnification and Insurance. (a) From and after the Closing Date, the
Buyer will cause the Company and its Subsidiary to maintain in effect all
rights of any individual who, on or prior to the Closing Date was a director
or officer of the Company or its Subsidiary to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date as provided in (i) the respective certificate of incorporation or similar
organizational documents of the applicable Company or its applicable
Subsidiary and (ii) any director and/or officer indemnification agreement set
forth on Schedule 3.14 hereto, in each case to survive the Closing Date and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.



(b) The provisions of this Section 5.5 will survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified Person hereunder and its successors and representatives. The
rights of the indemnified Persons under this Section 5.5 will be in addition
to any rights such Persons may have under the organizational or
indemnification documents of Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiary, by contract
or by law.



(c) The obligations under this Section 5.5 will not be terminated or modified
by Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiary in a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnified Person to whom this Section 5.5 applies without the consent of the
affected indemnified Person. In the event that Buyer, the Company or its
Subsidiary or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Persons or (ii) transfers 50% or more of its
properties or assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision
will be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5.



5.6 Employment Matters. (a) Until December 1, 2013, Buyer will cause the
Company to continue to provide the active employees of the Company or its
Subsidiary with salary, wages, bonus opportunities, commission opportunities,
if applicable, and benefits (excluding in all cases, transaction bonuses and
equity-based compensation and benefits), which in the aggregate are at least
substantially equivalent to the salary, wages, bonus opportunities, commission
opportunities, if applicable, and benefits (with respect to benefits, as
provided under the Employee Plans as set forth on, and as otherwise described
in, Schedule 3.14(a)) (excluding in all cases, transaction bonuses and equity-
based compensation and benefits) provided prior to the Closing Date by the
Company or its Subsidiary, taken as a whole. This Section 5.6 will not limit
the obligation of the Company or its Subsidiary or any successor or assign to
maintain any Employee Plan that, pursuant to an existing Contract, must be
maintained for a period longer than one year. No provision of this Agreement
will be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any employee of
the Company or its Subsidiary, and this Agreement will not be construed so as
to prohibit the Company or its Subsidiary from having the right to terminate
the employment of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiary. 



(b) Each employee and former employee of the Company or its Subsidiary will be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiary
(and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date under any
employee benefit plan of Buyer and its Subsidiaries providing benefits similar
to those provided under an Employee Plan to the same extent as such employee
or former employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such
service under such Employee Plan; provided, that the foregoing will not apply
to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or with respect to
benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans. With respect to the
applicable plan year in which Buyer ceases to maintain any particular Employee
Plan, each employee will be given credit for amounts paid under such Employee
Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the parallel plan, program or arrangement of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries.



(c) No provision of this Section 5.6 (i) creates any third-party beneficiary
or other rights for any employee of the Company or its Subsidiary (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof), (ii) constitutes an employment
agreement or an amendment to or adoption of any employee benefit plan of or by
any member of Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiary, or (iii) will alter or
limit the ability of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them in accordance with the terms of such plan, program
agreement or arrangement and applicable Law.



(d) Upon Buyer\'s written request, made at least five business days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate the 2GIG Technologies, Inc.
401(k) Plan no later than immediately prior to the Closing.



(e) For a period of one year after the Closing Date, Seller shall make
available to Buyer or the Company the services of Todd Santiago (so long as he
continues to be employed by Vivint, Inc. or one of its Affiliates) as
reasonably requested by Buyer or the Company to facilitate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided that Buyer shall reimburse Todd
Santiago and Seller for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
providing such services (it being understood, for avoidance of doubt, that
Seller or its Affiliates shall not be entitled to reimbursement for any
portion of Todd Santiago\'s compensation or benefits).



5.7 Public Announcements. The initial press release announcing this Agreement
will be in substantially the form previously agreed to by representatives of
the parties. Thereafter, no party will issue any press release or otherwise
make any similar public announcement with respect to the Transactions, without
the prior written consent of Buyer and Seller, except to the extent required
by Law or Governmental Authority, in which case it will, if practicable in the
circumstances, use its reasonable efforts to consult with the other party with
respect to the timing and content thereof.



5.8 Termination of Certain Arrangements. Effective immediately prior to the
Closing, Seller will take such action as is required to cause the Contracts
set forth in Schedule 5.8 to be terminated in their entirety, and will deliver
to Buyer evidence of such termination in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer.



5.9 Intercompany Balances. Seller shall take such action as is necessary prior
to or concurrently with the Closing to cause all intercompany balances owed by
the Company or its Subsidiary to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Company and its Subsidiary) to be contributed to the capital of the
Company.



5.10 No Shop. From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Seller
will not, and will direct the Company and its directors, officers, agents,
employees and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly (a)
discuss, negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, assist, recommend, propose
or enter into, whether as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or
acquired corporation or otherwise, any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any material
amount of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or
any capital stock or other ownership interest in the Company or its
Subsidiary, other than the Sale and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (an "Acquisition Transaction"), (b) facilitate or encourage,
solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or
offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction, (c) furnish or cause to be
furnished to any Person, any information concerning the business, operations,
properties or assets of the Company in connection with an Acquisition
Transaction, or (d) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other
Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Promptly following the date hereof,
Seller will exercise any contractual rights available to it to cause each
Person (other than Buyer and its representatives) who received non-public or
confidential information of the Company or its Subsidiary in connection with
any possible Acquisition Transaction to cause such Persons to promptly return
to Seller or the Company or destroy such information.



5.11 Non-Solicitation.



(a) For a period of 2 years from and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall
not, and shall cause its directors, officers, employees and Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly cause, solicit (other than any general solicitation
not specifically directed at the Company or its Subsidiary), induce or
encourage any employees of the Company or its Subsidiary to leave such
employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual.



(b) For a period of 2 years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not,
and shall cause its directors, officers, employees and Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly cause, solicit (other than any general solicitation not
specifically directed at the Seller or its Subsidiaries), induce or encourage
any employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries to leave such employment or hire,
employ or otherwise engage any such individual.



5.12 Disclosure Schedule. In the preparation of Disclosure Schedules prior to
the date hereof, Seller has included in the Disclosure Schedule items that may
not be material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or
any references to dollar amounts, will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment
or representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. Information disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule delivered by
Seller will qualify any representation and warranty herein to the extent that
the relevance or applicability of the information disclosed with respect to
the representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on its face,
notwithstanding the absence of a reference or cross-reference to such
representation and warranty on any such Disclosure Schedule or the absence of
a reference or cross-reference to such Disclosure Schedule in such
representation and warranty. Descriptions of terms or 

documents summarized in the Disclosure Schedule will be qualified in their
entirety by the documents themselves; provided that such documents, including
all amendments, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto, have been
made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof.



5.13 Tax Matters.



(a) From and after the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall provide the
other party with such information and records and make such of its officers,
directors, employees and agents available as may reasonably be requested by
such other party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any
audit or other proceeding that relates to the Company or its Subsidiary.
Promptly following Seller\'s written request, Buyer shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiary to prepare and provide to Seller a package of tax
information materials requested by Seller, including schedules and work papers
(the "Tax Package") required by Seller to enable it or its direct or indirect
parent to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed
by it pursuant to Section 5.13(c)(i). The Tax Package shall be completed in
accordance with past practice, including past practice as to providing such
information and as to the method of computation of separate taxable income or
other relevant measure of the Company and its Subsidiary, and shall be
delivered to Seller within 60 days after the Closing Date.



(b) Transactions occurring or actions taken on the Closing Date but after the
Closing outside the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this
Agreement by, or with respect to, the Company or its Subsidiary, shall be
deemed subject to the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (and under any comparable or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Laws) and shall for purposes of this Agreement be
treated (and consistently reported by the parties) as occurring in a taxable
period commencing after the Closing Date.



(c) Tax Returns.



(i) Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due (A) all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiary
on or before the Closing Date (after taking into account applicable
extensions) and (B) any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate Tax
Return joined by the Company or its Subsidiary that are due after the Closing
Date if such Tax Return includes Seller or any Affiliate of Seller which is
not being acquired by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. In each case, Seller
shall remit any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with past practice unless otherwise required
by applicable Law. Seller shall deliver any Tax Return described in Section
5.13(c)(i)(A), and the pro forma portion of any Tax Return described in
Section 5.13(c)(i)(B) to the extent it pertains to the Company or its
Subsidiary to Buyer at least 30 days before it is due, Buyer shall have the
right to review and comment on such Tax Returns, and Seller shall not file
such Tax Returns (or subject to Section 5.1(b)(ix), unless required by
applicable Law, amend such Tax Returns to the extent that such amendment
relates to the Company or its Subsidiary and would increase the Taxes of the
Company or its Subsidiary for a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date) without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that
Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any objection with respect to such Tax
Return at 

least 10 days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved
pursuant to Section 5.13(f), which resolution shall be binding on the parties.



(ii) Buyer shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns of the
Company or its Subsidiary that are not described in Section 5.13(c)(i). With

accordance with past practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law, (B)
Buyer shall deliver any such Tax Return to Seller at least 30 days before it
is due, (C) Seller shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax
Return, (D) such Tax Return shall not be filed without the prior written
consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, and (E) in the event that Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any
objection with respect to such Tax Return at least 10 days prior to the due
date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 5.13(f),
which resolution shall be binding on the parties. Seller shall remit to Buyer
the Taxes for which it is liable pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii) but which are
payable with Tax Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to this Section
5.13(c)(ii) within 10 days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Returns.



(iii) Unless required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not amend any Tax Returns
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiary for any taxable period beginning
on or prior to the Closing Date if Seller might be liable for additional Taxes
on such amended Tax Return under Section 8.1(a)(iii) without the prior written
consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.



(d) Contest Provisions.



(i) Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon receipt
of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits or assessments with respect to Taxes for which Seller may be required
to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(a) (a "Tax Claim"); provided, that
failure to comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer\'s right to
indemnification hereunder unless such failure materially prejudices the rights
of Seller.



(ii) Seller shall have the right to represent the Company and its Subsidiary
with respect to any Tax Claim; provided, that (A) Seller shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed and consult in good faith with Buyer and its tax advisors
with respect to any issue relating to such Tax Claims; (B) Seller shall

materials received from any Governmental Authority relating to such Tax Claim
and shall otherwise keep Buyer and its tax advisors advised of significant

with a copy of any written submission to a Governmental Authority prior to the
submission thereof and shall give serious and good faith consideration to any
comments or suggested revisions that Buyer or its tax advisors may have with
respect thereto; and (D) there shall be no settlement of any such Tax Claim
(and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall consent to any such
settlement) without the consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.



(e) Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements. Any tax sharing, tax indemnity
or tax allocation agreement between the Company or its Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date, and the Company and its Subsidiary shall
not be obligated to make any payments pursuant to any such agreement
thereafter.



(f) Disputes. Any dispute as to any matter covered by this Section 5.13 shall
be resolved by the Accounting Firm, and any responsibility for Taxes pursuant
to this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the final
determination of the Accounting Firm (whether or not the relevant Tax Return
is amended in accordance with the last sentence of this Section 5.13(f)). The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and
Buyer. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to
the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner
which the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct,
without prejudice to the rights of the parties to pursue such dispute and each
party shall use its reasonable efforts to amend the Tax Return in accordance
with the final determination of the Accounting Firm.

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;



(b) by either Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if the
Closing has not occurred on or before June 14, 2013 (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that the 

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) will not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
caused, or resulted in, the failure of the Transactions to be consummated on
or before such date;



(c) by either Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if the
consummation of the Transactions (or any portion thereof) is enjoined,

provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(c) will not be available to any party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement has caused, or resulted in, the issuance of such
non-appealable Governmental Order; or



(d) by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, if there is any
material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant on the part of
Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, set forth in this
Agreement, such that the conditions specified in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) (in
the case of a termination by Buyer) or Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) (in the case
of a termination by Seller) would not be satisfied at the Closing and, in
either such case, such breach cannot be cured by the Termination Date, or if
capable of being cured, is not cured within 30 days after written notice of
such breach is given by the applicable party (or, if earlier, the Termination
Date); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.1(d) will not be available to any party who is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants under
this Agreement.



7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 7.1, this Agreement will forthwith become void and
have no effect, and no party hereto, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or any of the officers or directors of any of the foregoing,
will have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that
the Confidentiality Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, and this Section 7.2 and Article X will each
survive any termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or damages
incurred or suffered by the other party, to the extent such liabilities or
damages were the willful and material breach by such party of any of its
covenants or other obligations set forth in this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach
that is a consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the
knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking of such act would, or would
be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.



VIII. INDEMNIFICATION



8.1 Indemnification by Seller. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Article VIII, Seller will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiary), officers, directors, managers, stockholders, employees and
assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or
reimburse Buyer Indemnitees for, any and all damages, losses, liabilities and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable expert
witness fees and reasonable attorneys\' fees (collectively,
"LossesLosses8.1(a)"), of Buyer Indemnitees in connection with, resulting from
or arising out of:



(i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement (A) on and as of the Closing Date with the same
effect as though made on and as of the Closing Date (other than any such
representation or warranty that speaks of a specific date or time other than
the Closing Date) or (B) on and as of the date or time when made, in the case
of any representation or warranty that speaks as of a specific date or time
other than the Closing Date;



(ii) any breach by Seller of any covenant contained in this Agreement or of
any Post-Closing Covenant of Seller; or



(iii) any Seller Taxes of the Company, except to the extent included in the
calculation of Net Working Capital or the liability for such Seller Taxes is
reduced by reason of a utilization of a net operating loss of the Company
which is in existence as of the Closing Date, and reduced by the amount of all
cash refunds of Seller Taxes of the Company actually received by the Company
after the Closing Date and all overpayments in respect of Seller Taxes of the
Company actually reducing cash Taxes payable of the Company after the Closing
Date (other than any refunds, overpayments or reductions of Seller Taxes (x)
arising from the carryback of losses, credits or other Tax attributes from a
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or (y)
reflected as an asset in the calculation of Net Working Capital).



(iv) any claim arising out of or resulting from the facts described in Item 1
of Schedule 3.18(b)(1) (such item, the "Wireless Mesh License Request")
related solely to products shipped by the Company or its Subsidiary prior to
Closing (the "Pre-Closing Products"), including any royalties or license fees
payable to MPEG LA, SIPCO, LLC and IntusIQ (formerly known as IPCO, LLC)
(collectively, "SIPCO") in connection with such products, provided that any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.1(a)(iv) shall not exceed, for each
unit of Pre-Closing Product, the lowest per-unit royalty, license fee or other
payment payable by Buyer and its Affiliates to SIPCO for products shipped
after the Closing.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will not be required to indemnify Buyer
Indemnitees (A) with respect to any individual matter or series of related
matters described in Section 8.1(a)(i) (other than Fundamental Representations
and the representations and warranties in Section 3.16 (Taxes)) unless the
aggregate amount of Losses with respect thereto exceeds $25,000 or (B) with
respect to matters described in Section 8.1(a)(i) (other than Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties in Section 3.16
(Taxes)) unless, and then only to the extent that, the aggregate amount of all
Losses (not including Losses that are excluded under clause (A) above)
thereunder exceeds $500,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, in no event shall Seller\'s aggregate liability for all Losses
under this Agreement taken as a whole exceed $13,000,000 (the "Cap") (other
than any claims for indemnification for any Consolidated Return Tax
Liability).

(b) Each of the representations and warranties of Seller contained herein will
survive the Closing until the Survival Date (other than the representations
and warranties of Seller contained in Section 3.16 (Taxes), which will survive
the Closing until the Tax Survival Date). The covenants in Section 5.1, 5.8,
5.9, 5.14 and 5.15 will survive the Closing until the Survival Date and the
covenants contained in Section 5.13 will survive the Closing until the Tax
Survival Date. Any covenant or agreement contained in this 

Agreement that, by its terms, provides for performance following the Closing
("Post-Closing Covenants") will survive and continue in full force and effect
until such covenant is performed or observed in accordance with its terms. All
other covenants contained in this Agreement will not survive the Closing.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event will any Buyer
Indemnitee be entitled to make any claim for indemnification under this
Agreement after the Survival Date or the Tax Survival Date, as applicable;
provided that nothing herein will limit specific performance remedies with
respect to the Post-Closing Covenants.



8.2 Indemnification Procedures. (a) Notice and Opportunity to Defend Claims.
If an event occurs that a Person entitled to indemnification with respect
thereto under this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") asserts is an
indemnifiable event pursuant to Section 8.1, the Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification will notify the Buyer or Seller, as applicable (in such case,
the "Indemnifying Party") promptly, but no later than 30 days, after such
Indemnified Party receives written notice, in the case of a third-party claim,
or otherwise becomes aware, in the case of a direct claim, of any such claim,
event or matter as to which indemnity may be sought; provided, however, that
the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided in this
Section 8.2(a) will not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations
under Section 8.1, except to the extent that such failure materially
prejudices the rights of any such Indemnifying Party. Any notice of a claim,
event or matter as to which indemnity may be sought will include a reasonably
detailed description of such claim, event or matter, the basis of the claim
for indemnification, copies of material documentation reasonably accessible to
or in the possession of the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party
believes supports such claim for indemnification and a good faith estimate, to
the extent practicable, of the amount of Losses incurred or which reasonably
could be expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such claim.



(b) Third-Party Claims. In the case of any claim asserted by a third party
against an Indemnified Party (other than any Tax Claim, which shall be
governed by Section 5.13(d) in lieu of the entirety of this Section 8.2(b)),
the Indemnified Party will give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of
the third-party claim in accordance with Section 8.2(a), and the Indemnified
Party will permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying
Party) to assume (upon acknowledging that the applicable Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification with respect to such claim, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article VIII) the defense of any third-party
claim or any litigation with a third party resulting therefrom; provided,
however, that (i) counsel for the Indemnifying Party who conducts the defense
of such claim or litigation will be subject to the approval of the Indemnified
Party (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and (ii) the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at
such Indemnified Party\'s expense. Except with the prior consent of the
Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or
litigation, will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
that (i) provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) involves aggregate monetary
payments in excess of the Cap or (iii) that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates of a general release from all liability
with respect to such claim or litigation. If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense of any matter as above provided, the Indemnified Party will
have the right to defend such matter and to settle such matter; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party may not settle such claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or 

delayed). In any event, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any third-party claim or litigation
subject to this Article VIII and will each provide the other reasonable access
to its records in order to facilitate the defense and settlement of such
matter. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith pursuant to a mutually
agreed joint defense agreement in the defense of any action involving the
Wireless Mesh License Request. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller\'s right to
assume the defense of the Wireless Mesh License Request pursuant to this
Section 8.2(b) shall be limited to the portion of such claim for which Seller
has an indemnification obligation hereunder, and nothing in this Agreement
shall in any way limit the right of Buyer and its Subsidiaries to assume and
control the defense of any portion of the Wireless Mesh License Request for
which Seller does not have any indemnification obligation hereunder.



8.3 Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, the indemnification provided for
in this Article VIII will be the sole and exclusive remedy available to any
Buyer Indemnitee against another party for any claims under or based upon this
Agreement or the Transactions except for actual fraud. Without limiting the
foregoing, in no event will Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to
offset any amounts owed to it pursuant to this Article VIII against any
amounts owed by Buyer, any Buyer Indemnitee, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to any Contract.



8.4 Additional Limitations and Qualifications on Indemnification; Subrogation.
(a) No Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII for (i) any punitive damages or (ii) any lost profits or
consequential, special or indirect damages, except, in the case of (ii), to
the extent such lost profits or damages are (x) not based on any special
circumstances of the Indemnified Party and (y) the natural, probable and
reasonably foreseeable result of the event that gave rise thereto or the
matter for which indemnification is sought hereunder; provided, however, that
if an Indemnified Person is held liable to a third party based on any final
Governmental Order for any such damages and the applicable Indemnifying Party
is obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Person for the matter that gave
rise to such damages, then such Indemnifying Party will be liable for, and
obligated to reimburse such Indemnified Party for, such damages.



(b) Each of the Buyer Indemnitees will use its reasonable best efforts to
mitigate all Losses (other than Losses with respect to Taxes) for which such
Indemnified Parties are entitled or may be entitled to indemnification
hereunder.



(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Buyer
Indemnitee will be indemnified for any Loss to the extent that such Loss was
reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital or Indebtedness, as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3.



(d) Any indemnifiable Loss hereunder will be calculated net of any insurance
recoveries or recoveries from third parties pursuant to indemnification or
otherwise, in each case actually received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
costs of recovering such amount. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment
on any claim pursuant to Section 8.1, the Indemnifying Party will be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified
Party with respect to such claim. The parties hereto will execute, upon
request, all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
above described subrogation rights.



(e) Any indemnifiable Loss hereunder will be calculated net of any Tax savings
realized by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates in the form of a
cash refund or reduction in cash Taxes payable in the year in which the
indemnity payment is to be made or in a prior year and arising in connection
with the accrual, incurrence of payment of any such Loss.



8.5 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payment made pursuant to this Article
VIII will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, as the case may
be, for all Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein

legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants.



10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to agreements
executed and performed entirely within such state, without regard to the
conflict of laws principles that would result in the application of any Law
other than the Law of the State of Delaware.



10.7 Captions; Counterparts. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and will not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an
original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument.



10.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement) and the letter agreement, dated June 4, 2012, by
and between Buyer, and on behalf of the Company, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto relating to the Transactions and supersede any other
agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered into
by or among any of the parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries
relating to the Transactions. The parties negotiated this Agreement with the
assistance of professional advisors and intend that the Agreement encompass
the entire relationship among them. As such, the parties hereby confirm that
there are no, and hereby expressly waive and disclaim, extra-contractual
rights or obligations among them, including arising under theories of implied
duties of good faith or fair dealing, actual or constructive fraud or other
theories.



10.9 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed by Buyer and
Seller in the same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this
Agreement.



10.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The parties hereto
further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held
invalid or unenforceable in any respect under applicable Law, they will take
any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this Agreement
valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the
extent necessary, will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid
and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the parties.



10.11 Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. (a) Except as otherwise expressly
set forth herein, all Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement
will be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware). The parties hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any
Action (other than as otherwise expressly set forth herein) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by any party and (b) irrevocably waive, and
agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such
Action, any claim that 

they are not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts,
that the property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any
such Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Action
is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in
or by any of the above-named courts. Each of the parties agrees that mailing
of process or other papers in connection with any action or proceeding in the
manner provided in Section 10.2 or such other manner as may be permitted by
Law will be valid and sufficient service of process. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final and non-appealable judgment in Action so brought
will be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any
jurisdiction within or outside the United States or in any other manner
provided in Law or in equity.



(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 10.11(b).



10.12 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the provisions contained in this Agreement were not
performed (including failing to take such actions as are required hereunder to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with their specified terms or were
otherwise breached. It is therefore acknowledged and agreed that the parties
will be entitled to specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement). The parties agree that they will not oppose the
granting of specific performance on the basis that other parties have an
adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. In the event a party
seeks specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such party,
as applicable, will not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such Governmental Order. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Buyer be obligated to both specifically perform
its obligations to consummate the Transactions and to pay monetary damages for
any failure to consummate the Transactions pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.



10.13 Seller Professional Advisors. Each party hereto hereby acknowledges, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that each of the Seller
Professional Advisors may advise and represent Seller, the Company and their
Affiliates in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and that,
following consummation of the transactions, each of the Seller Professional
Advisors may advise and represent Seller or its Affiliates, if such Persons so
request, in connection with any Action or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and each party hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest
arising therefrom, and each party and their respective Boards of Directors (or
committees thereof) will cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive
any conflict of interest arising from any such representation. Buyer, for
itself, and the Company and for their respective successors and assigns,
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the
Company, Seller and the Seller Professional Advisors that are legal counsel
that were made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and closing under, or any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement which, immediately prior to the Closing, would
be deemed to be privileged communications of the Company and Seller and their
legal counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to Buyer or the Company
in connection with any process relating to a dispute arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise, will continue after the Closing
to be privileged communications between such Persons and such legal counsel,
and none of Buyer, the Company or any Person acting or purporting to act on
behalf of or through Buyer or the Company will seek to obtain the same by any
process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such communications
belongs to Buyer or the Company.
