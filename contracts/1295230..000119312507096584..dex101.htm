ARTICLE III

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; 

SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company
or any stockholder of the Company (each such stockholder, a
"Company Stockholder"):

(a) Each share of common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the
"Common Stock" and each such share of Common Stock, a "Share", and
collectively, the "Shares"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive and become exchangeable for sixty-seven
dollars and fifty cents ($67.50) in cash, without interest thereon (the
"Merger Consideration"), as provided in Section 3.2 hereof.



 

8 (b) Each Share issued and outstanding and owned by the Parent, the Merger Sub
or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Parent and each Share owned by
the Company or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in each case not
held on behalf of third parties (collectively, the "Excluded Shares"),
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no cash, securities or other consideration shall be payable in
respect thereof.

(c) Each share of common stock of the Merger Sub, par value $.01 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares
or any similar event, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be correspondingly adjusted to the
extent appropriate to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares
or similar event.

3.2 _Surrender of Stock Certificates and Payment_.

(a) Promptly following the Effective Time, the Parent shall enter into an
agreement with a bank or trust company of recognized standing that may be
designated by the Parent and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"Paying Agent"). Immediately following the Effective Time, the Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the Company Stockholders (other than with respect to the Excluded
Shares and the Dissenting Shares), the amount of cash payable pursuant to
Section 3.1 as of the Effective Time in respect of the Shares (other than the
Excluded Shares and the Dissenting Shares) (such cash, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred
to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall make the cash payments
provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a form satisfactory
to the Parent and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
certificates representing Shares (the "Certificates") or transfer of
uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares") to the Paying Agent) for
use in exchanging the Shares and the Uncertificated Shares for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Shares and Uncertificated Shares.
Upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, or (ii) receipt of  



 

9  an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or any other evidence that the
Paying Agent may reasonably request ) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Shares or Uncertificated Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject
to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (A)(x) the number
of Shares represented by a Certificate or (y) the number of Uncertificated
Shares and (B) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or the
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the holder of record of such Shares, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or, in the case of Uncertificated
Shares, such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any and all
Taxes required as a result of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or the Uncertificated Shares or establish
by evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that any such Taxes have been
paid or are not payable. Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by
this Section 3.2, each Certificate and Uncertificated Share (other than
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing the Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares) shall represent at all times after the Effective Time
solely the right to receive, upon such surrender or transfer, in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
represented thereby.

(d) All cash paid upon surrender of the Certificates or the transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates or the Uncertificated
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the Company Stockholders shall
cease to have any rights with respect to Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
presented to the Paying Agent or the Parent for any reason shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in, this Article III.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the Company
Stockholders for a period of six months after the Effective Time shall
be redelivered to the Parent, and any Company Stockholders who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the
Parent for the cash to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.1. Any
portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by the Company Stockholders
as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, neither the Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Company Stockholder or other
Person for cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



 

10 3.3 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
or Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate and the payment of any fee charged
by the Paying Agent for such service, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount of cash to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1 (subject to any applicable
withholding Taxes).

3.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by Company Stockholders who have demanded and perfected appraisal rights for
such Shares in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by them in accordance with
the DGCL, unless and until such Company Stockholders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under the DGCL.
All Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such
Shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash, without any interest thereon, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1 (subject to any
applicable withholding Taxes), upon the surrender or transfer, in the manner
provided in Section 3.2, of the corresponding Certificate or Uncertificated
Share.

(b) The Company shall give the Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Parent, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

3.5 _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares_.

(a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required so that (i)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option
shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full, (ii) with respect to
each such Company Stock Option that remains outstanding and unexercised as of
the Effective Time, each such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled as of
the Effective Time in exchange for the right of the holder thereof to receive
from the Parent or Surviving Corporation, in accordance with this Section 3.5,
a lump sum cash payment (without interest) in the amount of the consideration
described below, if any, with respect to each  



 

11  such Company Stock Option and shall no longer represent, or represent the
right to purchase, Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Company,
the Merger Sub, the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person or
to purchase any other securities or assets, and (iii) as of the Effective
Time, the Company Stock Plans shall be terminated. At the Effective Time,
except as otherwise set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule, each
Company Stock Option issued by the Company that is outstanding and remains
unexercised at that time will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the amount, if any, by which the
Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company
Stock Option, _multiplied by_ (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option in full (to the extent it
has not already been exercised) (with the aggregate amount of such payment
rounded to the nearest cent). After the Effective Time, any such cancelled
Company Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder
thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment described in the
preceding sentence. As of the Effective Time, any Company Stock Option with an
exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled without consideration and be of no further force and effect. The
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable best efforts
to provide the lump sum cash payments required pursuant to this Section 3.5(a)
within five Business Days following the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued,
vested or unvested, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the
value of Shares, and each vested or unvested award of any kind consisting of
Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for
issuance under the Company Stock Plans, including restricted stock
units under the Company Stock Plans ("Company RSUs"), other than Company
Stock Options (the "Company Awards"), shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder thereof to receive from the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, a lump sum amount in cash (without interest) equal to (x) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_multiplied by_  (y) the Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award
provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceed a specified
reference price, the amount, if any, by which the value of the Merger
Consideration exceeds such reference price). The Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall use their reasonable best efforts to provide the lump sum
cash payments required pursuant to this Section 3.5(b) within five Business
Days following the Effective Time.

(c) The Company will take all necessary actions to provide that, (i) the
Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be suspended and no new offering
periods will be commenced subsequent to the date hereof and that no
contributions will be accepted by the Company Stock Purchase Plan on or after
the date hereof, except payroll deductions withheld with respect to the April
30, 2007 payroll date, (ii) with respect to persons participating in the
Company Stock Purchase Plan on the date hereof (and who have not withdrawn
from or otherwise ceased participation in the Company Stock Purchase Plan
prior to such date), accumulated contributions as of the date hereof
(including payroll deductions withheld with respect to the April 30, 2007
payroll date) will be applied on  



 

12  such date to the purchase of Common Stock in accordance with the Company
Stock Purchase Plans terms, (iii) following the purchase of Common
Stock contemplated by Section 3.5(c)(ii), any remaining balances in the
accounts of the participants in the Company Stock Purchase Plan are returned
in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan, and (iv)
there are no outstanding rights of participants under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan following the termination thereof at the Effective Time. Common
Stock acquired pursuant to this Section 3.5(c) shall be subject to all
provisions hereof applicable to Common Stock, including, without limitation,
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof. Upon or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all action necessary to provide that the Company Stock Purchase
Plan shall be terminated as of the Effective Time and that no Person will
have any further right to purchase Common Stock under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan.

3.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Parent and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company
Stockholder, any holder of a Company Stock Option, any holder of a Company
Award or any participant in the Company Stock Purchase Plan such amounts, if
any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Stock Option, Company Award or any participant in the Company Stock
Purchase Plan, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

Subsidiaries of the Company and sets forth with respect to each such
Subsidiary the jurisdiction of formation, the authorized and outstanding

Company is a party to any Contract obligating the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company, as applicable, directly or indirectly, to issue additional

to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its securities. There are

15  Agreement. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor

lapse of restrictions that is contingent upon the occurrence of a subsequent
event) in favor of any holder of Company Stock Options or Company Awards or
(ii) any additional benefits for any holder of Company Stock Options or

the Merger prior thereto, and all such rights of notice will terminate at or

any matter on which stockholders of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company may vote.

will not, directly or indirectly, (i) violate the provisions of the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries Charter Documents, (ii) violate or conflict with,
or constitute a default, an event of default or an event creating rights of
acceleration, termination, cancellation, imposition of additional obligations
or loss of rights, or require a consent to assignment, under any Contract (A)

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary or (C) by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets is
bound, (iii) assuming all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.5 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the SEC (including those required pursuant to the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) since January 1, 2005 (collectively, and in each case including all
exhibits and schedules thereto and documents included by reference therein to
other Company SEC Reports, the "Company SEC Reports"). As of the respective
dates they were filed (and if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing), (i) each Company SEC
Report complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and (ii) none of the Company SEC Reports contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form, report or other
document with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the "Company
Financial Statements") was prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) and each presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-
end adjustments that would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or
in the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole). The most recent audited balance sheet of the Company contained in the
Company SEC Reports as of December 31, 2006 is hereinafter referred to as the
"Company Balance Sheet" and the date thereof is hereinafter referred to as
the "Company Balance Sheet Date." The books and records of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with applicable legal and accounting requirements, and
the Company Financial Statements are consistent in all material respects with
such books and records.



 

18 (c) The Company has established and maintained disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act).
Such disclosure controls and procedures are sufficient to ensure that all
material information that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(d) The Company has established and maintained internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the
Exchange Act). Such internal controls over financial reporting provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no significant deficiencies
or material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys internal
controls that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data. There is no fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls.

4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no
liabilities, obligations or commitments of any nature whatsoever, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, accrued or unaccrued,
matured or unmatured or otherwise that are required to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in
accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto ("Liabilities"), except (a) those
that are reflected or reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet, (b) those
that have been incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practice since the Company Balance Sheet Date and that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material in amount and (c) those that would
not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule and except as would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment
to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract or arrangement (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined
in Item 303(a)(iv) of Regulation S-K)).

any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) no deficiency with respect to Taxes has been
proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Governmental Entity, and all information reporting, backup withholding and
record maintenance requirements have been complied with; and (vi) each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has adequately provided for, in its books of
account and related records, all Liability for unpaid Taxes, including current

(e) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any material property or other materials
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for Permitted Liens.

(f) The statute of limitations for the assessment of income Taxes has expired
for all periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2002. Except as set forth
in the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return, nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
made (or had made on its behalf) any requests for such extensions. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived (or is subject to a waiver of)
any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or has agreed to (or
is subject to) any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency.



 

20 (g) The Company has made available to the Parent correct and complete copies
of all federal income Tax Returns, examination reports, and statements of

that constitutes a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b).

4.8 _Compliance with Law_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
complied with each, and is not in violation of any, applicable Law to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its business, operations,
assets or properties are or have been subject, except for any such violations
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No event has occurred and no
circumstances exist that (with or without the passage of time or the giving of
notice) may result in a violation of, conflict with or failure on the part of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with, any Law, except for
any such violations, conflicts or failures to comply that would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
notice regarding any such violation of, conflict with, or failure to comply
with, any Law.

4.9 _Authorizations_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns, holds or
lawfully uses in the operation of its business all Authorizations that are
necessary for it to conduct its business as currently conducted or for the
ownership and use of the assets owned or used by the Company or such
Subsidiary in the conduct of its business free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens), except where the failure to own, hold, possess or
lawfully use any such Authorizations would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all such Authorizations are
valid and in full force and effect and none of such Authorizations will be
terminated or impaired or become terminable as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material  



 

21  Adverse Effect, no event has occurred and no circumstances exist that (with
or without the passage of time or the giving of notice) may result in a

Authorization.

deductibility of any amount payable under any Company Plan will not be limited
by operation of Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code.

(k) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has made any legally binding representations or communications (directly or
indirectly, orally or in writing) with respect to participation, eligibility
for benefits, vesting, benefit accrual coverage or other material terms of any
Company Plan to any employee or beneficiary that would give rise to a
material liability of the Company or any Subsidiary other than: (i) those
which are in accordance with the terms and provisions of each such Company
Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date; (ii) those which are
intended to facilitate compliance with applicable Law (including, without
limitation, Section 409A of the Code); or (iii) those which relate to the
retention program described in the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(l) There are no agreements or legally binding entitlements in place that
would entitle a participant in any "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) to reimbursement for any
additional Tax imposed by Section 409A of the Code.

4.16 _Environmental_.

(a) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is in compliance with (i) all applicable Environmental Laws, and (ii) all
Authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws and all Orders
issued or entered into by a Governmental Entity under any Environmental Law
for the current operation of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries has received any written notice or report in the past three (3)
years regarding any actual or alleged violation of any applicable
Environmental Law or any liabilities arising under applicable Environmental
Laws, in each case concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries.

4.17 _Certain Business Relationships with Affiliates_. Except as disclosed in
the Company SEC Reports, from and after January 1, 2006 and prior to the date
hereof, no event has occurred, and there has been no transaction, or series of
similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is to be a party, that would be required
to be reported pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

4.18  _Insurance_. There are no material claims pending under any insurance
policy, binder of insurance and fidelity bond that covers the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, properties, assets,
directors or employees (the "Policies") as to which coverage has been
questioned, denied or disputed by the insurer or in respect of which the
insurer has reserved its rights. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or affected by any self-insurance arrangement. All
Policies are issued by an insurer that is financially sound and reputable, are
in full force and effect and are enforceable in accordance with their terms
and will continue in full force and effect with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries following the Merger, except for such failures which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Such Policies are sufficient in all
material respects for compliance with all applicable Laws and Contracts to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is
bound. As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received a notice of cancellation of any Policy. There is no existing
default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default under any Policy or entitle any insurer to
terminate or cancel any Policy except for such defaults that would not be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.19 _Books and Records_. The minute books (containing the records of the
meetings, or written consents in lieu of such meetings, of the stockholders,
the board of directors and any committees of the board of directors) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are correct and complete in all material
respects, and have been maintained in accordance with sound business
practices. At the Closing, all of those books and records will be in the
possession of the Company.

4.20 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Each of the financial advisors to the
Company, Merrill Lynch and Co., Inc. and Evercore Partners, has delivered to
the Company an opinion dated as of the date hereof to the effect that, subject
to the various assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration (as defined in the opinion) is fair from a financial point of
view to the Company Stockholders and the Company has provided a true and
correct copy of such opinion to the Parent (or will provide such true and
correct copy reasonably promptly following receipt thereof).



 

29 4.21 _Brokers or Finders_. There is no investment banker, broker, finder,
financial advisor or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of the Company or the Company Stockholders who is
entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than Merrill Lynch and Co., Inc. and
Evercore Partners, the fees and expenses of each of which shall be paid by the
Company in accordance with the Companys agreements with such firm (a complete
and correct copy of which has been provided to the Parent). 

4.22 _Registration as an Exchange_. ISE LLC is registered as a national
securities exchange and as a self-regulatory organization (as registered
under Section 6 and as defined in Section 3(a)(26), respectively, of the
Exchange Act) and has in effect rules (i) in accordance with the provisions of
the Exchange Act for the trading of equity options and equities,
as applicable, and (ii) with respect to all matters for which rules are
required under the Exchange Act pertaining thereto.

4.23  _Takeover Statutes; No Restrictions on the Merger_. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no state "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition"
or similar anti-takeover statute is applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the
Parents representation and warranty set forth in Section 5.6, the Company has
taken all necessary action to render the restrictions on
business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

4.24 _Completeness of Disclosure_. No representation or warranty by the
Company in this Agreement, and no statement made by the Company in
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Exhibits attached hereto or any
certificate furnished or to be furnished to the Parent pursuant hereto,
contains or will at the Closing contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits or will omit to state any material fact necessary to make any
statement herein or therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

4.25 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company in this ARTICLE IV or pursuant to the
certificates to be delivered pursuant to Section 9.2, neither the Company
nor any other Person makes any representation or warranty with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations,
assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent or any of its Affiliates
or representatives of any documentation, forecasts or other information with

officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors
and agents ("Representatives") reasonable access to and the right to inspect,
all of the properties, assets, records, Contracts and other documents related
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (b) permit them to consult with the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and agents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the purpose of making such reasonable investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as the Parent shall desire to make; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access
or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that
doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party or jeopardize the protection of an
attorney-client privilege. 

6.3 _Resignations_. On the Closing Date, subject to the terms of the SEC

6.6 _No Solicitation by the Company_. 

(a) Subject to Section 6.6(b), except with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company agrees that it and its officers
and directors will not, and it will cause its Subsidiaries and its
Subsidiaries officers and directors not to, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective employees, accountants,
counsel, consultants, advisors, agents and Affiliates not to: (i) initiate,
solicit, encourage or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to
or the making or implementation of any Third Party Proposal; (ii) except to
inform Persons of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section
6.6, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any information or data
to, or have any substantive discussions with, any Person relating to a Third
Party Proposal; (iii) otherwise cooperate in or facilitate any effort or
attempt to make, implement or accept a Third Party Proposal; (iv) enter into a
Contract with any Person relating to a Third Party Proposal; or (v) release
any third party from, waive any provision of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party (other than to
the extent necessary to take any actions permitted by Section 6.6(b), 6.6(c)
or 6.6(d)). The Company and its officers and directors will immediately
cease, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries officers and
directors immediately to cease, and will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors, agents and Affiliates immediately to cease, any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to (or reasonably likely to lead to) any Third Party
Proposal. A "Third Party Proposal" means any Contract, proposal or offer
(including any proposal or offer to the stockholders of the Company) with
respect to a proposed or potential Acquisition Transaction. An
"Acquisition Transaction" means: (a) any sale, lease or other disposition,
direct or indirect (and however structured), of any business or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (which business or assets represent 25% or
more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); (b) any tender or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in a third party beneficially owning 25% or more of
any class of securities of the Company; (c) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, joint venture,  



 

36  recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (which Subsidiaries represent
25% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); (d) the issuance, sale or other
disposition, direct or indirect (and however structured), of securities (or
securities or other rights convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable
for, such securities) representing 25% or more of the voting power or capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (which Subsidiaries represent
25% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); or (e) any combination of the
foregoing (other than the Merger). Any breach of this Section 6.6(a) by any
officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 6.6(a) by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.6(a), at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (and in no event after
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval), under circumstances in which the
Company and its Representatives are not in breach of their obligations
pursuant to Section 6.6(a), the Company Board may furnish information to, and
enter into discussions or negotiations with, a Person who has made an
unsolicited written bona fide Third Party Proposal if, and only if, the
Company Board has (i) reasonably concluded that such Third Party Proposal
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
(ii) reasonably concluded, after receiving advice from its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Third Party Proposal, furnishing such
information or entering into such discussions is necessary in order for the
Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) provided written notice to the
Parent of its intent to furnish information or enter into discussions or
negotiations with such Person at least three Business Days prior to taking any
such action and (iv) obtained from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company
(including standstill provisions) than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company Board shall furnish to the Parent all information
provided to the Person who has made such Third Party Proposal to the extent
that such information has not been previously provided to the Parent and shall
keep the Parent reasonably informed as to the status of any discussions
regarding such Third Party Proposal. In addition to the obligations of the
Company set forth in this Section 6.6(a), the Company shall promptly, but in
no event later than 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise the Parent in
writing of any request for information that the Company reasonably believes
could lead to a Third Party Proposal, the terms and conditions of such
request, Third Party Proposal or inquiry (including any subsequent material
amendment or modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of
the Person making the request. The Company shall keep the Parent informed in
all material respects on a reasonably current basis of any change in the
status of, or any modification or amendment to, such Third Party Proposal. A
"Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited written bona fide Third Party
Proposal ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this definition of Superior
Proposal, the term Third Party Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to it
in Section 6.6(a), except that references to "25% or more" in the definition
of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be references to "more than
50%") that the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (having
considered the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and of its outside counsel), to be  



 

37  more favorable to the Company Stockholders, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory, timing and similar aspects of, and conditions to,
such Third Party Proposal, than the terms of the Merger and with any
financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such Third
Party Proposal committed.

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any Committee thereof shall withhold,
withdraw, amend, modify in any manner adverse to the Parent, or change its
recommendation in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval and, in the case
of a tender or exchange offer made directly to the Company Stockholders,
recommend that the Company Stockholders accept such tender or exchange offer
(each, a "Change of Recommendation"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board may make a Change of Recommendation if all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

(i) the Company Stockholders Meeting has not occurred;

(ii) the Company shall have provided at least three Business Days prior
written notice (the "Notice Period") to the Parent stating (A) that it has
concluded in good faith, after receiving the advice of its outside legal
counsel, that effecting a Change of Recommendation is necessary in order for
the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law, (B) in reasonable detail the reason why it
is effecting such Change of Recommendation (including, if the reason for the
Change of Recommendation is a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal) and (C) that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the
manner in which it intends to so; 

(iii) the Parent shall not have made, within the Notice Period, an offer that
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (having considered
the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) enables the
Company Board to withdraw the Change of Recommendation or, if the reason for
the Change of Recommendation is a Superior Proposal, is at least as
favorable to the Company Stockholders as such Superior Proposal (it being
agreed in each case that the Company Board shall convene a meeting to consider
any such offer by the Parent reasonably promptly following the receipt
thereof); and

(iv) the Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in
this Section 6.6 in any material respect.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any
letter of intent, merger, acquisition or similar agreement with respect to
any Third Party Proposal (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement"), other
than a confidentiality agreement subject to the requirements of Section
6.6(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may cause the
Company to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, but only if the Company shall have concurrently with
entering into such Company Acquisition Agreement terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(iv)(B) and all of the following conditions are
satisfied:



 

38 (i) the Company Stockholders Meeting has not occurred;

(ii) the Company shall have provided three Business Days prior written notice
to the Parent stating (A) that it has concluded in good faith, after
receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that such Third Party Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, and (B) that it has concluded in good faith, after
receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, that entering into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal is
advisable in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law;

(iii) the Parent shall not have made, within the three Business Day-period
referred to in clause (ii) above, an offer that the Company Board determines
in its good faith judgment (having considered the advice of its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that is at least as favorable to the
Company Stockholders as such Superior Proposal (it being agreed in each case
that the Company Board shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by
the Parent reasonably promptly following the receipt thereof); and

(iv) the Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in
this Section 6.6 in any material respect.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a

Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) filing this
Agreement and any amendment hereto, together with a description of its terms,
on a Form 8-K with the SEC; _provided_ , that the Company shall not take a
position that effects, or otherwise make any public statement that
constitutes, a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant
to the terms of Section 6.6(c); _provided_ , _however_ , it is understood
and agreed that, for purposes of this Section 6.6, a factually accurate
public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt of a
Third Party Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
and contains a "stop-look-and-listen communication" shall not be deemed a
Change of Recommendation.



 

39 6.7 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. As promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, the Company shall take all action necessary under the DGCL and
its Charter Documents (a) to call, convene and hold a meeting of the Company
Stockholders to vote upon the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company
Stockholders Meeting") and (b) to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval.
The Company Board will recommend that the Company Stockholder Approval be
given and will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Company
Stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the
Company Board effects a Change of Recommendation as provided in Section
6.6(c).

6.8 _Proxy Statement_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to, within 21 days
after the date thereof (assuming full cooperation on the part of the Parent to
supply any information required on its part), prepare and file with the SEC a
proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto,
the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have cleared by the SEC and
thereafter mail to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable the
Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials for the Company Stockholders
Meeting.

(b) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.6(c), (i) the
Company Board shall recommend that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of
the Agreement, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement that the
Company Board has recommended that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of
the Agreement and (iii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall effect any Change of Recommendation.

(c) The Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement will, when filed, comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. At the time the Proxy Statement
or any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
Company Stockholders and at the time the Company Stockholders vote on the
adoption of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended,
if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. If, at any time prior to the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, any event or circumstance relating to the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement is discovered by
the Company, the Company shall reasonably promptly inform the Parent. The
covenant contained in this Section 6.8(c) will not apply to statements or
omissions included in the Proxy Statement based upon information furnished to
the Company in writing by the Parent specifically for use therein.

(d) The Company shall give the Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, each
time before that  



 

40  document (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC, and
reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given to any comments made
by the Parent and its counsel. The Company shall (i) promptly provide the
Parent and its counsel with any comments or other communications, whether
written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement reasonably
promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii)
provide the Parent with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which
reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

6.9 _FIRPTA Certificate_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the
Parent a duly executed certificate stating that the Company is not a "United
States Real Property Holding Corporation" as defined in Section 897 of the
Code in accordance with Treasury Regulation promulgated under Sections 897 and
1445 of the Code (the "FIRPTA Certificate").

ARTICLE VII

COVENANTS OF THE PARENT

7.1 _Benefit Plans_.

(a) During the 18-month period commencing on the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide,
for the benefit of current employees of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries who become employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries ("Transitioned Employees"), while employed by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date: (i) salary that
is at least as favorable as the salary provided to such Transitioned
Employees immediately before the Effective Time; (ii) bonus and long-term
incentive opportunities that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable
to the bonus and long-term incentive opportunities provided to such
Transitioned Employees immediately before the Effective Time and consistent
with prior practice; and (iii) benefits provided under Company Plans providing
welfare and retirement benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially
comparable to those benefits provided to the Transitioned Employees
immediately before the Effective Time. The Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and their Affiliates will give the Transitioned Employees credit for, and will
recognize the services of each Transitioned Employee with or recognized by
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not benefit accrual) under any benefit or compensation plan or
arrangement of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates
providing benefits to such Transitioned Employee. Each Transitioned Employees
years of service with or recognized by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
shall be otherwise recognized for all general employment purposes, including
seniority, and calculating vacation, severance, retention, sick pay and
personal time; _provided_ , that any vacation time offered by the Parent in
the calendar year of the Effective Time to any Transitioned  



 

41  Employee shall be offset by any vacation time used by or paid to a
Transitioned Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
calendar year of the Effective Time. In addition, the Parent will (a) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and
service requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to Transitioned Employees under any group health or welfare plan
sponsored by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates except
to the extent such preexisting conditions, exclusion, waiting period or
service requirement had not been satisfied by any such Transitioned Employee
as of the Effective Time under a group health plan sponsored by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and (b) provide each Transitioned Employee with
credit for any deductible, copayment and out-of-pocket limits applicable to
such employees under any such group health plan sponsored by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and paid by the Transitioned Employee prior to the
Effective Time during the calendar year of the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall assume and honor, or
cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to assume
and honor, the International Securities Exchange Profit Sharing Plan (the
"Company Profit Sharing Plan") to the extent legally binding on the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. Any outstanding unvested
options under the Company Profit Sharing Plan to purchase designated property
as provided under such plan shall become fully vested effective as of the
Effective Time (an "Accelerated Option"). Participants in the Company Profit
Sharing Plan shall be required to (i) exercise any such Accelerated Option or
any option under the Company Profit Sharing Plan to purchase designated
property that vests or vested prior to January 1, 2005 ( a
"Grandfathered Option") at any time during the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs; (ii) exercise any option under the Company Profit Sharing Plan
to purchase designated property that vested in 2007 (but prior to the
Effective Time) (a "2007 Option") at any time prior to January 1, 2008; and
(iii) receive payment relating to such Accelerated Option, vested Option and
2007 Option (collectively, the "PSP Options") in accordance with the terms of
the Company Profit Sharing Plan and underlying award agreement. In the event
that a participant does not exercise any PSP Option within the time periods
prescribed herein, such PSP Option shall be cancelled without any payment with
respect to such PSP Option. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all
reasonable actions necessary or advisable to effect the intent of this Section
7.1(b) including amending the Company Profit Sharing Plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall assume and honor, or
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, the
retention program which shall be established prior to the Closing Date
substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 7.1(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) The Parent recognizes that, notwithstanding Section 6.1(f), the employment
agreements listed on the Company Disclosure Schedule are scheduled to expire
on December 31, 2007, and that between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall negotiate in good faith with the
employees covered by such employment agreements for the renewal and extension
of such employment agreements on terms and conditions that are based on the
current terms and conditions  



 

42  specified in such agreements; _provided_ , that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall keep the Parent apprised of the status of the negotiations
and in good faith take into account the Parents comments, and prior to
finalizing any such agreements, obtain the Parents consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld. None of the Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries shall deliver a notice of nonrenewal
of any such employment agreements to any of the employees covered by such
employment agreements before January 1, 2008.

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.1 are solely for the benefit of the
respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 7.1, express
or implied, shall confer upon any Transitioned Employee, or legal
representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement. Nothing herein shall require the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to continue any particular Company Plan or prevent the amendment
or termination thereof (subject to the requirements of this Section 7.1
including, without limitation, the requirement to maintain compensation and
benefits at levels provided in such section); provided, however, that the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not take, or cause to be taken,
any action (by way of amendment, termination or otherwise) that is in
violation of the terms of any Company Plan or applicable Law, nor shall the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation take, or cause to be taken, any such
action that requires the consent, waiver or agreement of the affected
employee (or such employees beneficiary or dependent) without first obtaining
such consent, waiver or agreement.

7.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement of or in connection with any claim or Action that is based in
whole or in part on, or arises in whole or in part out of, the fact that such
Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts
or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent
such Persons are entitled to be indemnified or have the right to advancement
of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Charter Documents and indemnification agreements
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if any, in existence on the date hereof
with any directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with  



 

43  respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Companys Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time (and for so long
thereafter as any claims thereunder are being adjudicated), the Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current directors and officers
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , that if the existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy expires, is terminated or cancelled
during such six-year period, the Parent shall cause to be substituted therefor
policies containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries only with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the
Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
aggregate annual premiums for such policies at any time during such period
exceed 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance as of
the date hereof, the Parent shall be required to provide such coverage as
will then be available at an annual premium equal to 300% of such rate; and
_provided_ , further, that the Company may elect to purchase prior to the
Effective Time, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, a directors and
officers liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program to be in
effect until the end of such six-year period (and for so long thereafter as
any claims thereunder are being adjudicated) with respect to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (such coverage to be on
terms and conditions no less favorable to the covered directors and officers
than such coverage existing on the date hereof). 

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.2 are intended to be (i) for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
personal representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual
may have by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.2 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified
Party to whom this Section 7.2 applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnified
Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Party to whom this Section 7.2
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 7.2).

(d) In the event that the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.2.



 

44 7.3 _Proxy Statement Cooperation_. The Parent shall reasonably cooperate with
the Company in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish all information concerning
the Parent and the Merger Sub as the Company may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.

ARTICLE VIII

COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY AND THE PARENT

8.1 _Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) Each of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly apply
for, and take all reasonably necessary actions to obtain or make,
as applicable, all Authorizations, Orders, declarations and filings with, and
notices to, any Governmental Entity or other Person required to be obtained or
made by it for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
party shall cooperate with and promptly furnish information to the other
parties necessary in connection with any requirements imposed upon such other
party in connection with the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Parent and the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable and before the expiration of any relevant legal
deadline, but in no event later than 10 Business Days following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, file (i) with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the
"DOJ"), the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, and (ii) with any other Governmental
Entity, any other filings, reports, information and documentation required for
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and the Parent
shall furnish to each others counsel such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that may be necessary under the HSR
Act. 

(b) Each of the Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain promptly any clearance required under the HSR Act for the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
the Parent and the Company shall keep the other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC and the DOJ and any other Governmental Entities and shall
comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Parent and the Company shall each use its respective best
efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so
as to enable the consummation of the Merger to occur on or prior to the date
specified in Section 10.1(a)(ii)(A), including, in the case of the Parent, by
taking all such  



 

45  actions, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Parent (or any
of its Subsidiaries) and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take actions
that limit the Parent or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, one or more of its, or its Subsidiaries,
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case, as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent shall not
be required to enter into any structural or conduct remedy with respect to
any material portion of the business, product lines, or assets of Parent and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent
and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to contest, administratively or
in court, any Order of any Governmental Entity or any other Person respecting
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that each of the
Parent and the Company shall both promptly respond to the DOJ or the FTC to
any request for additional information.

(c) Each of the Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide such information to the SEC as is required with respect to the
consideration by the SEC of the amendments to the Charter Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be required to consummate and make
effective the Merger.

(d) The Parent and the Company shall instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate
and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under
the HSR Act and the expiration of the applicable HSR Act waiting period at the
earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and cooperation
include counsels undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately informed
of communications from and to personnel of the reviewing Governmental Entity
and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with and
response to personnel of any Governmental Entity.

(e) Each of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act (the "SEC
Approval"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to, nor
is the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries permitted to, take any
action or accept any condition that is inconsistent in any material respect
with the current understanding of the parties of the principal regulatory
operating assumptions. Further, the Parent shall not be required to, nor is
the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries permitted to, take any other action
or accept any other condition necessary to obtain SEC Approval if such action
or condition will result in a material reduction of the benefits of the
Merger to the Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof the Company shall cause ISE
LLC to prepare and file with the SEC a proposed rule change that is
consistent with the current understanding of the parties of the principal
regulatory operating assumptions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not make any filing with, or submit any drafts of such filing to, the
SEC without providing a  



 

46  written copy of such filing or draft filing to the Parent in advance and
without the prior written consent of the Parent with respect to each such
filing or draft. No party hereto shall participate in any substantive meeting
or discussion with the SEC in respect of any filings and draft filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it
consults with the other party in advance and gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and each party shall furnish
the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and written
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one hand,
and the SEC or members or its staff on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger and the SEC Approval; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no party shall be permitted to submit any such correspondence, filings, and
written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof), or
drafts thereof, to the SEC or members or its staff without the prior written
consent of the other party.

8.2 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been agreed to
by each of the Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the Company nor the
Parent shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statements
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , that
the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, may, without such consent (but
after prior consultation to the extent practicable in the circumstances),
issue such press releases and make such public statements that it believes are
required by (and only to the extent required by) applicable Law or (in
the case of the Company) the rules of New York Stock Exchange. The Company
acknowledges that, in some circumstances, the Parent may need to conduct
general investor relations activities, which will be general in nature and
will not specifically address the details of the transaction, in which case
the Parent will attempt to reasonably consult with the Company.

8.3 _Delisting and Deregistration_. The Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Common Stock to be no longer quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange and to be deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time. The Company shall cooperate with the Parent and
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do
or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under applicable Laws to enable the delisting of the Shares from the
New York Stock Exchange and the deregistration of the Shares under the
Exchange Act.

8.4 _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof
each of the parties hereto shall execute such documents and other instruments
and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company shall
not take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent the
consummation of the Merger.

(A) the Merger is not consummated on or before the first anniversary of the
date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.1(a)(ii)(A) shall not be available to any
party whose breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under
this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before such date;

(B) a Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or taken any other
action, in any case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which Order or other action is final and
non-appealable; or

(C) the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof; 

(iii) by the Parent if:

(A) there has been a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or if any representation or
warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either case such that
the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b) would not be
satisfied and, in either case, such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is
not cured within sixty days after written notice of such breach is given to
the Company by the Parent.



 

50 (B)(1) the Company Board fails to call the Company Stockholders Meeting in
accordance with Section 6.7, (2) the Company fails to include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of the Company Board in favor of the Company
Stockholder Approval, (3) the Company Board effects a Change of Recommendation
or resolves to do so, (4) the Company recommends to the Company Stockholders

agrees or proposes publicly to take any such actions in response to a Third
Party Proposal; or

(iv) by the Company if:

(A) there has been a breach by the Parent of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or if any representation
or warranty of the Parent shall have become untrue, in either case such that
the conditions set forth in Section 9.3(a) or Section 9.3(b) would not be
satisfied and, in either case, such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is
not cured within sixty days after written notice of such breach is given to
the Parent by the Company; or

(B) if prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, concurrently it
enters into a definitive Company Acquisition Agreement providing for a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section, and any purported termination pursuant to
this Section shall be void and of no force and effect, unless concurrently
with such termination the Company pays to the Parent the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 10.4(a)(iii).

(b) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(a)
shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto.

there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company or the
Parent or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates,
except as set forth in Sections 10.3 and 10.4; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the provisions of Sections 10.3 and 10.4 and Article XI of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement.

10.3 _Remedies_. Any party shall have the right, following the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to recover damages sustained by
such party as a result of any willful and material breach by the other party
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, or fraud; _provided_ ,  



 

51   _however_ , that the party seeking relief is not in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
under circumstances that would have permitted the other party to terminate
the Agreement under Section 10.1. Payments made pursuant to Section 10.4 shall
be in addition to any other rights, remedies and relief of the parties hereto
or with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

10.4 _Termination Fee_.

(a) The Company shall pay the Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Parent, a fee of
$84,549,193.00 (the "Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as
follows:

(i) if the Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(iii)(B), the Company shall pay the Parent the Termination Fee in full
on the Business Day following the date of such termination;

(ii) if the Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(a)(ii)(A) or 10.1(a)(ii)(C), or the Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iii)(A) and, prior to such termination
a Qualified Third Party Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or
publicly announced and, within 12 months following such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Qualified Acquisition Transaction (whether or not such
transaction was the one as to which a proposal, offer or indication of
interest had been made or announced prior to such termination), then the
Company shall pay the Parent the Termination Fee contemporaneously with the
consummation of the Qualified Acquisition Transaction; or

(iii) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(iv)(B), the Company shall pay the Parent the Termination Fee in full
at or prior to, and as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of, such
termination.

(b) For purposes of Section 10.4(a), (i) "Qualified Third Party Proposal"
means a Third Party Proposal relating to a Qualified Acquisition Transaction,
and (ii) "Qualified Acquisition Transaction" has the same meaning as
Acquisition Transaction, except that all references therein to "25% or more"
shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%".

(c) In the event that the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee when due,
the Company will also pay the costs and expenses of the Parent or the Merger
Sub in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement, together with
interest on such Termination Fee, commencing on the date that such Termination
Fee became due, at a rate equal to the prime rate quoted in the _Wall Street
Journal_ on the date that such Termination Fee became due.

AGREEMENT.

11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and any party hereto may execute any such counterpart, each of
which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto.
The parties agree that the delivery of this Agreement may be effected by means
of an exchange of facsimile signatures with original copies to follow by mail
or courier service.

11.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement is intended
to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder; except that in the case of Section 7.2 hereof, the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
legal representatives, successors and assigns, are intended third party
beneficiaries of such sections and shall have the right to enforce such
sections in their own names.

11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents, instruments and
other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto

Merger. All Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to be and

11.12 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable
the remaining provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

11.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parent and the Company each agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof and
