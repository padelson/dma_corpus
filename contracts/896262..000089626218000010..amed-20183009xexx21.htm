46 (b) The Sellers acknowledge that they have had in the past, currently have and
in the future may have access to Confidential Information with respect to the
business of the Acquired Companies. Following the Closing, the Sellers agree
that they will keep confidential all such Confidential Information furnished
to them and, except with the specific prior written consent of Buyer, will not
use any such Confidential Information and will not disclose any such
Confidential Information to any Person except (i) representatives of Buyer and
its Affiliates and (ii) their own representatives, provided that these
representatives agree to the confidentiality provisions of this Section
4.3(b); provided, however, that, for purposes of this Section 4.3(b),
Confidential Information does not include such information as (i) becomes
known to the public generally through no fault of the Sellers or their
representatives or (ii) is required to be disclosed by applicable Law or Legal
Requirements, provided, however, that prior to the disclosure by the Sellers
of any information under this clause (ii), the Sellers will give, to the
extent permitted by Law, prior written notice to Buyer of the circumstances
requiring disclosure and provide Buyer with the opportunity to contest that
disclosure. Notwithstanding the above, and for the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, the Sellers shall
have no obligation to Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to the
Confidential Information of the Acquired Companies.

4.4 Access to Information.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, if

the Acquired Companies, and (ii) reasonable access during normal business
hours to the employees and contractors of the Acquired Companies in accordance

will contact and communicate with the payors, referral sources, vendors, and
suppliers of the Acquired Companies in a manner reasonably necessary for Buyer
to prepare for its operation of the Acquired Companies after the Closing,
subject to Buyer's compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements in
connection therewith. Any such access or contact shall be managed by and
conducted through those representatives identified by the Seller, and shall
not be permitted to the extent that (i) it would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the Acquired Companies or (ii) would require the Acquired
Companies to disclose information that, in the reasonable judgment and good
faith of counsel to the Acquired Companies, is subject to attorney-client
privilege or may conflict with any applicable Law or confidentiality
obligations to which the Acquired Companies are bound.

(b) Subject to Section 4.13, no information obtained by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 4.4 or otherwise shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedule, to prevent or cure any breach of warranty, or breach of covenant, or
to otherwise limit or affect any rights of the Buyer Indemnitees under ARTICLE
VII.

or investigations initiated by such Governmental Entities in connection with

be reasonably necessary or advisable, and (v) promptly make any filings or
submissions required under any applicable state antitrust or trade regulation
Law. Each of such parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any

applicable Governmental Entity, in each case as promptly as practicable. Each
of the parties shall (A) promptly notify the other parties of any written
communication to that party or its Affiliates from any Governmental Entity to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and, subject to applicable Law, permit
the other parties to review in advance any proposed written communication to
any of the foregoing, (B) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, not agree
to participate, or to permit its Affiliates to participate, in any substantive

Agreement unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat, (C) use reasonable best efforts
to consult in advance and cooperate with each other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and
proposals to be made or submitted by or on behalf of any party to a
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions, and (D) to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, furnish the other parties with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and written communications between such party and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (unless the furnishing of such information
would (1) violate the provisions of any applicable Law or any confidentiality
agreement or (2) cause the loss of the attorney-client privilege with respect
thereto; provided that each such party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly communicate to the other parties the substance

|

48 of any such communication, whether by redacting parts of such material
communication or otherwise, so that such communication would not violate
applicable Law or cause the loss of the attorney-client privilege with respect
thereto). Further, any party may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably restrict any competitively sensitive material provided to the other
parties under this Section 4.5 as "outside counsel only," and with respect to
material so designated, outside counsel to whom such material is provided may
not disclose the information to others without prior authorization from the
party providing the material.

(d) Promptly following the parties' execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Sellers will give (or will cause the Acquired Companies to give) any

approval fees relating to the filings or submissions to be made pursuant to

provided, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and without limiting

to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate
with the other party hereto in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws and Legal Requirements to satisfy the conditions
specified in this Agreement necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. For avoidance of doubt and without otherwise limiting or
expanding the foregoing, none of the Acquired Companies, the Sellers nor any

otherwise pay any consideration to any third party to obtain any applicable
consent, waiver or approval, unless the payment of such consideration is
required by applicable Law or the terms of the applicable Contract.

the Company shall, and the Company shall cause the other Acquired Companies
to, comply with all applicable Laws requiring notice to employees in the event
of a plant closing, layoff, discharge, termination, relocation or reassignment
of employees, including the WARN Acts. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and
the Company shall be responsible for notices, payments or other obligations
due to any employees, and all notices, payments, fines or assessments due to
any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable federal, state or local
Laws, common law, rule or regulation with respect to the employment,

execution of any additional documents or instruments of any kind, the transfer
of assets or property, the obtaining of consents which may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions hereof and the
taking of all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to
take by the other party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms of
this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments and documents
contemplated hereby, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes hereof
and thereof and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

(b) Neither Buyer, nor any of its Affiliates, will acquire, or agree to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

relating to the Business (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include
Tax Returns of Sellers or any other Person other than an Acquired Company) in
accordance with the record retention policy of Amedisys, a copy of which has
been provided to the Sellers. Without limiting the provisions of Section 4.11
below, after the Closing, for so long as such books and records are retained
by the Acquired Companies in accordance with the record retention policy of
Amedisys, the Sellers and their accountants, lawyers and representatives shall
be entitled, upon reasonable advance written notice, to have access to and to
make copies (at the Sellers' expense) of the pre-Closing books and records of
the Acquired Companies for purposes of the preparation of Tax Returns. In the
event of any litigation or threatened litigation between the parties relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the covenants
contained in this Section 4.10 shall not be considered a waiver by any party
of any right to assert the attorney-client privilege.

4.11 Certain Tax Matters.


 

--- 
| | 

|

50 (a) Sellers shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, when
due any Income Tax Return that is required to be filed by or with respect to
the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date that is an Income Tax Return of
any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Period. Such Tax Returns shall, at
Sellers' option, include safe harbor elections under Revenue Procedure 2011-29
and shall treat, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, Company expenses as
arising and deductible in the tax years that end on or prior to the Closing
Date. The Sale Bonus Payment shall be treated as a deductible by the Company
in the tax year that ends on the Closing Date. Sellers shall provide Buyer
with a draft of any such Tax Return not less than thirty (30) days prior to
its due date and shall consider in good faith any comments on such draft
received by Sellers not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for
such Tax Return. Each of Buyer and the Company shall, and the Company shall
cause the other Acquired Companies to, provide to Sellers all information in
its possession and under its control which is reasonably necessary or
requested for Sellers to prepare and file such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax
Returns. If Sellers are not authorized under applicable Law to execute and
file such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return, Buyer shall execute and file
(or cause to be filed) such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return with the
appropriate taxing authority. Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, when due any Tax Return that is required to be filed by or
with respect to the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date (i) that is not
required to be prepared by Sellers under this Section 4.11(a) and (ii) is for
any taxable period that begins after the Closing Date or any Straddle Period
(collectively, the "Company Tax Returns"), and shall remit any Taxes due with
respect to such Company Tax Returns. All such Company Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner that is consistent with those prepared for prior taxable
periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by applicable law
or required by this Agreement. Buyer will furnish a copy of such Company Tax
Returns and a copy of related work papers and supporting information to the
Sellers and their tax advisers for their review and written approval at least
sixty (60) days prior to the due date (or extended due date that has been
approved by the Sellers) for filing such Company Tax Returns (or if on the
Closing Date less than sixty (60) days remain before filing is due, one-half
of the days remaining between the Closing and the filing due date).
Simultaneous with furnishing such Company Tax Returns to the Sellers, Buyer
shall provide a written statement to the Sellers setting forth the amount of
Taxes owing on such Company Tax Returns that, in accordance with Section
4.11(b), it believes is owing by the Sellers. Should the Sellers disagree with
the calculation of Taxes shown as being due on such Company Tax Returns or the
amount of Taxes owing therein that Buyer believes is owing by the Sellers, it
shall provide written notification thereof (such notice, a "Tax Dispute
Notice") to Buyer within thirty (30) days of receiving the copy of such
Company Tax Return, and Buyer and the Sellers shall cause their respective tax
advisers to confer in good faith to seek to resolve such disagreement to the
satisfaction of Buyer and the Sellers. If Buyer and the Sellers are unable to
resolve such disagreement within the earlier of fifteen (15) days after the
date on which the Tax Dispute Notice has been provided or seven (7) days prior
to the due date of such Company Tax Return and no extension for the filing of
such Company Tax Return is then legally available, Buyer may file the related
Company Tax Return prior to the expiration of the deadline for the filing
thereof notwithstanding the disagreement being unresolved, with an amended
Company Tax Return to be subsequently promptly prepared and filed if required
by the final resolution of such disagreement pursuant to this Section 4.11(a);
provided, however, it is understood that the indemnification obligations under
this Section 4.11 shall be determined by reference to the post-filing
resolution of the dispute by the parties or the decision of the Independent
Accounting

| | 

|

51 Firm pursuant to this Section 4.11(a) rather than the content of any Company
Tax Return (and the Tax consequences of such Company Tax Return) filed by
Buyer prior to the resolution of the dispute. If resolution of a Tax dispute
described in this Section 4.11(a) is not reached prior to the filing of a
Company Tax Return and such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of
the Company Tax Return being filed, either Buyer or the Sellers may request
that the disagreement be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm. The
calculation of the Taxes due and the party(ies) responsible for the payment
thereof shall be made by such firm within the range of the respective
calculations of Buyer and the Sellers and when so made shall be conclusive,
and shall be binding on, and nonappealable by, the parties. The fees and
disbursement of such firm shall be borne equally by Buyer and the Sellers.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4.11, the Sellers will
defend and indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees against the following Taxes, but
only to the extent such Taxes have not been paid prior to the Closing,
adequately provided for by a liability accrued for Taxes on the Latest Balance
Sheet or resulted in a payment by Sellers or from the Escrow Fund: (i) the
non-payment prior to the Closing of Taxes owed by the Acquired Companies for
any Pre-Closing Period and, under the principles of Section 4.11(c), for the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, (ii) the non-
payment of Taxes of any Person other than the Acquired Companies that are
imposed on the Acquired Companies as a transferee or successor, by contract or
pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing and where the status or relationship of the Acquired
Companies giving rise to the liability for such Taxes of another Person
existed prior to Closing, and (iii) the non-payment of Taxes owed by the
Acquired Companies as a result of their inclusion prior to Closing in a
consolidated tax return group; provided, however, that Sellers shall have no
obligation to defend and indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees against (I) any Taxes
resulting from (x) an election made pursuant to Section 338 of the Code (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law)
with respect to Buyer's purchase or deemed purchase of the capital stock of
any Acquired Company pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Section
338(h)(10) Election explicitly contemplated by this Agreement), (y) any
transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the
ordinary course of business (other than as explicitly contemplated by this
Agreement), or (z) any breach by Buyer of any of its obligations under Section
4.11(m) of this Agreement or (II) the employer's share of any employment Taxes
associated with the Sale Bonus Payment. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 4.11, any Taxes payable by the Sellers pursuant to the foregoing
sentence shall be paid to Buyer in a manner consistent with the terms of
ARTICLE VII.

(c) In the case of any Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are payable with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes that relates to the
portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the
case of any real property, personal property or other ad valorem Taxes be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of
the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any other
Tax be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant
taxable period (and the taxable period of any Subsidiary of such Acquired
Company that is not itself an Acquired Company and which is a pass-through
entity for purposes of the relevant Tax) ended on the Closing Date based on a
closing of the books as of the close of business on the

52 Closing Date; provided, however, that any transaction occurring after the
Closing that is not in the ordinary course of business (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall be deemed to occur in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date.

(d) Buyer agrees that (i) the Company and the Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries
(other than Pathways) will join the consolidated Income Tax Return group of
which Amedisys is the parent corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(and for purposes of any similar applicable state, local or foreign laws) at
the end of the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (ii) as a result, such Acquired Companies will have
a short tax year ending on (and including) the Closing Date and will be
included in the consolidated group's U.S. federal (and similar applicable
state, local or foreign) Income Tax Returns starting the day after the Closing
Date.

(e) In the case of any audit, assessment, suit, proposed adjustment,
deficiency, dispute, administrative or judicial proceeding or similar claim
relating to Taxes relating to any Pre-Closing Period that, if determined
adversely to the Acquired Companies, would be grounds for a claim for
indemnification under this Section 4.11 (each, a "Tax Claim"), the Sellers
shall have the right, at the sole expense of the Sellers, to assume and
control the conduct of such Tax Claim and shall have the right to settle such
Tax Claim; provided, however, (i) that the Sellers will consult with Buyer in
the negotiation and settlement of any such Tax Claim, (ii) Buyer shall be
permitted to participate, at its own expense, in the defense of any such Tax
Claim, and (iii) the Sellers shall not settle or compromise any such Tax Claim
without Buyer's prior written consent, with such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(f) In the case of any Tax Claim relating to any Straddle Period, Buyer and
the Sellers may each participate, at their own expense, in the audit or
proceeding, and the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by Buyer or the
Sellers, whichever would bear the burden of the greatest portion of the Tax
Claim; provided, however, that the party controlling the Straddle Period Tax
Claim (i) shall not settle such audit or proceeding without the consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, and (ii) shall consult with and keep the other party timely informed
with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Claim.

(g) In the case of any Tax Claim relating to the Taxes of any taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the right to control the
conduct of such Tax Claim and shall have the right to settle such Tax Claim
without the consent of any other party; provided, however, that, if such Tax
Claim may give rise to a claim for indemnification against Sellers under this
Agreement, (i) Sellers shall have the right to participate in, but not
control, the defense of such Tax Claim and (ii) any settlement or compromise
of such Tax Claim shall require the prior written consent of the Sellers
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(h) Buyer and the Sellers shall provide each other, and Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Companies to provide the Sellers, with such cooperation and
assistance as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or a Seller in connection
with (i) the preparation of any Tax Return and (ii) any Tax Claims, and until
the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date, each will retain

53 and provide, and Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies to retain and
provide, the other with any requested records or information that is relevant
to such Tax Return or Tax Claim; provided that Buyer and the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, as applicable, shall have the right to redact any
portions of any such records or information that are not solely related to one
or more of the Acquired Companies before providing any such records or
information to the other party. Such cooperation and assistance shall include
making employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis during
normal business hours to provide additional information; provided, however,
the party requesting such information shall advance the reasonable out-of-
pocket cost, if any, to be incurred by the other party in obtaining and making
such information available. Furthermore, the parties will reasonably cooperate
with each other in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, as
described in, and without limiting the provisions of, Section 4.11(j) below.
Such cooperation will include providing records and information that are
reasonably relevant to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 4.11(h), Buyer and the Company agree for the benefit of the Sellers
that they will retain or cause to be retained, until the eighth (8th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, copies of all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies, and work schedules and other records or information that they
possess and that are relevant to such Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies
for all periods commencing on or before the Closing Date.

(i) Except as otherwise provided herein, Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any
Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are the responsibility of Sellers
pursuant to this Section 4.11 within fifteen (15) business days after Buyer's
payment of such Taxes.

(j) Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall cause their Affiliates (as applicable)
to: (A) make a timely joint election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any
corresponding election under state, local, and non-U.S. Tax law) with respect
to the purchase and sale of the shares of Capital Stock of the Company
provided for in this Agreement (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10)
Election"), (B) provide prior to or at the Closing the information necessary
to permit the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be made, (C) take all action
necessary and appropriate (including filing such Tax Returns, forms,
elections, schedules and other documents that may be required) to effect and
preserve the Section 338(h)(10) Election, (D) report Buyer's acquisition of
the Company consistently with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and (E) take no
position to the contrary in any Tax Return, any proceeding before a taxing
authority or otherwise prejudice the Section 338(h)(10) Election. In
furtherance of the foregoing, on the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to
Buyer an executed IRS Form 8023 or any other analogous or corresponding form
required by state or local law, to be filed by Buyer (or, at Buyer's
direction, filed by Sellers) with any state, local or foreign Governmental
Authority to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election. For purposes of executing
and filing the IRS Form 8023, (X) Buyer shall timely execute two (2) originals
of IRS Form 8023, (Y) promptly thereafter Buyer shall provide to Sellers one
(1) executed original of IRS Form 8023, and (Z) Buyer shall timely file one
(1) executed original IRS Form 8023 with the IRS. The contents of the Section
338(h)(10) Election shall be consistent with the Allocation (as defined in
Section 4.11(j)). In the event that the Section 338(h)(10) Election is
disputed by any Governmental Authority, the party receiving notice of such
dispute shall promptly notify and consult with the other party hereto
concerning resolution of such dispute. No election under Code Section
338(h)(10) or any


 

--- 
| | 

|

54 corresponding provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law shall be made with
respect to any of the Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries. Apart from the Section
338(h)(10) Election, no election under Code Sections 338 or 336(e) (or any
corresponding or similar elections under state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law)
shall be made in connection with the transactions provided for herein.

(k) The parties agree that for any Acquired Company that (i) is treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and (ii) will continue to be
so treated after the Closing, a timely election pursuant to Section 754 of the
Code shall be duly made with respect to such Acquired Company, which election
shall be in effect for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date.

(l) The portion of the Purchase Price (and any other consideration paid
hereunder for the Shares) and the liabilities (to the extent included in
amount realized for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) of the Acquired
Companies (other than the Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries) allocable for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes to the shares of Capital Stock of the Company,
plus other relevant items, shall be allocated among the assets of the Company
in accordance with Code Sections 338 and 1060 and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Within sixty (60) days after the determination of the
adjustments, if any, to the Purchase Price hereunder, or, if sooner, ninety
(90) days before IRS Form 8883 must be filed, Buyer will provide to Sellers
copies of IRS Form 8883 and any required exhibits thereto (the "Allocation")
with Buyer's proposed allocation of the Purchase Price consistent with Code
Sections 338 and 1060 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such Allocation, Sellers will
submit to Buyer in writing any proposed changes to such Allocation or shall
indicate its concurrence therewith, which concurrence shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and in the event no such
changes are proposed in writing to Buyer within such period of time, Sellers
will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the Allocation). Buyer and
Sellers will endeavor in good faith to resolve any differences with respect to
the Allocation within fifteen (15) days after Buyer's receipt of written
notice of objection from Sellers. Any unresolved disputes will be resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm, the costs of which shall be borne by each
party in the percentage inversely proportionate to the percentage of the total
dollar amount of the total items submitted for dispute that are resolved in
such party's favor. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be binding
on the parties. Sellers and Buyer shall each timely file IRS Form 8883 by
attaching such form to their respective timely filed U.S. federal income Tax
Returns reflecting the tax effects of the Section 338(h)(10) Election (or any
successor forms, and any forms or schedules similar to Form 8883 that are
required to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election effective under provisions of
applicable state, local, or foreign law) and otherwise in a manner reflecting
the Allocation, and Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each
other in connection with such preparation and filing. All Tax Returns and
reports filed by Buyer, the Acquired Companies and Sellers will be prepared
consistently with the Allocation. None of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or
Sellers shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise)
that is inconsistent with the Allocation unless required to do so by Law. The
parties shall cooperate in updating the Allocation and any IRS Form 8883 with
respect to any post-Closing adjustments to the purchase price hereunder.

(m) Buyer and Sellers shall not revoke the Company's election to be taxed as
an S corporation within the meaning of Code Section 1361 and Code Section
1362. Buyer and Sellers

| | 

|

55 shall not take or allow any action (other than the sale of the Company's stock
pursuant to this Agreement) that would result in the termination of the
Company's status as a validly electing S corporation within the meaning of
Code Section 1361 and Code Section 1362. Buyer shall not, and shall not cause
or permit any of the Acquired Companies to, (i) amend any Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies filed with respect to any Pre-Closing Periods or (ii) make
any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Periods, in
each such case without the prior written consent of Sellers. Other than as
required by this Agreement, Buyer shall not cause or permit the Acquired
Companies to take any action on the Closing Date that is outside the ordinary
course of business (other than any action which the relevant Acquired Company
was required to take under Contracts in place prior to Closing).

(n) Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing Date, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Acquired Companies), and any amounts credited against any Tax to which Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Acquired Companies) become entitled that relate to any Pre-
Closing Period or, under the principles of Section 4.11(c), any Straddle
Period of any Acquired Company, shall be for the account of Sellers, and Buyer
shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit
within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

(o) Buyer shall be responsible for all Transfer Taxes arising in connection
with the transactions provided for in this Agreement and shall be responsible
for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns with respect to such
Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall provide Buyer with such cooperation as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation, execution and filing of
such Tax Returns.

(p) In the event that Sellers make any indemnity payments hereunder, or
amounts are distributed other than to Sellers from the Escrow Fund, the
Sellers shall make payments between themselves to properly reflect, in light
of their relative direct and indirect interests sold hereunder in respect of
the Acquired Companies, the extent to which such payments and distributions
are attributable to specific Acquired Companies. This provision shall be
enforceable only by the Sellers.

4.12 Release by the Sellers. Effective as of the Closing, the Sellers release
each Acquired Company, its successors and assigns, and its Affiliates,
members, managers, directors, and officers from any claim, demand, lien,
liability, debt, right, set-off, trespass, tort, wrong, covenant, action,
suit, expense, damage, judgment, order and liability of whatever kind or
nature, in law or in equity, under contract, in tort, by statute or otherwise,
whether known or unknown, vested or contingent, suspected or unsuspected, and
whether or not concealed or hidden, that were or could have been asserted in
any suit, arbitration or mediation, in any jurisdiction, state, federal or
otherwise, under any law, state, federal or otherwise, whether arising out of
or relating to, in whole or in part, the Sellers' ownership of the shares of
Company Common Stock and the Capital Stock of the Acquired Companies, the
Sellers' status as shareholders of the Company, Heching's status as an
employee or officer of any Acquired Company, or otherwise, provided, however,
that in no event shall the foregoing release apply with respect to (a) any
rights with respect to any directors' and officers' insurance policy,
fiduciary liability insurance policy or other similar policy maintained by an
Acquired Company, (b) any salary or other compensation and benefits accrued or
payable through

56 the Closing, including any rights to receive benefits under any Benefit Plan
and any business expense reimbursement in the ordinary course of business, (c)
any claims against Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) unrelated to the transactions contemplated hereby, or (d) any other
agreement that has been disclosed to Buyer in the Disclosure Schedules and
which is not terminated or superseded at the Closing.

4.13 Supplemental Disclosure Schedules.

(a) The Sellers and the Company may, at any time and from time to time not
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, by notice in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, supplement any one or more Parts of the
Disclosure Schedule; provided, that, except as expressly provided below in
this Section 4.13, such supplements shall not be deemed to amend the
Disclosure Schedule or qualify the related representations and warranties of
the Sellers or the Company herein. With respect to any item or matter that
relates solely to actions, occurrences, facts, developments or events that (i)
both arise and become known to the Sellers and the Company, as applicable,
after the date hereof and would have been required or permitted to be set
forth or described in the Disclosure Schedule had such matter existed as of
the date hereof, (ii) does not arise from a breach of this Agreement, and
(iii) either (A) is not material to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole,
or to the Sellers, or (B) arises out of or is attributable to any item
described in parts (i) through (vi) of the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" in ARTICLE I, the item in such supplemental disclosure shall be deemed
to amend the Disclosure Schedule and qualify the representations and
warranties of the Sellers and the Company, as applicable; provided, however,
that any updates to Parts 3.1(k) and 3.1(r) of the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to actions, occurrences, facts, developments or events that arise
after the date hereof shall be deemed to amend the Disclosure Schedule and
qualify the related representations and warranties of the Company to the
extent that the items reflected in such updates were not entered into in
breach of this Agreement, without reference to clauses (i) and (iii) of this
Section 4.13. Any other supplemental disclosures to the Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to amend the Disclosure Schedule, shall be made without
effect to or qualification of any of the related representations and
warranties of the Sellers and the Company contained in this Agreement, and
shall have no effect on the right of the Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification.

(b) Each party will give prompt written notice to the other parties of any
notice or development which has caused a material breach of or inaccuracy in
any of its own representations and warranties in ARTICLE III. Subject to
Section 4.13(a), no such written notice shall be deemed to have amended and
qualified the representations and warranties in ARTICLE III, or to have cured
any material breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty that
otherwise might have existed.

4.14 Additional Covenants.

(a) Financial Statements.

(i) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide
monthly management reports, to include monthly revenues, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, other expenses, patient census and executive employee
headcount, for the Acquired Companies

| | 

|

57 (collectively, the "Monthly Financial Statements"), prepared in accordance
with past practices, no later than sixty (60) days after the end of each
month.

(ii) The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Buyer\'s reasonable requests in order to facilitate preparation of the pro
forma financial statements and historical financial statements required to be
filed by the Buyer with the SEC, including providing such other financial
information as is reasonably necessary to prepare pro forma financial
statements required to be filed by the Buyer with the SEC. The Sellers shall
cause the Company to request the registered accounting firm that audited the
Company's 2017 consolidated financial statements deliver, at Buyer's sole cost
and expense, all required consents for the inclusion of such financial
statements in any filings Amedisys makes with the SEC.

(b) Maintenance of Insurance. The Sellers shall cause the Acquired Companies
to maintain insurance coverage for the Acquired Companies through the Closing
Date no less favorable in the aggregate than the insurance coverages for them
in effect as of the date hereof.

(c) Employees and Integration.

(i) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and Legal Requirements, prior to
the Closing, the Sellers agree to cause the Acquired Companies to provide to
Buyer information and access reasonably requested by it necessary to proceed
with its pre-Closing integration processes, including data conversion
(including patient, payor and employment data) and information technology
installation. The Sellers agrees to cause the Acquired Companies to use
commercially reasonable methods to assist Buyer in the transfer of data from
the networks of the Acquired Companies (or their Affiliates, as applicable) to
Buyer's network, provided that Buyer has executed any instruments necessary to
ensure that such transfer complies with HIPAA and other Legal Requirements
governing the transfer or sharing of confidential patient information. Buyer
shall reimburse the Sellers and the Acquired Companies for any actual out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with the data conversion, data
transfer and information technology installation obligations set forth in this
Section 4.14(c) and such reimbursement will occur within fifteen (15) Business
Days of the Sellers' presentation of invoices and reasonably detailed
supporting documentation to Buyer.

(ii) In addition, the Sellers shall (A) at least thirty-five (35) days prior
to the Closing but no more than forty-two (42) days prior to the Closing, and
(B) at least fourteen (14) days prior to the Closing but no more than twenty-
one (21) days prior to the Closing, provide Buyer with an updated true and
correct list of (1) the name, state of residence, title, employer, length of
service, hourly pay rate and annualized pay rate, fixed bonuses, and
discretionary bonuses of each officer or employee of the Acquired Companies
employed or engaged in the Business as of such date, and (2) any other form of
compensation (other than salary, bonuses or customary benefits) paid or
payable by any of the Acquired Companies to each such officer or employee for
the most recent fiscal year. Further, during the period commencing on the date
of delivery of the aforementioned list in the above clause (B) and ending upon
the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the Acquired Companies not to hire any
additional employees without the prior written approval of Buyer.


 

--- 
| | 

|

58 (iii) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing (or, if earlier,
until the date of termination of the employee's employment with the Acquired
Companies), Buyer presently intends to (or presently intends to cause the
Acquired Companies to) provide (i) salary and target bonus opportunity (or
base pay for non-salaried employees) for each employee of the Acquired
Companies that is substantially comparable to the salary and target bonus
opportunity (or base pay for non-salaried employees) paid to each such
employee immediately prior to the Closing (payable by Buyer in accordance with
Buyer's customary payroll practices) and (ii) retirement and welfare benefits
that are no less favorable than those offered by Buyer to similarly situated
employees; provided, however, nothing herein shall limit the Buyer's ability
to implement operational changes at any time following the Closing (e.g.,
Agency closures, changes in staffing ratios, reductions in staffing, etc.).
From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the service of each
employee of the Acquired Companies with the Acquired Companies (or any
predecessor entities thereof) to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting under any employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates to the same extent
recognized by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing, except to the
extent that such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. With
respect to welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates in
which employees of the Acquired Companies are eligible to participate, Buyer
shall request that the related insurers waive any waiting periods otherwise
applicable to such employees and their dependents under such welfare benefit
plans to the extent satisfied under the applicable Benefit Plan prior to the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer reserves the right to cause the
Acquired Companies to terminate the employment of any "at will" employee at
any time following the Closing, with or without cause, and to exercise all
termination rights available to it under any employment agreement.

(iv) The provisions contained in clause (iii) this paragraph (d) are included
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and nothing in such clause (iii)
whether express or implied, shall (A) create any third-party beneficiary or
other rights in any other Person, including any current or former employees,
any participant in any Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof,
including, without limitation, any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period or to be covered under or by any employee benefit
plan or arrangement, or (B) be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation
of or limitation on the ability to terminate any Benefit Plan or benefit plan
or agreement of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

(d) Bank Accounts. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall deliver to Buyer all documentation required to change
authorizations for the accounts identified on Part 3.1(u)(ii) of the
Disclosure Schedule to the individuals designated by Buyer, with such
documentation to be held in escrow by Buyer and not released until the
Closing.

(e) Corporate Integrity Agreement. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
cause the Acquired Companies to comply with the terms and requirements of the
Corporate Integrity Agreement, including, without limitation, timely making
all reports, repayments and filings with the Office of Inspector General
required thereby; provided, however, nothing in this Section 4.14(f) shall
relieve the Sellers from any liability hereunder associated with any failure
of the Acquired Companies to comply with the terms and requirements of the
Corporate Integrity Agreement prior to the Closing.


 

---

|

59 (f) Section 280G Stockholder Approval. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cause a stockholder vote to be conducted to determine, in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, the right of any "disqualified individual"
(as defined in section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive any and all payments
(or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)
of the Code) to the extent necessary so that no payment received by such
"disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under section 280G(b)
of the Code (determined without regard to section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. Consistent
with section 280G(b)(5) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, such vote
shall establish the "disqualified individual's" right to the payment, benefit
or other compensation to the extent necessary so that no such payment received
by such "disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under section
280G(b) of the Code. At the Closing, the Company shall provide Buyer
stockholder resolutions or stockholder consents evidencing that such vote has
been conducted in accordance with this Section 4.14(i) (such resolutions or
consents, the "280G Resolutions").

(g) Contracts. Within thirty (30) days after the Closing, Sellers shall
provide Buyer with a list of the Core Service Contracts, listed by provider
number, together with true, correct and complete copies thereof.

(h) Dissolution of Inactive Acquired Companies and Release of Encumbrances.
Sellers and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i)
those Acquired Companies listed on Schedule 4.14(h) to be dissolved prior to
the Closing, and (ii) any and all Encumbrances on the assets of the Acquired
Companies, including, but not limited, to those set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, to be released and discharged prior to the Closing.

4.15 Payment and Performance Guarantee by Amedisys. Amedisys hereby
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a primary obligor
and not merely a surety, to the Company and the Sellers (i) the performance of
all obligations of Buyer under this Agreement to the extent such obligations
are to be performed prior to or at the Closing and (ii) the due and punctual
payment by Buyer of all payments of Purchase Price owing by Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.4 of the Agreement (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the
"Guaranteed Obligations"). The guarantee by Amedisys set forth in clause (i)
above shall terminate upon consummation of the Closing. The guarantee by
Amedisys set forth in this Section 4.15 shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment or performance of
the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the
Sellers upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Amedisys or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. This is a guarantee
of payment and performance, as applicable, and not of collection only. The
Sellers shall not be required to make any demand upon, or to pursue or exhaust
any right or remedy against, the Buyer prior to exercising its rights under
this Section 4.15, and no delay or omission on the part of Sellers in
exercising rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver or relinquishment of
such rights or remedies. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Amedisys
hereby expressly, unconditionally and irrevocably waives any and all rights or
defenses arising by reason of any law which would otherwise require any
election of remedies by the Sellers (but, for the avoidance of doubt, does not
waive any


 

--- 
| | 

|

60 right or defense arising under any provision of this Agreement that requires
election of remedies by the Sellers). Amedisys waives promptness, diligence,
notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of incurrence of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
notices of any kind, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Buyer
or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation,
stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect and all
suretyship defenses generally (other than defenses to the payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations that are available to Buyer under this Agreement).

7.4 Indemnification Procedures and Related Provisions and Additional
Limitations.

(a) Any party entitled to make a claim for indemnification hereunder (an
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify (a "Claim Notice") the indemnifying
party (the "Indemnifying Party") of the claim in writing upon learning of such
claim or the facts constituting such claim, describing the claim in reasonable
detail, the amount thereof, and the basis therefor, and in the case of any
claims based on a claim by a third party, attach all notices, pleadings and
other documents or instruments served upon or received by the Indemnified
Party with respect thereto; provided that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in giving any such Claim Notice shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay. The
Indemnifying Party's failure to respond to a Claim Notice within thirty (30)
days of its delivery will be deemed to be a denial of the claim.

(b) In the event that Buyer has Knowledge of any audit, challenge, claim or
charge that would reasonably be expected to give rise to indemnification by
the Sellers for any Mandatory Repayments, Medicare and Medicaid Recoupment
Claims, or Healthcare Liability Claims incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees,
without taking the Threshold into account (a "Notice Matter"), the Buyer
Indemnitees shall provide written notice to the Sellers along with all
available documentation relating to such matter. Within ten (10) Business Days
of their receipt of such documentation, the Sellers shall provide Buyer with
comments relevant to reducing or eliminating liability related to the Notice
Matter. Buyer will consider any reasonable comments from the Sellers relating
to such Notice Matter, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce
liability related to the Notice Matter, including submitting responses and/or
appeals via the relevant Government Program's or Private Program's formal
appeals process in accordance with the comments from Sellers. Buyer will not
cease its pursuit of available appeals processes, or enter into a settlement
or compromise with respect to any Notice Matter, except with the prior written
consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Should the amount of Losses due to Mandatory
Repayments, Medicare and Medicaid Recoupment Claims or Healthcare Liability
Claims be reduced subsequent to any payment of Losses hereunder, the Buyer
Indemnitee shall replenish the Escrow Fund or reimburse the Sellers, as
applicable hereunder, for the amount thereof previously paid to the Buyer
Indemnitee promptly upon receipt by the Buyer Indemnitee of reimbursement
therefor under the related Government Program or Private Program.

|

69 (c) In the event that any Action is commenced by a third party involving a
claim (an "Asserted Liability") for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
be indemnified and held harmless hereunder by an Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party in writing
whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Party's
sole cost and expense and with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, to defend against such Asserted Liability. If the
Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend against such Asserted Liability, which
shall require the Indemnifying Party to (i) timely notify the Indemnified
Party in writing that it has assumed such defense and that it will indemnify
the Indemnified Party against any Losses arising out of such Asserted
Liability (subject to any other limitations set forth in this Article VII),
and (ii) provide evidence of its financial wherewithal to do so should the
Indemnifying Party's liability exposure for the Asserted Liability exceed the
remaining balance of the Escrow Fund, the Indemnifying Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to defend and protect the interests of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Asserted Liability. The Indemnified
Party, at its own expense, shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose. If the
Indemnifying Party does not undertake to defend the Asserted Liability (or is
not entitled to defend the Asserted Liability under Section 7.4(e)), the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at its own expense.
The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to any Asserted Liability without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to any Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement or judgment (x) provides for a
full and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party without any admission
of wrongdoing or liability, (y) does not require the Indemnified Party to make
any monetary payments other than those for which it will be reimbursed in full
contemporaneously therewith (subject to the limitations set forth in this
ARTICLE VII), and (z) does not include any non-monetary relief.

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to make available
to each other, their counsel and other representatives, all non-privileged
information and documents available to them which relate to an Asserted
Liability. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies and their employees to, render to each other such
assistance and cooperation as may reasonably be required to ensure the proper
and adequate defense of an Asserted Liability.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 7.4(b), the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of
any Asserted Liability if (i) the Asserted Liability is a criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
has failed to defend or is failing to defend in good faith the Asserted
Liability that is not cured within a reasonable time after receiving written
notice from the Indemnified Party specifying in reasonable detail the manner
in which the Indemnifying Party has so failed or is failing, or (iii) the
relief sought in respect of the Asserted Liability includes non-monetary
relief

|

70 (other than a general boilerplate request for such other and further relief as
the court deems just and proper).

(f) To the extent there is any conflict between this Section 7.4 and the
provisions of Section 4.11 with respect to the procedures involving any Tax
Claim, Section 4.11 shall control.

(g) If any amounts from the Escrow Fund are released to a Buyer Indemnitee
pursuant to a claim under Section 7.2(a)(viii) of this Agreement ("Settlement
Payment"), and the total amounts available to Buyer Indemnitees in the Escrow
Fund are less than $28,000,000 after giving effect to such Settlement Payment,
Heching shall promptly replenish the Escrow Fund by the lesser of (i) the
amount necessary to increase the total of the Escrow Fund to $28,000,000, or
(ii) an amount equal to the Settlement Payment.

7.5 Insurance and Other Third Party Recoveries. In calculating the monetary
thresholds set forth in Sections 7.2(b)(i), 7.2(b)(ii) and 7.3(b)(i), as
applicable, and the amounts otherwise payable to an Indemnified Party, the
amount of any indemnified Losses shall be computed net of (i) payments
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with
respect to such Losses (after giving effect to any applicable deductible or
retention, any out of pocket costs incurred by the Indemnified Party, and any
increase of premium in connection therewith), and (ii) any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party from any other Person with respect to such
Losses (after giving effect to any out of pocket costs incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection therewith) including any Tax savings or
benefits with respect to such Losses actually realized by the Indemnified
Party which savings or benefits is directly attributable to the deductibility
of such Loss (as determined on a "with and without" basis), in each case, net
of any out of pocket costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining,
receiving or accruing such Tax savings or benefits. In the event an insurance
recovery or third party recovery relating to an indemnification payment is
received after the Indemnifying Party has made an indemnification payment
under this Agreement that did not take into account such insurance recovery or
third party recovery, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the lesser of such insurance recovery or
third party recovery (net of any applicable deductible or retention, any out
of pocket costs incurred by the Indemnified Party, and any increase of premium
in connection therewith, as applicable) and the amount of the related
indemnification payment. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of Losses for which it may be
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

7.6 Manner of Payment.

(a) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Twelve Month Anniversary of Closing and
upon Termination of Escrow Period. The Escrow Account shall be in existence as
of the Closing and, except as hereinafter provided, shall terminate at
11:59pm, Central Time, on the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date
(such termination date, the "Second Release Date", and such time period, the
"Escrow Period"). Upon the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing (the
"First Release Date"), Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand ($9,500,000), less
(i) all amounts, if any, previously paid to a Buyer Indemnitee out of the
Escrow Fund to satisfy indemnification claims pursuant to ARTICLE VII prior to
the First Release Date and (ii) 100% of the amount of any unsatisfied and
unresolved claims specified in any Claim Notice delivered in good faith to the

|

71 Escrow Agent (each, an "Unresolved Claim") prior to the First Release Date,
shall be distributed to the Sellers. Upon the Second Release Date, the
remainder of the Escrow Amount, less 100% of the amount of any Unresolved
Claims delivered in good faith to the Escrow Agent prior to the Second Release
Date, will be distributed to the Sellers provided, however, that the Escrow
Period shall not terminate with respect to an Unresolved Claim. As soon as all
such claims have been resolved in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Sellers the remaining
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, if any, not required to satisfy such
Unresolved Claims.

(b) Claims for Indemnification Outside of Escrow. If either (i) the Buyer is
permitted to assert an indemnification claim against the Sellers without first
depleting the Escrow Fund, as permitted by Section 7.2(b)(iv), or (ii) the
Escrow Fund is no longer available or is not adequate to satisfy any Losses
that are subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.4, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 7.2(b)(iii), then after any final decision,
judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal
therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or Buyer and the
Sellers shall have reached an agreement, in each case with respect to an
indemnifiable claim hereunder, the Buyer Indemnitee(s) shall forward to the
Sellers notice of any sums due and owing by the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter and the Sellers shall pay all of such
remaining sums so due and owing to the Buyer Indemnitee(s) in accordance with
this Section 7.6. Any such indemnification obligations shall be paid by the
Sellers to the Buyer Indemnitee(s) within fifteen (15) days after the final
decision, judgment or award was rendered by the Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal
therefrom, or a settlement was consummated, or the Buyer and the Sellers
reached an agreement.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto agrees to deliver such notices to the Escrow
Agent as are required to effectuate the disbursements from the Escrow Account
as contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

7.7 Remedies Exclusive. EXCEPT FOR FRAUD AND EQUITABLE RELIEF, THE REMEDIES
PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE VII SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES
HERETO AND THE OTHER INDEMNITEES NAMED HEREIN AND THEIR HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND
ASSIGNS AFTER THE CLOSING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY BREACH OR
NON-PERFORMANCE OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT
CONTAINED HEREIN.

7.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. For all Tax purposes, the parties
agree to treat indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Tax
Law.

7.9 No Circular Recovery. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Sellers hereby agree they will not make any claim for indemnification against
the Buyer Indemnitees by reason of the fact that the Sellers were a
controlling person, director/manager, officer, employee or representative of
any of the Acquired Companies or was serving as such for another Person at the
request of any of the Acquired Companies (whether such claim is for Losses of
any kind or otherwise

|

72 and whether such claim is pursuant to any Legal Requirement, contract or
otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnitee under this
Agreement or otherwise relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. With respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnitee
under this Agreement or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Sellers expressly waive any right of
subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against
the Acquired Companies with respect to any amounts owed by the Sellers
hereunder.


ARTICLE VIII

ADDITIONAL OPERATIVE PROVISIONS



8.1 Assignment; Binding Effect. This Agreement and the rights hereunder are
not assignable unless such assignment is consented to in writing by Buyer and
the Sellers and, subject to the preceding clause, this Agreement and all the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Buyer may make the following assignments in
its sole discretion: (i) Buyer may (at any time prior to the Closing) assign,
in whole or in part, its rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to
one or more of its Affiliates (including Affiliates which may be organized
subsequent to the date hereof) so long as such assignment would not
substantially delay or be likely to cause the rejection of the requisite
regulatory approvals; (ii) Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement
for collateral security purposes to any lenders providing financing to Buyer
or any of its Affiliates; and (iii) Buyer may assign its rights under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, to any subsequent purchaser of the Capital
Stock of the Company; provided, however, no such assignment shall release
Buyer or Amedisys of any of their obligations hereunder unless Sellers shall
otherwise consent in writing; and (b) either Seller may assign, in whole or in
part, its or his rights under this Agreement to any trust, foundation or other
Person for estate planning or charitable purposes; provided, however, no such
assignment shall release such Sellers of any of their obligations hereunder
unless Buyer shall otherwise consent in writing. Any such permitted assignment
shall be effected pursuant to a form of assignment and assumption agreement
that is reasonably acceptable to the non-assigning parties.

8.2 Choice of Law. This Agreement and all claims arising from and relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by
and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of Laws rules thereof.

8.3 Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial. ALL
JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, SHALL BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION SITUATED IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING
THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES, IRREVOCABLY (A) ACCEPT GENERALLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS, (B) WAIVE
ANY OBJECTIONS WHICH

73 SUCH PARTY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY OF THE
AFORESAID ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (A) ABOVE AND HEREBY FURTHER
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM, (C) AGREE THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL,
RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO SUCH PARTY AT THEIR RESPECTIVE ADDRESSES PROVIDED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8.4, AND (D) AGREE THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN
CLAUSE (C) ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER SUCH PARTY
IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE
AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

8.5 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not be considered in interpreting or construing any
of the provisions contained in this Agreement.

8.6 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each
party hereto shall bear its own costs and expenses (including investment
advisory and legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.7 Entire Agreement; Schedules. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedule hereto), the Escrow Agreement, and the other agreements,
instruments and documents executed and delivered among the parties hereto at
or in connection with the Closing constitute the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such
subject matter; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not supersede the
terms and provisions of the Nondisclosure Agreement, which shall survive and
remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in accordance with
its terms and Section 4.3 of this Agreement. Information set forth on any
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify each Section of this Agreement
to which such Disclosure Schedule relates (or makes cross-reference), as well
as representations and warranties in other Sections of this Agreement but only
to the extent that the specific item on any such Disclosure Schedule is
reasonably apparent on its face as being applicable to such other Section and
only as related to such specific item. No information set forth on any
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of the
Company's or the Sellers' representations and warranties. The inclusion of an
item on any Disclosure Schedule is not evidence of the materiality of such
item for purposes of this Agreement or otherwise, or that such item is a
disclosure required under the Agreement. No disclosure in any Disclosure
Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement,
permit, license, Law or Legal Requirement shall be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred, or shall constitute an admission of liability to any third party.

8.8 Interpretation.

(a) When a reference is made to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such
reference shall be to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule of or to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The conjunction "or" is used in the
inclusive sense of "and/or." Unless the context requires otherwise, words
using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular
number, respectively, and the use of any gender herein shall be deemed to
include the other genders. References to "dollars" or "$" are


 

--- 
| | 

|

76 to U.S. dollars. The terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and
derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement.

(b) This Agreement was prepared jointly by the parties hereto and no rule that
it be construed against the drafter will have any application in its
construction or interpretation.

8.9 Waiver and Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
supplemented or the performance hereof waived only by a written mutual
agreement executed and delivered by Buyer and the Sellers. Any amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver effected in accordance with this Section
8.9 shall be binding on all parties hereto, regardless of whether any such
party has consented thereto. No waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with any obligations, covenant, agreement or condition shall
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

8.10 Third-party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in
this Agreement, including, without limitation, in Article VII, this Agreement
is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and
nothing herein express or implied shall give or be construed to give to any
Person, other than the parties hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder.

8.11 Non-Recourse. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement or the other agreements, instruments and documents contemplated
hereby (the "Transaction Documents"), or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or the Transaction Documents (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents), may be made only against the Persons that
are expressly identified as parties hereto and thereto. No Person who is not a
named party to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, including
any past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, equityholders (including stockholders and
optionholders), Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named
party to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents ("Non-Party Affiliates"),
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity,
or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party
against its owners or affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising
under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or such other
Transaction Documents (as the case may be) or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or such other Transaction Documents
(as the case may be) or the negotiation or execution hereof or thereof and
each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are
expressly intended as third party beneficiaries of this provision of this
Agreement.

8.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction
under Section 8.3, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision hereof.

8.13 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterpart signature pages, each of which will be deemed to be an
original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be
deemed to constitute one and the same


 

--- 
| | 

|

77 agreement, which shall be binding upon all of the parties hereto
notwithstanding the fact that all parties are not signatory to the same
counterpart. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages
by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format"
(".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing an original
signature.

8.14 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto
fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the following sentence and
Section 7.7, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 8.3, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement (including
any Actions for damages) and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, none of the parties hereto would have entered into this Agreement.
The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
brought in accordance with this Agreement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary
to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

(b) To the extent any party hereto brings any Action in accordance with this
Agreement to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall automatically
be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action is pending,
plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by
the court presiding over such Action.

8.15 Provision Respecting Representation of the Sellers. Each of the Sellers,
the Company, Buyer and Amedisys hereby irrevocably acknowledge and agree that,
on its or their own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, managers,
partners, equityholders, officers, employees and Affiliates, the Sellers shall
have the right to retain Lowenstein Sandler LLP to represent their interests
in any actual or potential dispute or Action arising under or in connection
with this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (a
"Dispute"). The Sellers, the Company, Buyer and Amedisys acknowledge that
Lowenstein Sandler LLP has represented and performed services for the Company
prior to the Closing and consent to the sharing by Lowenstein Sandler LLP (or
any of its successors) with the Sellers of all information obtained during
such past representation that Lowenstein Sandler LLP (or any of its
successors) believes to be relevant to any


 

--- 
| | 

|

78 Dispute. Buyer consents and covenants not to assert any objection, based on
conflict of interest or otherwise, to any representation of either Seller by
Lowenstein Sandler LLP in any Dispute. The Sellers, the Company, Buyer and
Amedisys further agree and acknowledge that all communications between or
among the Sellers, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, owners or representatives, on the one hand,
and Lowenstein Sandler LLP, on the other hand, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under this
Agreement, or any Dispute (the "Protected Seller Communications"), shall be
deemed to be privileged and confidential communications and that all rights to
such Protected Seller Communications, and the control of the confidentiality
and privilege applicable thereto, shall be assigned back to the Sellers for
purposes of any Dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between the Buyer or the Company and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by Lowenstein Sandler LLP to such third party; provided, however, that the
Company may not waive such privilege for Protected Seller Communications
without the prior written consent of the Sellers.
