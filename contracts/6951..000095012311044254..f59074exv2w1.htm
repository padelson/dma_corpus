Consideration, then the amount payable under this Section&nbsp;5.3(a) with respect to such 2006 Plan
Vested Company Option shall be zero). Each holder of a 2006 Plan Vested Company Option cancelled as

granted under the Company&#146;s Omnibus Stock Plan, as amended and is vested, outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time; or (ii)&nbsp;is outstanding, unexercised and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such Company Option under clause &#147;(i)&#148; and
&#147;(ii),&#148; a &#147;<B>Continuing Option</B>&#148;), shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent
Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent: (A)&nbsp;assuming such Continuing Option; or
(B)&nbsp;replacing such Continuing Option by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement stock option to
purchase Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms
(as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan and the terms
of the stock option agreement by which such Continuing Option is evidenced. All rights with
respect to Company Common Stock under Continuing Options assumed or replaced by Parent shall
thereupon be converted into options with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and
after the Effective Time: (1)&nbsp;each Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised
solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (2)&nbsp;the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to each Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Continuing Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (3)&nbsp;the per share
exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Continuing Option assumed
or replaced by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company
Common Stock subject to such Continuing Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole
cent; and (4)&nbsp;subject to the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Continuing Option is
evidenced, any restriction on the exercise of any Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent
shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Continuing Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption
or replacement of such Continuing Option(except that Parent&#146;s board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company&#146;s board of directors or
any committee thereof with respect to each Continuing Option);provided, however, that if the
employment of any Continuing Employee (other than a Person who has entered into one of the
change-in-control agreements set forth in Part&nbsp;2.14(f) of the Disclosure Schedule) is terminated by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation other than for Cause, death or disability, in all such cases
occurring within one year of the Closing, all Continuing Options held by such Continuing Employee
shall (at termination of employment) immediately vest as to an additional 12&nbsp;months of vesting.
The &#147;<B>Conversion Ratio</B>&#148; shall be equal to the fraction having a numerator equal to the Merger
Consideration and having a denominator equal to the average of the closing sale prices of a share
of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for each of the five
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the &#147;<B>Average Parent Stock Price</B>&#148;);
<I>provided, however</I>, that if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate. For
purposes of this Section&nbsp;5.3(b), &#147;Cause&#148; shall have the same meaning as such term is defined in
Section&nbsp;1.5(b).

such Company RSU becoming entitled to receive a payment, in consideration of such cancellation and
in settlement therefor, in an amount (subject to any applicable Tax withholding) in cash equal to
