AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of May 3, 2011, by and among: Applied Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"); Barcelona Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A. 

  

Recitals 

   

 A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 B. The board of directors of the Company has unanimously: (i) approved this Agreement and the Merger; (ii) determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (iii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger; and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement. 

  

 C. The respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders, and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement; and (ii) approved this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the DGCL. 

  

Agreement 

   

 The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

 Section 1. Description of Transaction 

  

 1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

  

 1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP, 1950 University Avenue, Suite 500, East Palo Alto, California, at 8:00 a.m. (California time) on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted to be waived by applicable law) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 6.4 and 7.4, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions) or at such other time and place as shall be agreed to by the parties in writing. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date." Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company in connection with the Closing and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the 

   ##### 

  

  

State of Delaware or at such later time as may be specified in such
certificate of merger with the consent of Parent (the time as of which the
Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "Effective Time"). 

   

 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time: 

   

 (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety so as to read in its entirety in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by law (subject to Section 5.5); 

   

 (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated so as to read in their entirety in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by law (subject to Section 5.5); and 

   

 (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the respective individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 1.5 Conversion of Shares. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: 

   

 (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be so held and no consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof. 

   

 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and no consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof; 

   

 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this Section 1.5(a) and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c) and 1.8, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $63.00 in cash, without interest; and 

   

 (iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time constitute Company Restricted Stock, then: (i) the Merger Consideration delivered in exchange for such shares of Company Restricted Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition as applied to such Company Restricted Stock; and (ii) the cash consideration included in such Merger Consideration need not be paid until such time as such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses or otherwise terminates; provided, however, that if the employment of any Continuing Employee (other than a Person who has entered into one of the 

   ##### 

  

  

change-in-control agreements set forth on Part 2.14(f) of the Disclosure
Schedule) is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation other than for
Cause, death or disability, in all such cases occurring within one year
following the Closing, any unvested Merger Consideration held by such
Continuing Employee shall (at termination of employment) immediately vest as
to an additional 12 months of vesting and shall be paid promptly thereafter
(except that payment shall be delayed to the extent required to avoid a
violation of Section 409A as determined by Parent in good faith). Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to take such action as
they reasonably agree in good faith to be necessary to provide that, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such right set
forth in any such Company Restricted Stock grant or purchase agreement or
other Contract which the Company had as of the Closing. For purposes of this
Section 1.5(b), "Cause" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:
(A) an act of personal dishonesty taken by the Continuing Employee in
connection with the Continuing Employees responsibilities as an employee and
intended to result in the Continuing Employees substantial personal
enrichment; (B) the Continuing Employee being convicted of, or pleading no
contest or guilty to, (x) a misdemeanor that the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation reasonably believes has had or will have a material detrimental
effect on the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or (y) any felony; (C) a
willful act by the Continuing Employee that constitutes gross misconduct; (D)
the Continuing Employees willful and continued failure to perform the duties
and responsibilities of the Continuing Employees position after there has
been delivered to the Continuing Employee a written demand for performance
from the Parent or Surviving Corporation that describes the basis for the
Parent or Surviving Corporations belief that the Continuing Employee has not
substantially performed the Continuing Employees duties and the Continuing
Employee has not corrected such failure within thirty (30) days of such
written demand; and (E) a material violation by the Continuing Employee of
any written Parent or Surviving Corporation employment policy or standard of
conduct. 

   

 (c) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the consideration to be delivered in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate. 

  

 1.6 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) except as otherwise provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of Section 1.5(a), and subject to Section 1.8, all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Paying Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7. 

  

 1.7 Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select, with the prior approval of the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) a 

   ##### 

  

  

reputable bank or trust company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the
"Paying Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds
sufficient to make payments of the aggregate cash consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.5 (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall
be invested by the Payment Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
aggregate amounts payable under Section 1.5 shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 1.7(c). To the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Payment
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent
to make prompt cash payment under Section 1.5, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained
at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments
under Section 1.5. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five business days after the Effective Time), the Paying Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates or uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book entry ("Uncertificated Shares") shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or Parent, or compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of Uncertificated Shares: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the holder in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly representing such shares or Uncertificated Shares is registered if: (1) any such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer; and (2) such holder shall have paid any fiduciary or surety bonds and any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes have been paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate and each Uncertificated Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.5. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. No interest 

   ##### 

  

  

shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company Stock
Certificates or in respect of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 1.7. 

   

 (c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to former holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including holders of Company Stock Certificates) as of the date that is 180 days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including holders of Company Stock Certificates) who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration. 

  

 (d) Each of the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Award such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 (e) If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of: (i) the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective; or (ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the cash amount that such Company Stock Certificate represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then such cash amount shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement. 

  

 1.8 Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has made a proper demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder withdraws, fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL. 

  

 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through proper withdrawal of a demand for appraisal, failure to perfect such demand or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed automatically to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to represent only, the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such payment or settlement offer. 

  

 1.9 Further Action.

 (a) The Company shall take all action necessary under, and subject to, all applicable Legal Requirements and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting if: (i) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that such action is required in order for the board of directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary duty of disclosure to the Companys stockholders or applicable securities laws, and then only for so long as the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary to give the Companys stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to stockholders or otherwise made available to stockholders by issuing a press release or filing materials with the SEC (it being understood that this clause "(i)" shall not permit any adjournment or postponement as a result of the fact that a waiting period has not expired, or a Consent has not been obtained, under any applicable Antitrust Law); (ii) the Company has provided a written notice to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section 5.2(d)(i) or Section 5.2(d)(ii) that it intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or take action pursuant to Section 8.1(h) with respect to a Superior Offer and the deadline contemplated by Section 5.2(d)(i) or Section 5.2(d)(ii), as applicable, with respect to such notice has not been reached, but only until the applicable deadline has been reached; or (iii) there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum at such meeting or to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote, but only until a stockholders meeting can be held at which there are a sufficient number of shares present or represented to obtain such a quorum or the Company Stockholder Vote (and in no event for more than 60 days after the date originally scheduled for the Company Stockholders Meeting). The Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company and Parent) as promptly as practicable after the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Provided that there shall not have occurred a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of the Company: (i) has determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (ii) has approved this Agreement and approved the other transactions contemplated hereby and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL; and (iii) recommends that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting. (The determination that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and the recommendation of the Companys board of directors that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement are collectively referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation.") The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Proxy Statement includes the opinion of the financial advisor referred to in Section 2.21. 

  

 (c) Neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall: (i) except as provided in Section 5.2(d), withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or permit the withdrawal or modification in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub of, the Company Board Recommendation or recommend the approval, acceptance or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or approve, endorse, accept or adopt any Acquisition Proposal (each such action, a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"); (ii) except as provided in Section 8.1(h), cause or permit any Acquired Corporation to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar document or Contract constituting or relating directly or indirectly to, or that contemplates or is intended or could reasonably be expected to result directly or indirectly in, an Acquisition Transaction, other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in clause "(iv)(B)" of Section 4.3(b); or (iii) resolve, agree or publicly propose to, or permit any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation to agree or publicly propose to, take any of the actions referred to in this Section 5.2(c). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clause "(i)" of Section 5.2(c), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the board of directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in the case of clause (i) below, may also take action pursuant to Section 8.1(h): 

   

 (i) if: (A) an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach of any of the provisions of Section 4.3 or Section 5.2; (C) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer; (D) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the Companys board of directors is reasonably required to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in order for the Companys board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; and (E) no less than four days prior to making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or taking action pursuant to Section 8.1(h), the Company delivers to Parent a written notice: (1) stating that the Company has received a Superior Offer that did not result from a material breach of any of the provisions of Section 4.3 or Section 5.2; (2) stating that the Companys board of directors intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or take such action pursuant to Section 8.1(h) as a result of such Superior Offer; (3) specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Offer, including the identity of the Person making such Superior Offer; and (4) attaching copies of the most 

   ##### 

  

    

current and complete draft of any Contract relating to such Superior Offer and
all other material documents relating to such Superior Offer; _provided_ ,
that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of
such Superior Offer shall require a new notice and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.2(d)(i)
except that the references to the four day period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two business day period (such required notice period pursuant
to this Section 5.2(d)(i), a "Superior Offer Notice Period"); or 

   

 (ii) if: (A) there shall arise after the date of this Agreement any change in circumstances affecting the Acquired Corporations that does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal and that leads the Companys board of directors to consider withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation (any such change in circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal being referred to as, a "Change in Circumstances"); (B) the Companys board of directors reasonably determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice, if the board of directors of the Company deems such advice appropriate, of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, the withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation is reasonably required in order for the Companys board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; and (C) no less than four business days prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation (a "Change in Circumstances Notice Period" and together with a Superior Offer Notice Period, a "Notice Period"), the Companys board of directors delivers to Parent a written notice: (1) stating that a Change in Circumstances has arisen; (2) stating that it intends to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in light of such Change in Circumstances and describing any intended modification of the Company Board Recommendation; and (3) containing a reasonably detailed description of such Change in Circumstances ( _provided_ , _however_ , that a public disclosure by the Company or its board of directors or any committee thereof limited to a factual description of a Change in Circumstances and any action taken by the board of directors of the Company with respect thereto that such disclosing party determines in good faith is reasonably required to comply with applicable Legal Requirements shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and shall not be prohibited by this Section 5.2(d)(ii) as long as such disclosure contains a statement to the effect that there has not occurred a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and that no such Company Adverse Recommendation Change will occur until the Company has complied with the notice and related provisions set forth in Section 5.2(d)(ii)); and 

   

 (iii) (A) with respect to either Section 5.2(d)(i) or Section 5.2(d)(ii), throughout the applicable Notice Period, the Company engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that, with respect to Section 5.2(d)(i), such Superior Offer ceases to constitute a Superior Offer or, with respect to Section 5.2(d)(ii), no withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation would be legally required as a result of such Change in Circumstances and (B) following the end of such Notice Period, the board of directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in response to the notices required by Section 5.2(d)(i) and Section 5.2(d)(ii), that such Superior Offer continues to constitute a Superior Offer, or in light of such Change in Circumstances, the withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation continues to be required in order for the Companys board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law, as applicable. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) The Company shall ensure that any Company Adverse Recommendation Change: (x) does not change or otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement by the Companys board of directors or any other approval of the Companys board of directors; and (y) does not have the effect of causing any corporate takeover statute or other similar statute (including any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or "fair price" statute) of the State of Delaware or any other state to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (f) Subject to Section 5.2(a) and Section 8.1(h), the Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in Circumstances or by any Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall not submit any Acquisition Proposal to a vote of its stockholders. 

  

 (g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or its board of directors or any committee thereof from: (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or a Change in Circumstances, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders); or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the Company); provided that, in the case of clause "(i)" or "(ii)" of this sentence, the board of directors of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure. 

 

 5.3 Company Stock Awards and ESPP.

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Option that: (i) was granted under the Companys Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (including such Company Options that vest contingent on the Merger); or (ii) is otherwise identified by Parent prior to the Effective Time with respect to Company Options granted in one or more non-U.S. jurisdictions (the "Specified Options"), in each case under clause "(i)" or "(ii)" of this sentence that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (each Company Option referred to in clause "(i)" or "(ii)" of this sentence, an "2006 Plan Vested Company Option") to be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the cancellation thereof the holder of each such 2006 Plan Vested Company Option shall be granted the right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such 2006 Plan Vested Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation, an amount (subject to any applicable Tax withholding) in cash equal to: (i) the Merger Consideration;  _minus_ (ii) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such 2006 Plan Vested Company Option (it being understood that, if the exercise price payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to any such 2006 Plan Vested Company Option exceeds the Merger Consideration, then the amount payable under this Section 5.3(a) with respect to such 2006 Plan Vested Company Option shall be zero). Each holder of a 2006 Plan Vested Company Option cancelled as provided in this Section 5.3(a) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash consideration (if any) specified in this Section 5.3(a), without interest. Parent shall cause the cash payments described in this Section 5.3(a) to be paid promptly following the Effective Time, without interest and less applicable Tax withholding. No 2006 Plan Vested Company Option shall be assumed by Parent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (other than a Specified Option) that: (i) was granted under the Companys Omnibus Stock Plan, as amended and is vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) is outstanding, unexercised and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such Company Option under clause "(i)" and "(ii)," a "Continuing Option"), shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent: (A) assuming such Continuing Option; or (B) replacing such Continuing Option by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement stock option to purchase Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Continuing Option is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Continuing Options assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (1) each Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (2) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Continuing Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (3) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Continuing Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (4) subject to the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Continuing Option is evidenced, any restriction on the exercise of any Continuing Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Continuing Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Continuing Option(except that Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to each Continuing Option);provided, however, that if the employment of any Continuing Employee (other than a Person who has entered into one of the change-in-control agreements set forth in Part 2.14(f) of the Disclosure Schedule) is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation other than for Cause, death or disability, in all such cases occurring within one year of the Closing, all Continuing Options held by such Continuing Employee shall (at termination of employment) immediately vest as to an additional 12 months of vesting. The "Conversion Ratio" shall be equal to the fraction having a numerator equal to the Merger Consideration and having a denominator equal to the average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for each of the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Average Parent Stock Price");  _provided, however_ , that if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate. For purposes of this Section 5.3(b), "Cause" shall have the same meaning as such term is defined in Section 1.5(b). 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and either unvested, or outstanding and vested but the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto not yet delivered, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled, with the holder of each such Company RSU becoming entitled to receive a payment, in consideration of such cancellation and in settlement therefor, in an amount (subject to any applicable Tax withholding) in cash equal to the product of: (i) the Merger Consideration; _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the outstanding portion of such Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

Each holder of a Company RSU cancelled as provided in this Section 5.3(c)
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the cash consideration specified in this Section 5.3(c) without
interest. Parent shall cause the cash payments described in this Section
5.3(c) to be paid, without interest and less applicable Tax withholding,
promptly following the Effective Time (and in all cases within 30 days of the
Effective Time), unless a later payment date is required by Section 409A. No
Company RSU shall be assumed by Parent. 

   

 (d) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than 20 business days after the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the assumed and replaced Continuing Options, to the extent that such shares of Parent Common Stock can be registered on a Form S-8. 

  

 (e) At the Effective Time, if Parent determines that it desires to do so, Parent may assume any or all of the Company Equity Plans or merge any such Company Equity Plan into any equity incentive plan of Parent. If Parent elects to so assume or merge any Company Equity Plan, then, under such Company Equity Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company Equity Plan as of the Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination of Continuing Options that are assumed or replaced by Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(b)), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Equity Plan. 

  

 (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.3 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Options and Company RSUs have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 5.3. 

  

 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary to: (i) cause any outstanding offering period under the ESPP to be terminated no later than the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective; (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise (as of no later than the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective) of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP; and (iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period shall commence under the ESPP after the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that the actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iv)" of this sentence shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On such new exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company shall terminate the ESPP. 

 

 5.4 Employee Benefits.

    ##### 

  

     

 (a) During the one year period commencing on the Closing Date (but only as long as the relevant Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent) Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided) to each Continuing Employee a base salary or base wages, as applicable, incentive bonus opportunities and benefits at a rate, respectively, or level (as applicable) that is substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or the applicable Affiliate of Parent. 

  

 (b) If Parent elects not to maintain the Surviving Corporations benefit plans and programs after the Effective Time, then, subject to any necessary transition period and subject to any applicable Parent plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements: (i) all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents benefit programs (including its health, paid time off (or similar program) and 401(k) plans), to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or the applicable Affiliate of Parent; and (ii) for purposes of determining a Continuing Employees eligibility to participate in such plans (but not for purposes of calculations of benefits or otherwise), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that such Continuing Employee shall receive credit under such plans for his or her years of continuous service with the Acquired Corporations or a predecessor company prior to the Effective Time to the same extent as such service was recognized under any analogous Company Employee Plan in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except in each case, where doing so would result in duplication of benefits. Parent shall waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any Parent benefit program that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs. 

  

 (c) Nothing in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except for Indemnified Persons (as defined in Section 5.5(a)) to the extent of their rights pursuant to Section 5.5, no Company Associate, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.4(c) shall limit the effect of Section 9.8. 

  

 (d) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective. The Company also shall take such other actions reasonably connected to terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request in good faith. If the Company knows that the distributions of assets from the trust of any Company 401(k) Plan that is terminated pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) are reasonably anticipated to cause or result in liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such Company 401(k) Plan or upon the Company or any participating employer, then the Company shall make a good faith reasonable estimate of the amount of such charges or other fees and provide its estimate of that amount in writing to Parent at least two business days prior to the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Parent hereby acknowledges that this transaction constitutes a "change of control" for purposes of the Contracts identified in Part 5.4(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, and Parent shall honor, or cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms, such Contracts, and shall, to the extent necessary to avoid immediately triggering the acceleration or payment of any benefits thereunder, assume and guarantee the performance of such Contracts as such Contracts may be modified in writing by agreement of Parent and the individual employee subject to such Contract. 

  

 (f) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to agree on how they can cause such notification or consultation requirements to be complied with prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Acquired Corporations and Parent shall consult with (and take into account the reasonable views of) one another with respect to communications to Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment matters. 

 

 5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

   

 (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company existing in favor of those Persons who are or were directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions as such occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in those indemnification agreements between the Company and said Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the Companys standard form as attached as Exhibit 10.7 to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2010 or as identified in Part 5.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, which shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect (to the extent such rights are available under and consistent with applicable Delaware law) for a period of six years from the date on which the Merger becomes effective (and until the final disposition of any Legal Proceeding commenced during such period in respect of any Indemnified Person); _provided_ that any such agreements shall remain in effect in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (or, at the Companys option, Parent) shall purchase a prepaid, non-cancellable "tail" policy on the existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from the Effective Time and otherwise on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the terms and conditions provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the Company shall not, without the prior consent of Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to, expend an amount for such tail policy in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its directors and officers liability insurance (the "Maximum Amount"); _provided_ , _further_ , that if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an aggregate premium in excess of the Maximum Amount, the Company may, and Parent and Merger Sub shall only be required to, spend up to the Maximum Amount to purchase a policy with the greatest coverage as may be obtained by paying an aggregate premium equal to the Maximum Amount. 

  

 (c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding 

   ##### 

  

  

elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to
the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on
the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5. 

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 5.5 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware law or any other applicable Legal Requirement or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. 

 

 5.6 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

   

 (a) Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file: (i) the notification and report forms required to be filed or other documentation required under the HSR Act and (ii) any notification or other document required to be filed in connection with the Merger under any applicable foreign Legal Requirement relating to antitrust or competition matters, including in any Specified Foreign Jurisdiction (as defined in Section 6.5), and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods or applicable Consents thereunder. The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to: (A) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation; and (B) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust or competition authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or competition matters. 

  

 (b) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and the Company each shall promptly supply the other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate any filings (including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its obligations set forth in) Section 5.6(a). Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements or any Governmental Body, and subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall (each through its counsel): (i) consult with the other prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing; (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Body by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with any Legal Proceeding related solely to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including any such Legal Proceeding relating to any antitrust, competition or fair trade Legal Requirement); (iii) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such information; and (iv) promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, notices, analyses, 

   ##### 

  

  

presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, opinions, proposals and other
submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made or submitted by
such party with or to any Governmental Body related solely to this Agreement
