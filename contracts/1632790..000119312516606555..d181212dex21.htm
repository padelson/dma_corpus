AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants
contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I  MERGER OF MERGERSUB WITH AND INTO HOLDING

 

1.1 _Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.2_), MergerSub
shall be merged with and into Holding in accordance with the terms of, and
subject to the conditions set forth in, this Agreement and the DGCL (the "
_Merger_ "). Following the Merger, Holding shall continue as the surviving
corporation (as such, " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent and the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall
cease.

1.2  _Effective Time_. Contemporaneously with the Closing (as defined in
_Section 2.1_), the parties hereto shall cause a Certificate of Merger
meeting the requirements of Section 252 of the DGCL (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") to be properly executed and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time of filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the DGCL, or at such later time which the parties hereto shall
have agreed upon and designated in such filing as the effective time of the
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, but subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of Holding and
MergerSub shall vest in Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations and duties of Holding and MergerSub shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of Surviving Corporation.

 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit B_ until duly
amended in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. The bylaws of
MergerSub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, until duly amended
in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements.

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. Until duly removed or until successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, the directors of MergerSub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of Surviving Corporation as
of the Effective Time and the officers of MergerSub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time.

 

1.6 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any party:

 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of MergerSub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Surviving Corporation, so that, after
the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Surviving Corporations common stock.

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001, of Holding (" _Common Stock_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
any shares of Common Stock cancelled and retired in accordance with _Section
1.6(c)_ and any Dissenting Shares) and all rights in 

 



2  respect thereof, shall by virtue of the Merger at the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such
share of Common Stock as provided in _Section 1.11(a)_, (A) the Initial Per
Share Merger Consideration, payable in accordance with _Article I_ and (B)
such additional amounts as may be payable to such Stockholder from time to
time after the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.8_ or the Escrow Agreement, in
cash, payable to the holder thereof without interest, and such shares shall
otherwise cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and cease to
exist.

(c) Each share of Common Stock held by Holding or held in the treasury of
Holding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
without any conversion thereof, and no consideration shall be delivered, and
no payment or distribution shall be made, with respect thereto.

 

1.7 _Estimated Merger Consideration_. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Estimated Merger Consideration_ " will be an aggregate amount equal to:

(a) Three Hundred Forty Million Dollars ($340,000,000);

 

(b) _plus_ , the excess, if any, of estimated Working Capital as of the
Closing (" _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ") over the Working Capital
Target;

(c) _minus_ , the excess, if any, of the Working Capital Target over the
Estimated Closing Working Capital;

(d) _plus_ , an amount equal to the estimated Closing Cash of the Entities as
of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ");

(e) _minus_ , an amount equal to the estimated outstanding Indebtedness of the
Entities as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Closing
Indebtedness_ ");

(f) _minus_ , an amount equal to the estimated Seller Transaction Expenses to
be paid at, or payable as of, the Closing (the " _Estimated Seller Transaction
Expenses_ ").

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that payment for any adjustment with
respect to the Estimated Closing Working Capital, Estimated Closing Cash,
Estimated Indebtedness and/or Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses pursuant
to  _Section 2.8_ may occur after the Closing pursuant to _Article II_ , but
nevertheless will be deemed to be part of the Merger Consideration.

 

1.8 _Payment of Estimated Merger Consideration_. The Estimated Merger
Consideration, and each component thereof set forth in _Sections 1.7(a)_ 
_(f)_ , and Closing Date Stockholder Proceeds (as defined herein) shall be set
forth on a "funds flow memo" to be prepared by Holding in good faith and
delivered to Parent at least three (3), but no more than ten (10), Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing Funds Flow Statement_ ") and be
subject to post-closing adjustment as provided in _Section 2.7_ and _2.8_. To
avoid doubt, any item included as a current liability in the Estimated
Working Capital shall not also be included as Estimated Closing Indebtedness
to the extent of such inclusion. The Estimated Merger Consideration, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.7_ and _2.8_ , is referred to herein as the
" _Merger Consideration_." The Closing Funds Flow Statement shall be subject
to approval by Parent and Representative, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed by either. Parent and Representative shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly resolve any
disagreements with respect to the Estimated Merger Consideration in good faith
prior to the Closing Date, and Representative shall give Parent access to the
relevant books and records of Holding and the work papers of Holding and
Representative prepared specifically in connection with the Closing Funds Flow
Statement; provided, however, that any such access to the work papers of
Holdings or Representatives outside accountants shall be conditioned upon
Parents execution of customary indemnification and confidentiality
agreements. Parent and Representative shall acknowledge the Closing Funds
Flow 

 



3  Statement as finally agreed (it being understood that Parent does not waive
any rights to take a contrary position to that reflected in the Closing Funds
Flow Statement in connection with the preparation of Parents Report or any
calculation set forth therein, or for any other purpose under this Agreement
or otherwise). The Closing Funds Flow Statement (and the calculations therein)
shall be determined in accordance with GAAP consistent with past practices
consistently applied, subject to the line items and methodologies set forth on
_Schedule 1.8(a)_ (such method of determination is referred to as the "
_Accounting Principles_ ") and shall set forth (i) the Estimated Closing
Working Capital, (ii) the sources and uses of funds at Closing, and (iii) the
amounts of the Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Indebtedness and
Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses (including, without limitation (A) a
calculation of (x) all amounts payable as a " _Gain Share Payment_ ," in
respect of any "Gain Share" or other "phantom equity" or similar plan or
program provided for in any employment, stockholder, subscription or similar
agreement, assuming for this purpose that 100% of the Escrow Amount will be
payable to the Stockholders and Gain Share Recipients (all such amounts
payable to recipients of a Gain Share Payment in the aggregate, the " _Gain
Share Amount_ ") and (y) the employer portion of any payroll, employment or
similar Taxes with respect to such Gain Share Amount (together with the Gain
Share Amount, the " _Full Gain Share Amount_ "), (B) a schedule setting forth
(w) the recipient of any portion of the Gain Share Amount (each, a " _Gain
Share Recipient_ ") and the amount of the Full Gain Share Amount payable to,
or in respect of, such Recipient at Closing (specifying the amount of the
employer portion of any payroll, employment or similar Taxes included in such
Full Gain Share Amount), (x) the amount of the Full Gain Share Amount payable
to such Recipient that is included in the Escrow Amount (the aggregate
portion of the Full Gain Share Amount that is included in the Escrow Amount,
the " _Gain Share Escrow Amount_ "), (y) the percentage of the Escrow Amount
that is attributable to each such Gain Share Recipient and (z) the percentage
of the Escrow Amount that is attributable to the Full Gain Share Amount (the "
_Gain Share Escrow Percentage_ ") and (C) the methodology (under applicable
Law and any applicable Contract) for calculating the amounts due to the Gain
Share Recipients, together with the amount of the employers portion of any
payroll, employment or similar Taxes attributable to such amounts in the event
the Merger Consideration is ultimately determined to be greater than the
Estimated Merger Consideration. Subject to _Section 2.3(c)_, the Closing
Funds Flow Statement also shall include provisions for the repayment in full
by certain executives of the Entities (" _Executives_ ") of loans they
respectively owe to the Entities, in each case as set forth on _Schedule 3.22_
and pursuant to letter agreements in the form of _Exhibit C_ , out of the
proceeds the Executives are otherwise entitled to receive as Stockholders;
such loan repayments shall increase the Stockholder Proceeds otherwise payable
to all Stockholders (pro rata, including the Executives) and not be remitted
to the Entities. At the Closing, Parent shall pay and apply the Estimated
Merger Consideration and shall make such other payments, on behalf of Holding
and the Stockholders as follows:

(a) (i) to pay the Estimated Indebtedness of the Entities at the Closing that
is reflected in an Indebtedness Pay-off Letter to the applicable Pay-off
Lenders, in the amounts set forth in the applicable Indebtedness Pay-off
Letter, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts set forth in such Indebtedness Pay-off Letter and (ii) with respect
to Estimated Indebtedness not reflected in any Indebtedness Pay-off Letter, to
reduce, dollar-for-dollar, the Estimated Merger Consideration (such reduced
amount to be retained by Parent);

(b) to pay (i) all accrued and unpaid management and consulting fees and
expenses, investment banking and financial advisory fees in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby under that certain
Trivest Management Agreement, dated May 1, 2013 (" _Trivest Management
Agreement_ "), as such amounts are set forth in a pay-off, termination and
discharge letter with respect to all obligations of Holding and the Entities
under the Trivest Management Agreement, in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent, and executed by Representative and Fund V (the " _Trivest Pay-Off
Letter_ "), (ii) any investment banking and financial advisory fees incurred
by the Entities in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, as such amounts are set forth a pay-off
letter in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and executed by each broker,
investment banker or other financial advisor with respect to all investment
banking and financial advisory fees incurred by the Entities in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Broker Pay-
Off Letters_ "); (iii) to the Company, the Full Gain Share Amount (less the
Gain Share Escrow Amount), with the portion of the Gain Share Amount to which
each Gain Share Recipient is

 



4  entitled (as set forth on the Closing Funds Flow Statement) to be paid to
such Gain Share Recipient by the Company through its payroll system, less any
applicable Tax withholdings or deductions; and (iv) all other Estimated
Seller Transaction Expenses in accordance with the Seller Transaction Expenses
Documentation;

(c) to pay an amount of cash equal to the Working Capital Escrow Amount to
the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 1.10_ below; and

 

(d) to pay an amount of cash equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount (the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, together with the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the
" _Escrow Amount_ ") to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 1.10_
below.

Each of the foregoing payments by Parent (or its lenders on behalf of Parent,
if applicable) will be considered payments on behalf of Holding and in respect
of obligations and liabilities of Holding. This Agreement does not constitute
an obligation of Holding to pay in full any Indebtedness of Holding
(including without limitation any obligations that are or will be discounted
or forgiven by the holders thereof) other than the amount of Indebtedness
stated in the applicable Indebtedness Pay-off Letter. The amount equal to the
Estimated Merger Consideration _less_ the Escrow Amount is referred to as the
" _Closing Date Stockholder Proceeds_ ") which shall be paid by Parent (or its
lenders on behalf of Parent, if applicable) to Representative at the Closing
in cash. The Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to _Sections
2.7_ and _2.8_ and the other provisions of this Agreement is referred to as
the " _Stockholder Proceeds_." The payments of Closing Date Stockholder
Proceeds and Stockholder Proceeds (pursuant to this _Section 1.8_, pursuant
to _Section 2.8_ and pursuant to _Section 7.3_ or the Escrow Agreement)
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account
or accounts as are indicated by Representative in the Closing Funds Flow
Statement. In lieu of a wire transfer, Representative may elect, by written
notice to Parent, for one or more payments to be made by check.

 

1.9 _Payments to Stockholders_. At the Closing, Representative shall pay out
of the Closing Date Stockholder Proceeds, to each Stockholder, an amount
equal to the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of Common
Stock held by such Stockholder, net of any reserves or holdbacks as may be
agreed to by such Stockholder and Representative pursuant to the applicable
Stockholder Support Agreement. None of Parent, Holding, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability or
obligation with respect to the disbursement by the Representative of the
Initial Per Share Merger Consideration or the Per Share Merger Consideration
to the Stockholders or for any errors or omissions by the Representative in
connection therewith.

 

1.10 _Escrow Agreement_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Parent, Escrow Agent, and Representative will enter into
the Escrow Agreement substantially in the form attached as  _Exhibit D_ (with
such changes as may be agreed by Parent, Holding and the Escrow Agent, the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). At the Closing, in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, Parent shall deliver to Escrow Agent a portion of the
Estimated Merger Consideration in the amount of the Escrow Amount, to be held
in the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the "
_Escrow Account_ "). The Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be
used exclusively to satisfy any amounts payable to Parent pursuant to
_Section 2.8_. Upon the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment,
the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent
solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.8_ in
accordance with the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement. The Indemnity
Escrow Amount shall be used exclusively to satisfy any amounts payable to
Parent or the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.3_ or
pursuant to other claims arising out of this Agreement or relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent permitted to be made
hereunder.

 

(b) Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on the date that is twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date, that portion of the then remaining
Indemnity Escrow Amount (to avoid doubt, as reduced by any disbursements in
accordance with _Section 1.10(a)_) that is not then claimed by Parent to be
owed to a Parent Indemnified Person shall be released to the Representative

 



5  (for further distribution to the Stockholders and Gain Share Recipients) in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, such that, promptly following the
12-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall
be reduced to an amount equal to (i) 50% of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
deposited at the Closing plus (ii) the amount of any such pending claims.
Promptly following the 24-month anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Parent and the Representative shall cause
the Escrow Agent (in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to pay
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds) to such
account(s) designated the Representative, the amount of any remaining
Indemnity Escrow Amount that is not then claimed by Parent to be owed to a
Parent Indemnified Party or subject to a notice delivered pursuant to _Section
9.1(f)_ or _9.1(g)_ , together with any interest earned on any such amount,
for distribution to the Representative (for further distribution to the
Stockholders and Gain Share Recipients), all as may be provided in and
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) Any disbursements from the Escrow Account to the Parent Indemnified
Parties will be treated as a reduction of the Estimated Merger Consideration
and the Merger Consideration.

1.11 _Stockholder Requirements_. Holding and Representative shall comply with
the following provisions applicable to payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration to each Stockholder pursuant to _Section 1.9_:

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Holding will deliver or will cause to be
delivered to each record holder of Common Stock of Holding as of such time
(each, a " _Stockholder_ ") a letter of transmittal substantially in the form
agreed between the parties prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "). The Letter of Transmittal shall specify that
delivery of the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration shall be effected at or
promptly following the Effective Time upon proper surrender of the holders
stock certificates, together with such Letter of Transmittal
properly completed and duly executed, to Representative, and instructions for
use in surrendering such stock certificates, and receiving the Initial Per
Share Merger Consideration in respect of the Common Stock evidenced thereby.
Upon the surrender of each such stock certificate and a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the Representative shall, at or
promptly following the Effective Time, pay to the holder of such stock
certificate the amount from the Closing Date Stockholder Proceeds as
determined in accordance with _Section 1.9_, in consideration therefor, and
such stock certificate shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each
such stock certificate (other than stock certificates representing Common
Stock held by Holding in the treasury of Holding, which shall be cancelled as
provided in _Section 1.6(c)_) shall represent solely the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration from the Representative.

 

(b) On the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Surviving Corporation of any
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). If, after the
Effective Time, stock certificates formerly representing shares of Common
Stock are presented to Surviving Corporation or Representative, such stock
certificates shall be surrendered and canceled.

(c) No interest shall accrue or be paid on the cash payable upon the delivery
of stock certificates or Letters of Transmittal. Neither Parent, Holding, the
Representative nor any party hereto shall be liable to a Stockholder for any
cash or interest thereon delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(d) Representative will deliver or will cause to be delivered to Surviving
Corporation surrendered stock certificates and Letters of Transmittal on the
Closing Date. Stockholders will be entitled to look only to Representative for
payment of their claim for the consideration set forth in this Agreement,
without interest thereon, but will have no greater rights against
Representative than may be accorded to general creditors thereof under
applicable Legal Requirements.

 



6 (e) In the event that any stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit and indemnity (in a form
reasonably acceptable to Representative and Parent) of that fact by the Person
claiming such stock certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
Representative will issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such
affidavit and indemnity, the payments with respect to such stock certificate
to which such Person otherwise is entitled pursuant to this _Article I_.

 

(f) If payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Common Stock is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
surrendered stock certificate of Common Stock is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that the stock certificate of Common Stock so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the stock certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Representative that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable.

1.12 _Withholding Rights_. Parent (or any of its Affiliates, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Holding and the Company, if applicable) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Collateral Agreements such amounts
as Parent (or such Affiliate, if applicable) is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that such
amounts are so withheld by Parent (or such Affiliate, if applicable), such
withheld and deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent (or such
Affiliate, if applicable).

1.13 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) _Effect on Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock held by a holder (a "
_Dissenting Holder_ ") who has properly and timely demanded and perfected such
demand for appraisal of such holders shares of Common Stock in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and as of the Closing has neither effectively
withdrawn nor lost such holders right to such appraisal (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the applicable Merger Consideration,
but shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the DGCL.
Beginning at the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares, if any, will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and extinguished and will cease
to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by Legal Requirements, each
Dissenting Holder will cease to have any rights with respect to such
Dissenting Holders Dissenting Shares other than the rights granted by the
DGCL. Parent shall be entitled to retain any Merger Consideration not paid on
account of such Dissenting Shares (the " _Dissenting Share Consideration_ ")
pending resolution of the claims of such holders, and the Stockholders who are
not Dissenting Holders shall not be entitled to any portion thereof.

 

(b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section 1.13(a)_, if any holder of shares of Common Stock who properly
demands appraisal of such holders shares under the DGCL shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through the failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders
right to appraisal, then as of the Closing or the occurrence of such event,
whichever later occurs, such holders shares of Common Stock shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.6_, without
interest thereon, as and when payable pursuant to this Agreement, following
the surrender of the stock certificate(s) representing such shares of Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 1.11_.

 

(c) _Notice of Dissenting Shares_. Holding shall give Parent: (i) prompt
written notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Common Stock
received by Holding, withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Holding; and (ii) the opportunity
to direct (with the participation of Holding, with respect to periods prior
to the Effective Time, or Representative, with respect to periods following
the Effective Time) all negotiations and

 



7  proceedings with respect to any such demands for appraisal. Holding shall
not make any payment, settlement or settlement offer prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in
writing to such payment, settlement or settlement offer, except as required by
applicable Legal Requirements. Upon any settlement of claims with respect to
any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall direct Representative to promptly return
to Parent, and the Representative shall return, that portion of the Merger
Consideration that would otherwise have been payable to such Dissenting Holder
had the status of such Dissenting Shares not been perfected.

Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "

2016, or, if the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have not been satisfied

final payment in full thereof and the release of any Liens related thereto)
(the " _Indebtedness Pay-Off Letters_ "), and make arrangements, reasonably

Transaction Expense Documentation shall include a release and acknowledgement
of payment from the six (6) Gain Share Recipients receiving the largest
portion of the Gain Share Amount, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent.

the Closing has not occurred, then either Parent or Holding may thereafter
terminate this Agreement by written notice to such effect, to the other

provisions of this Agreement;

iii. By Parent (A) (if it is not in material breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement so as to cause any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ not to be satisfied), upon

Parent that Holding is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger on the

(b) _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated by the parties in
accordance with this  _Section 2.5_, this Agreement shall become void and of
no further effect, provided that (i) the provisions of _Section 9.2_ through
_Section 9.13_ shall survive any such termination; and (ii) no party shall

_Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Holding.

 

ii. If the Company shall be entitled to the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 2.5(b)(i)_, the payment of such Termination Fee shall be deemed to

and assigns and any agents, employees, officers, directors or representatives
of any of the foregoing, the " _Financing Sources_ ") and any of their
respective former, current and future Affiliates, successors and assigns and
any agents, employees, officers, directors or representatives of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any and all

related to or arising out of this Agreement (and the termination thereof), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and/or the abandonment thereof,
including as a result of the failure of the Closing to be consummated), any
agreement executed in connection with this Agreement and any matter forming
the basis for such termination, in each case whether based on contract
(including a claim based on failure to act in good faith), tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any law or otherwise. In no event will the
Termination Fee be payable on more than one occasion.

 



10 2.6 _Closing Balance Sheet and Working Capital Statement_. As soon as
practical (and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date), Parent shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Representative (the
" _Parent s Report_") (i) a consolidated balance sheet for the Entities as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a
calculation of actual Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing
(" _Actual Closing Working Capital_ "), actual Closing Cash of the Entities
as of immediately prior to the Closing (" _Actual Closing Cash_ "), actual
Indebtedness of the Entities as of immediately prior to the Closing (" _Actual
Closing Indebtedness_ ") and actual Seller Transaction Expenses (" _Actual
Seller Transaction Expenses_ ") and (iii) a calculation of any adjustments to
the Estimated Merger Consideration based on such calculations, using such
calculations in place of the components calculated pursuant to  _Sections
1.7(a)_  _(f)_ , to arrive at the Merger Consideration. To avoid doubt, any
item included as a current liability in the Actual Closing Working Capital
shall not also be included as Actual Closing Indebtedness to the extent of
such inclusion. Representative and its accountants and other advisors shall be
entitled to review the Closing Balance Sheet, the Parents Report, and any
working papers, trial balances and similar materials relating to the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Parents Report prepared by or on behalf of Parent
and/or its accountants as the Representative may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such access to the work papers of Parents
outside accountants shall be conditioned upon the Representatives execution
of customary indemnification and confidentiality agreements. The parties agree
that the amounts set forth on the Parents Report will be calculated in
accordance with the Accounting Principles. The parties further agree that the
calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital, Actual Closing Working
Capital, Estimated Closing Cash, Actual Closing Cash, Estimated Indebtedness
and Actual Indebtedness shall exclude any actions taken or changes made, or
caused to be taken or made, by Parent on the Closing Date after the Closing,
or any financing arrangements entered into by the Parent, which Parent causes
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to enter, at or after the
Closing.

2.7 _Disputes_. The following sets forth the procedures for resolving disputes
among the parties with respect to the determination of the Actual Closing
Working Capital, Actual Closing Cash, Actual Closing Indebtedness and/or
Actual Seller Transaction Expenses:

 

(a) Within thirty (30) days after delivery to Representative of the Parents
Report, Representative may deliver to Parent a written report (the "
_Representative s Report_") advising Parent either that Representative (i)
agrees with the calculation of the Actual Closing Working Capital, Actual
Closing Cash, Actual Closing Indebtedness, Actual Seller Transaction Expenses
and the adjustments to the Estimated Merger Consideration to arrive at the
Merger Consideration reflected in Parents Report (in which case such
calculations shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties and
shall not be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment), or (ii)
disagrees with any such calculation and believes that one or more adjustments
are required as a result of Parents calculations not being in accordance with
the Accounting Principles or having computational errors. The
Representatives report shall specify in reasonable detail each item of
Parents report to which such disagreement relates and the basis for each such
disagreement. Parent and its accountants and other advisors shall be entitled
to review the Representatives Report, and any working papers, trial balances
and similar materials relating to the Representatives Report prepared by or
on behalf of Representative and/or its accountants as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access to the work papers of
Representatives outside accountants shall be conditioned upon Parents
execution of customary indemnification and confidentiality agreements. If
Parent shall concur with the adjustments proposed in the Representatives
Report, or if Parent shall not object thereto in a writing delivered to
Representative within thirty (30) days after Parents receipt of the
Representatives Report, the calculation of the Actual Closing Working
Capital, Actual Closing Cash, Actual Closing Indebtedness and Actual Seller
Transaction Expenses and the adjustments to the Estimated Merger Consideration
to arrive at the Merger Consideration set forth in the Representatives
Report shall become final, conclusive and binding on the parties and shall not
be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment. If Representative does
not submit the Representatives Report within the 30-day period provided
herein, then the calculation of the Actual Closing Working Capital, Actual
Closing Cash, Actual Closing Indebtedness, Actual Seller Transaction 

 



11  Expenses and the adjustments to the Estimated Merger Consideration to arrive
at the Merger Consideration set forth in the Parents Report shall become
final, conclusive and binding on the parties and shall not be subject to
further review, challenge or adjustment.

(b) In the event that Representative submits the Representatives Report and
Parent objects by written notice as set forth in _Section 2.7(a)_, Parent and
Representative shall confer in good faith to attempt to resolve any
disagreements between the Parents Report and the Representatives Report. If
Parent and Representative are unable to resolve such disagreements within
thirty (30) days after the date of Parents written objection to the
Representatives Report, then such disagreements shall be referred to the
Miami, FL office of (i) PricewaterhouseCoopers or (ii) if that accounting firm
is unable or unwilling to serve, another recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants selected by mutual agreement of Representative
and Parent (the " _Settlement Accountants_ "). The Settlement Accountant shall
offer each of Parent and Representative the opportunity to provide written
submissions regarding their positions on the disputed matters (with respect
to which neither Representative nor Parent shall be bound by the Parents
Report, the Representatives Report, nor any objection thereto). The
Settlement Accountants shall make a determination solely based on the
provisions and definitions of this Agreement, including the Accounting
Principles, and such written submissions, and solely with respect to the items
that remain subject to disagreement. The Settlement Accountants shall deliver
a written report resolving only such disputed matters and setting forth the
basis for such resolution within thirty (30) days after Representative and
Parent submit in writing (or have had the opportunity to submit in writing but
have not submitted) their positions as to the disputed items. The Settlement
Accountants shall not assign a value to any disputed matter greater than the
greatest value for such matter claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value claimed for such matter by either party. The determinations of
the Settlement Accountants with respect to the Actual Closing Working Capital,
Actual Closing Cash, Actual Closing Indebtedness and Actual Seller Transaction
Expenses, and adjustments to the Estimated Merger Consideration to arrive at
the Merger Consideration as a result thereof, shall be final, conclusive and
binding and shall not be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment.
The Settlement Accountants shall use their best efforts to reach a
determination not more than forty-five (45) days after such referral.

(c) Each of Parent and Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) shall
pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this _Section
2.7_. The costs and expenses of the services of the Settlement Accountants
shall be paid by Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) if (i) the
absolute difference between (A) the sum of Actual Closing Working Capital,
Actual Closing Cash, Actual Closing Indebtedness and Actual Seller Transaction
Expenses resulting from the determination of the Settlement Accountants and
(B) the sum of Actual Closing Working Capital, Actual Closing Cash, Actual
Closing Indebtedness and Actual Seller Transaction Expenses reflected in the
Representatives Report is greater than (ii) the absolute difference between
(A) the sum of Actual Closing Working Capital, Actual Closing Cash, Actual
Closing Indebtedness and Actual Seller Transaction Expenses resulting from the
determinations of the Settlement Accountants and (B) the sum of Actual Closing
Working Capital, Actual Closing Cash, Actual Closing Indebtedness and Actual
Seller Transaction Expenses reflected in the Parents Report; otherwise, such
costs and expenses of the Settlement Accountants shall be paid by Parent.

 

2.8 _Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment_. If the Merger Consideration (as
finally determined in accordance with  _Section 2.7_) is less than the
Estimated Merger Consideration, then Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders and the Gain Share Recipients) and Parent shall cause the Escrow
Agent (i) to pay to Parent from the Working Capital Escrow Amount an amount
equal to the amount of such shortfall by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by Parent and (ii) pay to
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) all remaining amounts of
the Working Capital Escrow Amount (if any) _less_ the Gain Share Escrow
Percentage of such remaining amounts, which shall be paid to the Company for
further distribution to the applicable Gain Share Recipients, subject to
applicable withholding requirements, and subject to the payment of the
employer portion of any applicable payroll, employment or similar Taxes. If
the Merger Consideration (as finally determined in accordance with _Section
2.7_) is greater than the Estimated Merger Consideration, then (i) Parent
shall pay to Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) an amount equal to
the amount of

 



12  such excess _less_ the aggregate amount payable to or with respect to the
Gain Share Recipients of such remaining excess in accordance with the
methodology set forth on the Closing Funds Flow Statement (which shall be
paid to the Company for further distribution to the applicable Gain Share
Recipients, subject to applicable withholding requirements, and subject to the
payment of the employer portion of any applicable payroll, employment or
similar Taxes) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated by Representative and (ii) Parent and Representative
shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Representative (on behalf of
the Stockholders) the Working Capital Escrow Amount _less_ the Gain Share
Escrow Percentage of such remaining amounts, which shall be paid to the
Company for further distribution to the applicable Gain Share Recipients,
subject to applicable withholding requirements, and subject to the payment of
the employer portion of any applicable payroll, employment or similar Taxes.
Any payments (other than the aggregate amounts payable to or with respect to
the Gain Share Recipients) payable by Parent under this _Section 2.8_ shall
be deemed part of the Merger Consideration and treated as additional
Stockholder Proceeds, and Representative promptly shall disburse such
additional Stockholder Proceeds to each of the Stockholders  _pro rata_ as
additional Per Share Merger Consideration. Any payment pursuant to this
_Section 2.8_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements.
To avoid doubt, notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.7_ and _2.8_ ,
the Merger Consideration is subject to further adjustment as provided in
_Section 7.3_.

and safety, plant closings, mass layoffs and relocations. All employees and
former employees of Holding and the Operating Companies classified as exempt
under the Fair Labor Standards Act and state and local wage and hour Legal
Requirements have been properly classified as exempt.

(e) The Operating Companies and Holding are and since December 31, 2012, have
been in compliance in all material respects with applicable workers
compensation laws and have paid in full all amounts owing pursuant thereto and
there are no outstanding or pending assessments, levies or penalties
thereunder.

(f) _Schedule 3.7(f)_ hereto contains a true and complete listing, including
location and the amount paid each year, of each individual paid by the
Operating Companies as an independent contractor, rather than as an employee,
and who was paid in excess of $40,000 in any year during the period from
January 1, 2014 through the date of this Agreement (" _Independent
Contractors_ "). The Operating Companies have not completed Internal Revenue
Service (" _IRS_ ") Form SS-8 with respect to any Independent Contractor and
no Independent Contractor has completed IRS Form SS-8 with respect to the
Operating Companies. All Independent Contractors are and have been since
December 31, 2012, properly classified as independent contractors under
applicable Legal Requirements. Neither the Operating Companies nor Holding
has any worker treated as employee on its payroll who performs the same or
similar functions as any Independent Contractor. All of the Operating
Companies maintains good commercial relations with all of their
respective Independent Contractors and since December 31, 2015, no
Independent Contractor has canceled, terminated or made any threat to such
Operating Company to cancel or otherwise terminate his or her relationship
with such Operating Company

Companies has effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq. or any
similar state or applicable law (collectively, " _WARN Laws_ ") affecting
any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within
any site of employment or facility of the Operating Companies; (ii) a "mass
layoff" (as defined in the WARN Laws); or (iii) such other transaction,
layoff, reduction in force, reduction of hours, or employment terminations
sufficient in number to trigger any liability or notice requirement under any
WARN Laws.

 

(h) Neither Holding nor any of the Operating Companies has any obligation to
indemnify any Person for violation of any employment law or for the violation
of any restrictive covenant. To the Knowledge of Holding, no Independent
Contractor or employee of the Operating Companies is subject to any non-
compete, non-solicitation, nondisclosure, confidentiality, employment,
consulting or similar Contracts in conflict with the work such Independent
Contractor or employee performs for the Operating Companies. Since January 1,
2013, neither Holding nor any of the Operating Companies has received written
notice from any third party that any Person currently or formerly engaged or
employed by or affiliated with Holding or any of the Operating Companies (i)
has violated any of the terms or conditions of any employment, non-
competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure agreement that such Person
has entered with any third party, (ii) has disclosed or utilized any trade
secret or proprietary information or documentation of any third party, or
(iii) has interfered in the employment relationship between any third party

3.8 _Employee Plans_. _Schedule 3.8_ lists all Employee Plans.

(a) To the extent applicable with respect to each Employee Plan, true, correct
and complete copies of the most recent documents described below have been
delivered to Parent: (i) IRS determination letter and any outstanding request
for a determination letter; (ii) Form 5500 for the three most recent plan
years, including without limitation all schedules thereto; (iii) ruling
letter and any outstanding request for a ruling letter with respect to the
tax-exempt status of any VEBA which is funding or otherwise exists with
respect to such Employee Plan; (iv) in the case of an Employee Plan that is a
"group health plan" as defined in Code Section 5000(b)(1), general
notification to employees of their rights under Code Section 4980B, form of
letters distributed upon the occurrence of a qualifying event described
in Code Section 4980B, HIPAA policies and procedures and HIPAA notice of
privacy practices; (v) all plan documents and amendments thereto and any
written policies and/or procedures used in plan administration; (vi) current
summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications and insurance
certificates; (vii) administrative service agreements and HIPAA business
associate agreements; and (viii) related trust agreements, annuity contracts,
insurance contracts or other funding instruments that implement or govern
each Employee Plan.

(b) Each Employee Plan and related trust agreement, annuity contract or other
funding instrument is in compliance in all material respects with and has been
administered, operated, and maintained in compliance in all material respects
with its terms, ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Legal Requirements.
Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is the
subject of a favorable opinion letter from the IRS on the form of
such Employee Plan, and to Knowledge of Holding nothing has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
such Employee Plan. None of the Entities has direct or indirect material
liability with respect to any Employee Plan under the requirements provided
by any and all statutes, orders or governmental rules or regulations,
including but not limited to ERISA, COBRA, HIPAA and the Code. With respect to
each Employee Plan, no prohibited transactions (as defined in ERISA Section
406 or Code Section 4975) and no violations of ERISA Section 407 for which an
applicable statutory or administrative exemption does not exist have occurred
and which resulted or would result in material liability to any of the
Entities.

(c) None of the Entities nor their ERISA Affiliates has within the past six
(6) years contributed to (or been required to contribute to) sponsored or
participated in (i) any pension plan or defined benefit pension plan or any
other plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, (ii) any "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in section 3(37) of ERISA), (iii) any multiple employer plan (as
described in section 413(c) of

 



17  Code or section 210 of ERISA) or (iv) any "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" (as defined in section 3(40) of ERISA). None of the Entities has
any current or potential liability or obligation under Title IV of ERISA.
None of the Employee Plans provides for welfare benefits, and the Entities do
not otherwise provide or have liability or obligation to provide for life,
health or other welfare benefits to retired employees or to the beneficiaries
or dependents of retired employees other than as required by COBRA or similar
Legal Requirements.

(d) All of the Employee Plans are, and have been since their establishment,
duly registered where required by applicable Legal Requirements and are in
good standing thereunder (including registration with the relevant Tax
authorities where such registration is required to qualify for Tax exemption
or other beneficial Tax status), and all employer obligations in respect of
the Employee Plans (including the administration thereof), required under
applicable Legal Requirements and their terms have been satisfied and there
are no outstanding defaults or violations in respect thereof.

(e) Other than routine claims for benefits, no Employee Plan is subject to
any pending action, investigation, examination, claim (including claims for
Taxes) or any other proceeding initiated by any Person, and to the Knowledge
of Holding there exists no state of facts which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any such action, investigation, examination, claim or other
proceeding. No Employee Plan is the subject of an audit or other inquiry from
the IRS, U.S. Department of Labor, PBGC or other governmental entity. None of
the Entities or any Entity director, officer, employee or any plan fiduciary
has any material liability for failure to comply with ERISA, HIPAA, COBRA or
the Code for any action or failure to act in connection with the
administration or investment of any Employee Plan.

(f) All contributions to the Employee Plans required to have been made by the
terms of such plan or by applicable Legal Requirements have been made on a
timely basis in accordance with ERISA and the Code. No insurance policy or any
other agreement affecting any Employee Plan requires or permits a retroactive
increase in contributions, premiums or other payments due under such
insurance policy or agreement. The level of insurance reserves under each
insured Employee Plan is reasonable and sufficient to provide for all incurred
but unreported claims.

 

(g) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, no provision of any Employee
Plan or of any agreement, and no act or omission of any Entity, in any way
limits, impairs, modifies or otherwise affects its right to unilaterally amend
or terminate any Employee Plan, and no commitments to improve or otherwise
amend any Employee Plan have been made.

 

(h) No Employee Plan or other benefit arrangement covers any employee or
former employee outside of the United States, and the Entities have never
been obligated to contribute to any such plan.

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(i)_ , the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any
current or former employee, independent contractor or consultant of the
Entities to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of any
compensation due to any current or former employee, independent contractor, or
consultant of the Entities, or (iii) give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible pursuant to Code Section 280G.

(j) Each Employee Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation" plan
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been documented, operated
and administered in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of
the Code and other authoritative and binding guidance thereunder, and none of
the Entities has any (i) liability for taxes or penalties due under or with
respect to Code Section 409A or 4999 or (ii) indemnity obligation for any
Taxes imposed under Code Sections 409A or 4999.

 

(k) The Entities are and have been in material compliance with the Affordable
Care Act. The Entities have made an offer of affordable minimum essential
coverage to their respective

 



18  employees in the manner contemplated under Section 4980H of the Code to the
extent required to avoid the adverse tax consequences thereunder, and the
Entities are not otherwise liable or responsible for any assessable payment,
taxes or other penalties under Section 4980H of the Code or otherwise under
the Affordable Care Act or in connection with requirements relating thereto.

 

(l) All employee data necessary to administer each Employee Plan in accordance
with its terms and conditions and all Legal Requirements is in possession of
the Entities and such data is complete, correct, and in a form which is
sufficient for the proper administration of each Employee Plan.

similar agreement (whether written or oral) pursuant to which an Entity
granted to any Person the right of use or occupancy of any land or buildings
that have at any time been owned and/or occupied by such Entity but which are
no longer owned or occupied by such Entity.

(b) _Schedule 3.14(b)_ hereto sets forth a list of (i) all real property
leased, subleased, used or occupied by any Entity (" _Leased Premises_ "),
(ii) all Leased Premises, or portions thereof, that any Person subleases,
licenses or otherwise has been granted the right to use or occupy, (iii) a
complete and accurate list of each lease, sublease, license, occupancy or

estates in, or are granted the right to use or occupy, the Leased Premises,
and (B) have granted to any Person a sublease, license or any other right of

force and effect, and is enforceable by the applicable Entity and, to the
Knowledge of Holding, each other party thereto, in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by general equitable principles or
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws and judicial
decisions from time to time in effect, which affect creditors rights
generally. Each of the Entities has performed and observed all material
covenants, conditions and agreements required to be performed or observed by
it in respect of any of the Leased Premises, and no written notice of a

thereto.

contemplated by this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements. This Agreement
and each Collateral Agreement to which Representative is a party constitutes,

which affect creditors rights generally.

4.3 _No Default or Consents_. Neither the execution and delivery of this

with, any private non-governmental third party or any Governmental Authority,

Parents knowledge, threatened before any Governmental Authority seeking to
restrain Parent or MergerSub, or prohibit their entry into this Agreement or
prohibit the Closing, or seeking Damages against Parent or MergerSub or any
of their properties as a result of the consummation of this Agreement, which,
if determined adversely, would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent or MergerSub to enter into and
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

analysis, and the respective representations and warranties of Holding,
Representative and the Stockholders expressly set forth in this Agreement or
a Collateral Agreement or as and to the extent required by this Agreement to
be set forth in the Schedules referred to herein, and are assuming and relying
upon the absence of fraud, in entering into this Agreement and consummating
the transactions contemplated hereby and specifically disclaim that they are
relying upon or have relied upon any other representations and warranties that
may be alleged to have been made by Holding, Representative or any other

Agreement or as and to the extent required by this Agreement to be set forth

fraud, Parent and MergerSub acknowledge that should any of the representations
and warranties in this Agreement prove to be untrue, incomplete or incorrect,
then they shall have the specific rights and remedies specified in
this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements, which have been bargained for
at arms length, as the exclusive rights and remedies therefor, and that no
other rights, remedies or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, or
whether in law or equity) are permitted to Parent or MergerSub (or to any
other Person claiming through or on behalf of any of them) as a result of any
untrue, incomplete or incorrect representation and warranty.

that Parent is familiar with such uncertainties, that Parent takes full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to them
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts), and that Parent and MergerSub shall have no claim
against any Stockholder or any other Person with respect thereto, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement or a Collateral

 



37  Agreement, and assuming and relying upon the absence of fraud. Accordingly,

have not made any representations, warranties, promises, assurances or

violation of any Legal Requirements with respect to money laundering, anti-
terrorism or similar criminal laws.

(w) authorize, or commit or agree to take, any of the foregoing actions listed
in this  _Section 5.2_.

5.3 _Code Section 280G_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, Holding will identify each employee or other service
provider of the Entities who may become eligible to receive payments in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone
or in conjunction with another event) which, without regard to this
subsection, would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. Thereafter, Holding will use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly (a) obtain from each such employee or other
service provider a waiver of any "parachute payment" that is not approved by
the stockholders in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, and (b)
submit such amounts for stockholder approval in accordance with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code, in each case no later than
five Business Days before the Closing Date. Holding will provide Parent with
copies of the waiver and stockholder approval documents (including
the disclosure statement and back-up calculations) for Parents review,
comment and consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) within a reasonable period of time before submission
of such documents to employees, service providers, and stockholders, as
applicable, and will make such changes to the documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent in order to satisfy the stockholder approval exemption
from Section 280G of the Code. Holding will provide Parent with a copy of the
final waivers and stockholder approval documents that are submitted to
employees, service providers, and stockholders, with a certification that such
documents were timely submitted to employees, service providers, and
Stockholders prior to the Closing Date as provided in this section.

5.4 _Use of Cash_. The Entities may, at any time prior to the third (3rd)
Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, withdraw any cash and
cash equivalents from the bank and other deposit accounts of the Entities to
prepay Indebtedness ( _provided_ that in the event of any such prepayment, an
updated Indebtedness Pay-off Letter shall be required with respect thereto for
purposes of _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_) or to make distributions
to the Stockholders by transferring such cash to the Representative as agent
for the Stockholders. Parent and MergerSub acknowledge and agree that the
Merger is to be effected on a "cash-free" basis, and no such withdrawal of
cash from the Entities shall be a breach of any representation or warranty or
a violation of any covenant in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the parties agree to reasonably cooperate to ensure that $2,000,000 of cash
and cash equivalents remain in the bank and other deposit accounts of the
Entities to allow the Entities to operate in the Ordinary Course of Business
immediately following the Closing. Any such cash and cash equivalents that
remain in the bank and other deposit accounts of the Entities following the
Closing shall be assets for the purpose of the calculation of Working Capital.

5.5 _Notice Regarding Changes_.

(a) Holding shall promptly inform Parent in writing of any change in facts and

and warranties made herein by Holding inaccurate or misleading in any material
respect if such representations and warranties had been made upon the
occurrence of the fact or circumstance in question.

 

(b) Parent shall promptly inform Holding in writing of any change in facts and
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to render any of the
representations and warranties made herein by Parent inaccurate or misleading
in any material respect if such representations and warranties had been made
upon the occurrence of the fact or circumstance in question.

compensation in the Ordinary Course of Business. Without limiting the
foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, Holding shall have caused all

hereof under _Article III_ (the " _Supplement_ ") to reflect any fact
or condition occurring after the date hereof that would cause a breach of a
representation and warranty of Holding had such representation or warranty

terms of the applicable Parent Benefit Plan, recognize all service of the
Continuing Employees with the Operating Companies as if such service were with
Parent, for vesting and eligibility purposes in any Parent Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Closing Date; _provided, however_ , such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
or (y) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Employee Plan.
With respect to any employee welfare benefit plans maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates in which any Continuing Employees will participate effective as of

respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

(including Taxes imposed on the indirect transfer of any Subsidiary of
Holding pursuant to this Agreement), sales, use or similar Taxes applicable
to, imposed upon or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with the costs of preparing any related Tax Returns, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne 50% by the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders) and 50% by Parent. Parent shall timely file all Tax Returns
required in connection with any Transfer Taxes.

 

8.3 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all Tax Sharing Agreements between any
of the Entities, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other, shall

such agreement for any past or future period.

 

ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS

 

9.1 _Limitation on Liability_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of Holding, the Representative and
Parent set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing, for the periods
as expressly provided in _Section 9.1(b)_. The covenants and obligations
contained herein will survive the Closing to the extent necessary to give
effect to their respective terms.

 

(b) Stockholders shall have no liability to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parities pursuant to clause (i) of  _Section 7.3(a)_ with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_, _Section 3.2_,
_Section 3.3_, _Section 3.4_, _Section 3.5_, _Section 3.18(c)_,  _Section
3.23_, _Section 3.27_, _Section 3.32_ through _Section 3.35_ (collectively
the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), in each case unless Representative
receives notice in writing from a Parent Indemnified Party of such Parent
Indemnified Partys claim under said indemnity on or before the six (6) year
anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time the Fundamental Representations
shall expire. Stockholders shall have no liability to indemnify Parent
Indemnified Party pursuant to clause (i) of _Section 7.3(a)_ with respect to
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_, _Sections
3.6_ through  _Section 3.22_ (other than _Section 3.18(c)_), _Section
3.24_ through _Section 3.26_, _Section 3.28_ through _Section 3.31_
(collectively the " _Business Representations_ " and collectively with the
Fundamental Representations, the " _Representations_ "), in each case unless
Representative receives notice in writing from a Parent Indemnified Party of
such Parent Indemnified Partys claim under said indemnity on or before the
three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date, at which date the Business
Representations shall expire. Any notice shall specify the alleged
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant with
reasonable particularity, the sections of this Agreement alleged to have been
breached, a good faith estimate (if possible, and based on the information
available at that time) of the Damages claimed, and all relevant material
facts then known. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing limitations
shall not apply in the case of fraud; and, to avoid doubt, a Parent
Indemnified Party or a Stockholder Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
submit a claim for indemnification for reasonably anticipated Damages in
advance of the actual incurrence by any such persons of the same so long as
the underlying breach occurs prior to the

 



49  expiration of the applicable survival period, which claim, if submitted
prior to the expiration of an applicable survival period with regard to the
underlying matter, shall preserve such persons rights to continue to assert
such claim (and any Damages relating thereto) relating to the underlying
matter following the expiration of the otherwise applicable survival period
and shall preserve such persons rights in the Escrow Agreement or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such claim.

(c) For purposes of the indemnification contemplated by _Section 7.3(a)(i)_
hereof, all qualifications and exceptions contained in the _Article III_
representations and warranties relating to materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or words of similar impact (but not specific dollar thresholds) shall
be disregarded. However, Stockholders shall be obligated to indemnify as and
to the extent set forth in _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ of this Agreement with respect
to the Representations only if and to the extent the aggregate of all of
their Damages to which such indemnity obligations apply exceeds the
Deductible, whereupon indemnification shall be available to the Parent
Indemnified Parties for the aggregate amount of such losses under _Section
7.3(a)(i)_ up to a maximum amount equal to the Maximum Payment Amount;
_provided_ that the foregoing limitations shall not apply with respect to
breaches of the Fundamental Representations. From and after the Closing (but
subject to the provisions of this  _Section 9.1_), after Stockholders
payment of the Maximum Payment Amount as provided in the preceding sentence,
in the absence of fraud, any and all claims for indemnification under _Section
7.3(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of Representations shall be satisfied
solely by recovery under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy;
_provided_ that the foregoing limitations shall not apply with respect to
breaches of the Fundamental Representations. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else to the contrary contained herein, the Deductible shall apply to
all claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ with respect
to the representations and warranties set forth in  _Sections 3.5_ and
_3.34_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any amounts
payable by Stockholders for indemnification claims under _Section 7.3(a)(i)_
with respect to breaches of Representations shall be satisfied first from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount (and, to avoid doubt, the Gain Share Percentage of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be available for any amounts payable by
Stockholders for indemnification claims from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount). From and after the Closing, in the absence of fraud, the aggregate
amount of Damages that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Parties
under _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_ through _(vi) (inclusive)_ shall be an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration (as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.7_).

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Parent has obtained the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in _Article III_. Parents sole and
exclusive recourse for Representatives and/or the Stockholders
indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ with respect to
Damages in excess of the Maximum Payment Amount shall be limited to filing a
claim under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, except with
respect to breaches of Fundamental Representations and except in the case of
fraud. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
PARENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OF ITS
AFFILIATES, THAT, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF FUNDAMENTAL
REPRESENTATIONS AND IN THE CASE OF FRAUD , HOLDING AND REPRESENTATIVE SHALL
NOT HAVE ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LIABILITY (DERIVATIVELY OR OTHERWISE) WITH
RESPECT TO ANY BREACH OR INACCURACY OF ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY SET
FORTH IN ARTICLE III OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE MAXIMUM
PAYMENT AMOUNT. PARENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF
AND EACH OF ITS AFFILIATES, THAT EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF FRAUD, PARENTS ONLY
RECOURSE IN THE EVENT OF ANY BREACH OR INACCURACY OF ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III OF THIS AGREEMENT OTHER THAN THE FUNDAMENTAL
REPRESENTATIONS, IF THE MAXIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT SHALL HAVE BEEN PAID
BY REPRESENTATIVE, SHALL BE TO FILE A CLAIM UNDER THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES INSURANCE POLICY. The provisions of this _Section 9.1_, including
the limited remedies provided herein, were specifically bargained-for by the
parties to this Agreement, and were taken into account by the parties in
arriving at the amount of the Merger Consideration. Holding and Representative
expressly have relied upon the provisions of this _Section 9.1_, including
the limited remedies provided herein, together with the provisions of
_Section 4.7_, in agreeing to accept the Merger Consideration and in agreeing
to provide the specific representations and warranties set forth in _Article
III_ of this Agreement.

 



50 (e) From and after the Closing, and subject to _Section 7.4(b)_ and the
rights of Parent under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy,
and in the absence of fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy of each party with
respect to any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement shall be pursuant (and only pursuant) to the indemnification
provisions set forth in _Section 7.3_, _Article VIII_ and this _Section 9.1_
and in the Stockholder Support Agreements; _provided_ that notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 9.1(e)_, each party shall be entitled to seek
specific performance and injunctive relief in connection with any breach or
threatened breach of a covenant or agreement herein, and (ii) to avoid doubt,
none of the limitations set forth in _Section 9.1(c)_ shall be applicable to
claims for indemnification other than pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_.

 

(f) In the event that Parent seeks indemnification on behalf of a Parent
Indemnified Party, or the Representative seeks indemnification on behalf of a
Stockholder Indemnified Party, such party seeking indemnification (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall give reasonably prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") specifying the facts
constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of
the claim asserted; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right of a person to be
indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give
such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party
is actually and materially damaged thereby. Subject to the terms hereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a notice
pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(f)_, either pay the amount of any valid claim
or deliver written notice to the Indemnified Party disputing such claim in
whole or in part; _provided_ , _however_ , the failure of the Indemnifying
Party to deliver a written notice disputing such claim within the thirty (30)
day period shall be deemed as a dispute of such claim in its entirety. In
cases where the Indemnifying Party disputes a claim hereunder, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly consult with the Indemnifying Party in an effort to
resolve the dispute. If any such dispute cannot be resolved by the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party within thirty (30) days, the Indemnified
Party may seek to enforce its rights under  _Section 7.3_ and this _Section
9.1_ as set forth in this Agreement. For purposes of _Section 7.3_ and this
_Section 9.1_, the Representative has the full, and sole and exclusive,
authority to act, and shall act, on behalf of the Representative, the
Stockholders and any Stockholder Indemnified Person as either an Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party, and a notification to the Representative shall
be deemed to constitute a notification of each Stockholder.

(g) If any third party shall notify in writing any Indemnified Party with
respect to the assertion by such third party or any other person not a party
hereto of a claim or commencement of any proceeding (a " _Third Party Claim_
") that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for
indemnification against any Indemnifying Party under  _Section 7.3_, then
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably promptly notify each Indemnifying Party
thereof in writing; _provided_ that the failure of an Indemnified Party to
give the Indemnifying Party such notice within such time period shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this
Agreement except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure.

 

(h) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to litigate, contest and defend
the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party (and, subject to
_Section 9.1(i)_ hereof, negotiate and settle such Third Party Claim) so long
as (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing by
delivering an unconditional acknowledgement, within thirty (30) days after the
Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim, that the
Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any
and all Damages the Indemnified Party suffers or could reasonably be expected
to suffer resulting from or arising out of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the
Third Party Claim does not seek a temporary restraining order, a preliminary
or permanent injunction or specific performance against the Indemnified Party
or involve criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party, (iii)
settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party, or to exceed the
amount to which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification
hereunder by more than 50% of such amount, and (iv) the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently. In the
event that

 



51  the Indemnifying Party does not elect (within the requisite thirty (30) day
period) to, or does not have the right to, control the defense and settlement
of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, (i)
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have the control over said defense
and settlement of the subject claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party will
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnified Party such assistance
and materials as it may reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense assisted by
counsel of its own choosing, and the Indemnifying Party, if it is required to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, will be liable for all costs and
settlement amounts paid or incurred in connection therewith.

 

(i) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with the first sentence of  _Section 9.1(h)_
above, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole
cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii)
the Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably),
and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
withheld unreasonably, it being agreed that it would be unreasonable to
withhold consent to a settlement pursuant to which (x) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any
person, or finding of responsibility or liability on the part of the
Indemnified Party, or obligation of the Indemnified Party for any damages or
other amount (other than monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party), or any Lien on any property of the Indemnified Party, or
any sanction or injunction of, restriction upon the conduct of any business
by, or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party and (y) the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party.

 

(j) Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to a breach
of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement if and to the
extent that the Damages incurred or to be incurred by the Parent Indemnified
Parties arising out of or resulting from or related to such breach were
actually taken into account in, included in or resolved by or as part of
the determination of the Merger Consideration (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section 2.7_) (in each such case, as evidenced by written
communications exchanged between Parent and the Representative or their
respective accountants, or the Settlement Accountants). To the extent
required under applicable law, each Indemnified Party will use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate any Damages which it or any other
Indemnified Party may suffer in consequence of any fact, matter or
circumstance giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement
or likely to give rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(k) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Parent or its Representatives, of Holding, any Subsidiary of Holding, or any
of their respective businesses, assets, liabilities or otherwise, shall in any
way limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim for
indemnification or other claim by Parent or any Parent Indemnified Party under
this Agreement.

(l) Neither the Representative nor any Stockholder shall have any claim for
contribution from or against the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of any indemnification or other payments made to any
Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to
any indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(vi)_, (i) the Stockholders
shall have no liability to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party with respect
thereto unless a claim is brought against the Company for additional amounts
owed in connection with the termination of the Contract set forth on
_Schedule 3.15(c)_ and the Representative receives notice thereof in writing
from Parent of such claim on or before the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, (ii) the aggregate amount of all Damages for which
the Stockholders shall be liable shall not exceed $330,000 and (iii) the
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to control, and the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of any
such claim.

 



52 9.2 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of the parties shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and their respective employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel
and other representatives and advisers to, hold in strict confidence all, and
not divulge or disclose any, information of any kind concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or Holding, or their respective
businesses;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing obligation of
confidence shall not apply to (i) information that is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by any
Stockholder, any party hereto, any of their respective Affiliates, or any of
their respective employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel or other
representatives or advisers, (ii) information disclosed in connection with a
partys enforcement of its rights hereunder, and (iii) information that is
required to be disclosed by Parent, any of its Affiliates, or any of their
respective employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel or other
representatives or advisers as a result of any applicable Legal Requirement
(including the requirements of any stock exchange), _provided_ that Parent
shall promptly notify Holding and Representative of any disclosure pursuant to
clause (iii) of this _Section 9.2_. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms. If the Closing occurs in accordance with
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be terminated at the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to comply with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(3), the parties hereto may disclose
to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the federal tax
treatment and tax structure of any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) After the Closing, Representative shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates and its and their respective representatives to hold in strict
confidence all, and not divulge or disclose any, or use any, confidential
documents or information concerning the Entities or the Business; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing obligation of confidence shall not apply to:
(i) information that is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure by any Stockholder, or the Representative, or
any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their respective employees,
agents, accountants, legal counsel or other representatives or advisers, (ii)
information disclosed in connection with Representatives enforcement of its
rights hereunder, and (iii) information that is required to be disclosed by
Representative, any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective employees,
agents, accountants, legal counsel or other representatives or advisers as a
result of any applicable Legal Requirement (including the requirements of any
stock exchange), _provided_ that Representative shall promptly notify Parent
of any disclosure pursuant to clause (iii) of this _Section 9.2(b)_.

 

9.3 _Brokers_. Regardless of whether the Closing shall occur, (i) Fund V shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent from and against any and all liability for
any brokers or finders fees arising with respect to brokers or finders
retained or engaged by or on behalf of Fund V or its Affiliate in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless Fund V from and against any and all liability for
any brokers or finders fees arising with respect to brokers or finders
retained or engaged by or on behalf of Parent or its Affiliate in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. _Section 9.3_ shall survive
termination of the Agreement.

9.4  _Costs and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein,
each of the parties to this Agreement shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and closing of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall be responsible the full amount of the Representations
and Warranties Policy Fees, and the Stockholders (and the Representative, on
behalf of the Stockholders), and not Parent, Holding or any other Entity,
shall be responsible for the full amount of any Seller Transaction Expenses.

 



53 9.5 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other
document to be given hereunder by any party hereto to another (herein
collectively called " _Notice_ ") shall be in writing and delivered
personally; mailed by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return
receipt requested; delivered by nationally or internationally recognized

(a) The provisions of this Agreement and the documents delivered pursuant
hereto and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, or

this Agreement, including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out
of or related to any representation or warranty made in or alleged to be made
in 

 



54  connection with this Agreement or allegedly made as an inducement to enter

accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF

OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT
OR OTHERWISE). EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE

this Agreement in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York, or, if under applicable legal requirements exclusive

9.7 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements, together with all exhibits and schedules attached
hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between and among the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
parties (including any confidentiality agreement and/or letter of intent), and
there are no warranties, representations, promises, assurances, guaranties,
or other agreements between the parties in connection with the subject matter
hereof except as set forth specifically herein or expressly contemplated
hereby. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only
in writing signed by Parent, MergerSub, Holding and the Representative;
provided, however, that the provisions specifically relating to the Financing
Sources set forth in _Sections 2.5(b)(ii)_ , _5.12_ , _9.6_ , _9.8_ and _9.14_
 and this _Section 9.7_ may not be amended in a manner materially adverse to
the Financing Sources without the written consent of the Financing Sources. No
waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision
hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

9.8 _Binding Effect and Assignment_ ; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns; but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party hereto, other than
for collateral purposes, without the prior written consent of the other
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have the right to transfer
and assign any of its rights, benefits or obligations hereunder to any entity
which is controlled directly or indirectly by Parent. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall grant to or confer, or is intended to
grant to or confer, upon any Person (other than the parties hereto) any
rights, benefits or

 



55  obligations hereunder, and the parties agree that no provision of this
Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or
organization (including without limitation employees or former employees of
any Entity, unions or other representatives of such employees or former
employees, or trustees, administrators, participants, or beneficiaries of any
Employee Plan), and nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement; _provided_ that each Stockholder is an express third party
beneficiary of the provisions set forth in _Section 4.7_ and the
Parent Indemnified Parties and Stockholder Indemnified Parties are express
third party beneficiaries of _Section 7.3_ to the extent provided therein;
_provided_ , _further_ , that each of the Financing Sources is an express
third party beneficiary of the provisions of _Sections 2.5(b)(ii)_ , _5.12_ ,
_9.6_ , _9.7_ and _9.14_ and this _Section 9.8_.

 

9.9 _Waiver of Legal Conflict; Non-Assertion of Attorney-Client Privilege._

 

(a) Parent waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause Surviving
Corporation and Entities to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest
arising out of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the "
_Post-Closing Representation_ "), of any of Representative, Stockholders and
their respective Affiliates and any director, officer or employee of any
of the foregoing (individually and collectively, " _Seller Group_ ") in any
matter involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby, by any legal counsel (including Greenberg Traurig, P.A.
and David Gershman) currently representing Seller Group in connection with
this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
(such legal counsel, " _Existing Counsel_ " and such representation, the "
_Current Representation_ ").

(b) Parent waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause Surviving

FORM OF STOCKHOLDER SUPPORT AGREEMENT

STOCKHOLDER SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This STOCKHOLDER SUPPORT AGREEMENT, dated as of [●], 2016 (this " _Agreement_
"), is by and among Handstands Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Holding_ "), Trivest Partners V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, as
representative (" _Representative_ "), Energizer Holdings, Inc., a Missouri
corporation (" _Parent_ "), and the undersigned holders of capital stock of
Holding set forth on the signature pages hereto (each, a " _Supporting
Stockholder_ ").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Holding has determined it is in the best
interests of the stockholders of Holding for Holding to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise
modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which
Energizer Reliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent, will merge with and into Holding (the " _Merger_ "), with Holding
surviving as a subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, each Supporting Stockholder holds of record and owns the shares of
Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Holding (including any change in
such shares by reason of any stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization,
combination, conversion of securities, exchange of shares or the like, "
_Common Stock_ ") as set forth below such Supporting Stockholders name on
such Supporting Stockholders signature page hereto (the " _Owned Shares_ "
and the Owned Shares and any additional shares of Common Stock or other voting
securities of Holding of which such Supporting Stockholder acquires record or
beneficial ownership after the date hereof, including by purchase, as a result
of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination,
reclassification, exchange or change of such shares, or upon exercise or
conversion of any securities, such Stockholders " _Covered Shares_ "); and

WHEREAS, as a condition to Parents obligations to consummation the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Parent, Holding and
Representative desire that each Supporting Stockholder agree, and each
Supporting Stockholder is willing to agree, to enter into this Agreement. In
addition to the terms defined elsewhere herein, capitalized terms used and not
defined herein have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Holding, Representative, and each Supporting Stockholder,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

(1) _Voting of Holding Stock_. Each Supporting Stockholder hereby agrees to,
and hereby irrevocably consents, without a meeting and without prior notice,
pursuant to Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), to the adoption hereof, of the resolutions set
forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Written Consent_ "). Each Supporting
Stockholder irrevocably agrees not to vote or cause or permit to be voted, the
Covered Shares, or consent to any action by written consent, in any manner (i)
contrary to the Written Consent or (ii) in favor of any other action,
agreement or proposal that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone, frustrate, prevent, nullify or adversely affect the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

(2) _Treatment Under Merger Agreement_. Each Supporting Stockholder
acknowledges and agrees to the treatment, payments, terms and conditions
applicable to the Common Stock under the Merger Agreement, including, without
limitation, _Article I_ and _Article II_ of the Merger Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Supporting Stockholder agrees that, following
payment by Parent of the amounts required to be paid by Parent to the
Representative and other Persons in accordance with _Section 1.8_ of the
Merger Agreement, such Supporting Stockholder shall have no claim against
Holding or any other Person for Merger Consideration or any other
consideration in connection with any Common Stock owned by such Supporting
Stockholder, and such Supporting Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that such
Supporting Stockholder shall look and have recourse solely to Representative
for payment of any amounts due to such Supporting Stockholder pursuant to the
Merger Agreement or as a result of the Merger, including with respect to any
Gain Share Payment to which such Supporting Stockholder is entitled. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Supporting  Stockholder agrees that, to the extent that such Supporting Stockholder is
the debtor pursuant to any loan extended by any of the Entities, as
contemplated by Section 1.8 of the Merger Agreement, such loans (including
any interest or other amounts payable to any of the Entities with respect
thereto) shall be repaid out of the proceeds that such Supporting Stockholder
is otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement as a
Supporting Stockholder.

(3) _Grant of Proxy; Appointment of Proxy_.

 

(a) Each Supporting Stockholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints,
Representative as proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of
substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such Supporting
Stockholder, to vote all Covered Shares owned by such Supporting Stockholder
that are entitled to vote (whether pursuant to the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Holding, any contract or applicable law), or grant
a consent or approval in respect of such Covered Shares, including the Written
Consent (to the extent such Written Consent is not executed by the Supporting
Stockholder), or execute such other documents, in each case in order to
approve and effectuate the Merger Agreement and all transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. Each Supporting Stockholder hereby ratifies and
approves each and every action taken, decision made or instruction given by
such proxy and attorney-in-fact pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1_
hereof and this _Section 3_. Each Supporting Stockholder will take such
further action or execute such other instruments as may be necessary to
effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any proxy previously
granted by such Stockholder with respect to the Covered Shares (such
Supporting Stockholder hereby representing to Parent that any such proxy is
not irrevocable).

(b) Each Supporting Stockholder understands and acknowledges that the Merger
Agreement is being entered into by the parties thereto, including Parent, in
reliance upon the irrevocable proxy set forth in _Subsection 3(a)_ hereof.
Each Supporting Stockholder hereby affirms (i) that the irrevocable proxy set
forth in _Subsection 3(a)_ hereof is given to secure the performance of the
duties of such Supporting Stockholder under _Section 1_ of this Agreement and
(ii) that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and may under no
circumstances be revoked. Such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to
be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 212 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Representative shall have
no authority to vote the Common Stock with respect to the consent or approval
of any payment that could constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code.

 

(4) _Representative_.

 

(a) Each Supporting Stockholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints,
Representative as its representative, agent and attorney-in-fact (with full
power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such
Supporting Stockholder, with the same effect as if taken by such Supporting
Stockholder, with full power and authority to take any and all actions
and execute any and all documents and agreements in such Supporting
Stockholders name, place and stead and on its behalf, with the same effect as
if such action were taken or such document or agreement were executed by such
Supporting Stockholder, in connection with any matter or thing relating to
the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Collateral Agreements and any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the power
and authority to (i) institute, make or pursue claims, counterclaims or
defenses, (ii) enter into, modify, amend, implement or waive any contracts,
including the Merger Agreement and the Collateral Agreements, (iii)
compromise, surrender or settle any disputes or claims or make any other
determination or take any other action or assert or compromise any claim
relating to the Merger Agreement, the Collateral Agreements and any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including any adjustments in connection
with the determination of the Actual Closing Working Capital, Actual Closing
Cash, Actual Closing Indebtedness and Actual Seller Transaction

receive and deliver at the Closing certificates and other documents, (v) give
and receive notices by and on behalf of such Supporting Stockholder, (vi)
enter into amendments of the Merger Agreement and the Collateral Agreements;
provided, that Representative will not, as a result of such appointment, be
granted the power and authority to take any action or enter into any
agreement that (x) agrees or subjects any Supporting Stockholder to personal
liability for claims or other liabilities, except as expressly provided
herein, or (y) changes or modifies the ownership percentage in Holding (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of such Supporting Stockholder, and
(vii) receive service of process in connection with any claims under the
Merger Agreement.

 

(b) Representative hereby accepts its appointment as "Representative"
hereunder.

 

(c) Representative cannot be removed by the Supporting Stockholders or
Holding, respectively, except upon delivery to Representative of a written
instrument signed by Supporting Stockholders having a majority of the
ownership percentage in Holding. Representative may resign for any reason or
no reason, at any time. If Representative resigns or is so removed, then
a replacement Representative shall be designated by the Supporting
Stockholders (or their successors-in-interest) having a majority of the
ownership percentage in Holding. Any such replacement Representative will have
the full power and authority of Representative hereunder.

(d) Any Person (including Parent and Merger Sub) shall be entitled to rely,
without any investigation or inquiry by such Person, upon all actions,
notices, communications and determinations by Representative on behalf of the
Supporting Stockholders as having been taken upon the authority of the
Supporting Stockholders. Any actions, notices, communications and
determinations by Representative taken on behalf of the Supporting
Stockholders shall be conclusively deemed to be the actions, notices,
communications and determinations of the Supporting Stockholders.

 

(e) Neither Representative nor any of its officers, employees, agents,
partners, representatives or Affiliates will have any liability to Holding or
the Supporting Stockholders with respect to actions taken or omitted to be
taken by Representative in such capacity (or any of its employees, agents,
representatives or Affiliates in connection therewith), except with
respect to Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Representative, its officers, employees, agents, partners, representatives and
Affiliates shall be entitled to full reimbursement from the Supporting
Stockholders for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by Representative in such capacity (or any of its
officers, employees, agents, partners, representatives or Affiliates in
connection therewith), and to full indemnification by the Supporting
Stockholders (pro rata to their interests) against any Losses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Representative (except
for those arising out of Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including, without limitation, the costs and expenses of
investigation and defense of claims (including, without limitation, from funds
received by it in its capacity as Representative or funds to be distributed
to the Supporting Stockholders under the Merger Agreement at its direction).
In furtherance of the foregoing indemnification, the Supporting Stockholders
agree that Representative shall have the power and authority to set aside and
retain additional funds paid to or received by it, or direct payment of
additional funds to be paid to the Supporting Stockholders, as Merger
Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement at Closing or thereafter to
satisfy such obligations (including to establish such reserves as
Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for such costs and
expenses whether or not then known or determinable).

 

(f) Representative shall have no duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement and Collateral
Agreements. Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts
and other agents and consultants as it shall deem appropriate in connection
with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and shall
be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons.
Representative

 



\- 3 -  may rely on any notice, instruction, certificate, statement, request,
consent, confirmation, agreement or other instrument which it reasonably
believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by a proper
person or persons.

(g) The relationship created herein is not to be construed as a joint venture
or any form of partnership between or among Representative or any Supporting
Stockholder for any purpose of federal or state law, including without
limitation, federal or state income tax purposes. Neither Representative nor
any of its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other duty to any Supporting
Stockholder. Each Supporting Stockholder acknowledges that it understands that
Representative and its Affiliates have a direct and/or indirect financial
interest in the Merger, including by virtue of its ownership of shares of
Common Stock of Holding and by virtue of fees that will be payable to
Representative in connection with the Merger pursuant to that certain
Management Agreement, dated May 1, 2013, executed by Representative, Holding,
and Company.

(5) _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Representative any direct ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to the shares of Common Stock owned by Supporting
Stockholders. Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, all
rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the shares
of Common Stock shall remain vested in and belong to the Supporting
Stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
_Section 5_ shall be construed to limit the ability of Representative to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant to
the authority granted hereunder.

(6) _Representations and Warranties of Supporting Stockholders_. Each
Supporting Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with,
Parent, Representative and Holding as follows:

 

(a) (i) The Owned Shares are owned by such Supporting Stockholder, free and
clear of any and all Liens (other than (x) restrictions on transfer arising
under applicable Securities Laws and (y) restrictions on transfer under any
stockholder or similar agreement that such Supporting Stockholder is a party
to that will terminate as of the Closing pursuant to this Agreement
(a "Terminating Stockholder Agreement")), and, as of the Closing, will be
owned by such Supporting Stockholder, free and clear of any and all Liens
(other than (x) restrictions on transfer arising under applicable Securities
Laws and (y) restrictions on transfer under any stockholder agreement that
such Supporting Stockholder is a party to that will terminate as of the
Closing pursuant to this Agreement).

 

(ii) Other than as provided in this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, any
Terminating Stockholder Agreement, (A) there are no options, warrants,
rights, subscriptions, convertible or exchangeable securities or other
agreements or commitments obligating such Supporting Stockholder to transfer,
sell, purchase, return or redeem, or cause the issuance, transfer,
sale, return or redemption of the Owned Shares and (B) there are no voting
trusts, proxies or other agreements to which such Supporting Stockholder is a
party with respect to the voting or transfer of capital stock of Holding. The

beneficially by such Supporting Stockholder.

 

(iii) Such Supporting Stockholder has voting power, power of disposition, sole
power to demand appraisal or dissenter rights, if any, and sole power to

restrictions on such rights, subject to applicable Securities Laws and the

Stockholder are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by such
Supporting Stockholder of this Agreement, the performance by such Supporting
Stockholder of its obligations hereunder or the consummation by such
Supporting Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Supporting
Stockholder, enforceable against such Supporting Stockholder in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable

organizational or governing documents (if applicable), (b) require any filing
with, notice to or the obtaining of any permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any Person, (c) violate, conflict with, or result in a default

any Law, order, injunction or decree applicable to such Supporting
Stockholder.

than is set forth in, any disclosure filed or furnished by Parent with or to
the Securities and Exchange Commission or (ii) in form and substance approved
in advance by Parent) to its investors, employees, accountants, advisors
and other representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary
conduct of its business (so long as such Persons agree to or are

 



\- 5 -  bound by contract to keep the terms of the Merger confidential). The
Supporting Stockholder further agrees to keep, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors

Supporting Stockholder or any of its Stockholder Representatives in violation
of this Section 7(d), or (ii) which is required to be disclosed by applicable
Law.

(8)  _Termination_. This Agreement and the covenants and agreements contained

Supporting Stockholder has received its _pro rata_ share of the Escrow Amount
in full).

 

(10) _Release of Claims_.

 

(a) Each Supporting Stockholder and each Guarantor, in each case on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, directors, officers, agents, trustees,
beneficiaries, heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns (each a "
_Releasor_ "), hereby relieves, releases, acquits and forever discharges
Representative, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and agrees that
Representative hereunder is hereby relieved, released, acquitted and
discharged to the fullest extent permitted by law, from any and all liability
(except for any liability arising out of Representatives gross negligence
or willful misconduct) to such Releasor for any decision, act, consent or
instruction of Representative hereunder or under the Merger Agreement or any
Collateral Agreement and each Supporting Stockholder and Guarantor agrees not
to make any claim or initiate any legal action inconsistent herewith. Each
Supporting Stockholder hereby additionally acknowledges and agrees that a
decision, act, consent or instruction of Representative relating to the Merger
Agreement, any Collateral Agreement and/or any ancillary documents hereto or
thereto shall constitute a decision for such Supporting Stockholder, and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon such Supporting Stockholder.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Supporting Stockholder and each and
Guarantor, in each case on behalf of itself and the other Releasors, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally relieves, releases, acquits and forever
discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Entities,
Parent, MergerSub and each of their respective past, present or
future officers, managers, directors, shareholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, employees,

 



\- 6 -  counsel and agents (each a " _Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and all
actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts,
liabilities, obligations, dues and suits of every kind, nature and
description whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
contingent or otherwise, both at law and in equity, whether sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise, which such Releasor or its heirs,
legal representatives, successors or assigns ever had, now has or may have on
or by reason of any action, event, circumstance, omission, matter or thing
whatsoever occurring or existing on or prior to the Closing Date against any
Releasee (collectively " _Released Claims_ "). Each Releasor agrees not to,
and agrees to cause its respective Affiliates and subsidiaries not to, assert
any Released Claim against the Releasees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Releasor and its respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns retain, and do not release, and Released Claims do not include, their
rights and interests (i) under the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) with
respect to a Supporting Stockholder or Guarantor who is an employee of
Holding or any of the Entities, such Supporting Stockholders or Guarantors
rights, if any, with respect to any accrued and unpaid salary or bonus due to
such Supporting Stockholder or Guarantor through the date hereof, vested
employee benefits as of the date hereof, and business expenses incurred prior
to the date hereof.

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, each Supporting Stockholder and each
Guarantor, in each case on behalf of itself and the other Releasors, hereby
agrees that he, she or it shall not make any claim for indemnification against
any Releasee by reason of the fact that such Supporting Stockholder or
Guarantor is or was a stockholder of Holding (whether such claim is for
judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement,
losses, expenses or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any
statute, charter document, bylaw, agreement or otherwise) with respect to any
action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim or demand brought against such
Supporting Stockholder or Guarantor, and such Supporting Stockholder
or Guarantor, on behalf of itself and the other Releasors, hereby
acknowledges and agrees that he, she or it shall not have any claim or right
to contribution or indemnity from any Releasee with respect to any amounts
paid by he, she or it pursuant to this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

(d) Each Supporting Stockholder and each Guarantor, in each case on behalf
of itself and the other Releasors, represents, warrants, acknowledges and
agrees that he, she or it has read this release and understands its terms and
has been given an opportunity to ask questions of Holdings, Parent and the
Representative and, in signing this release, such Supporting Stockholder or
Guarantor does not rely, and has not relied, on any representation or
statement not set forth in this release made by any representative of Holding,
Parent or the Representative or anyone else with regard to the subject
matter, basis or effect of this release.

(e) Each Supporting Stockholder and each Guarantor, in each case on behalf of
itself and the other Releasors, acknowledges that he, she or it, is familiar
with Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California ("Section
1542"), which provides as follows: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO
CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER
FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST
HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. Each
Supporting Stockholder and each Guarantor, hereby waives and relinquishes, in
each case on behalf of itself and the other Releasors, any rights and benefits
that such Supporting Stockholders or Guarantor, or Releasors, may have under
Section 1542 or any similar statutory or common law principle of any
jurisdiction. Each Supporting Stockholder and each Guarantor acknowledges that
such Supporting Stockholder or Guarnator may hereafter discover facts in
addition to or different from those that such Supporting Stockholder or
Guarantor now knows or believes to be true with respect to the subject matter
of this release, but it is such Supporting Stockholders or Guarantors
intention to fully and finally and forever settle and release all Released
Claims. In furtherance of the foregoing, the releases contained herein shall
be and remain in effect as full and complete general releases notwithstanding
the discovery or existence of any such additional or different facts.

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

HANDSTANDS HOLDING CORPORATION



FIRST: The name of the corporation is Handstands Holding Corporation (the "
_Corporation_ ").

SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is
located at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New
Castle County, Delaware 19801. The name of its registered agent at such
address is The Corporation Trust Company.

 

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended from time to
time, the " _DGCL_ ").

FOURTH: The Corporation shall be authorized to issue 2,000 shares of capital
stock, all of which shall be shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value (the "
_Common Stock_ ").

 

FIFTH: All corporate powers of the Corporation shall be exercised by or under
the direction of the board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ")
except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, the Board is expressly
authorized:

 

(i) to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the right
of the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect thereto
to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws made by the Board; and

(ii) from time to time to determine whether and to what extent, at what time
and place, and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books of
the Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of any
stockholder; and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any account
or book or document of the Corporation except as provided by applicable law or
the Bylaws of the Corporation or as authorized by resolution of the
stockholders or the Board.

 

SIXTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach
of fiduciary duty by such director as a director, except to the extent such
exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the
DGCL, as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended from time to time. If
the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. This provision is not intended to
eliminate or narrow any defenses to or protection against liability otherwise
available to directors of the Corporation. No amendment to or repeal of this
Article shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged
liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts
or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment. SEVENTH:

 

A. Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or
is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that such person or a person of whom such person is a legal
representative is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation or for its benefit as a director,
officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, or as the representative
of the Corporation in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity
(hereinafter, an " _indemnitee_ "), shall be (and shall be deemed to have a
contractual right to be) indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation (and
any successor to the Corporation by merger or otherwise) to the fullest extent
authorized by the DGCL, against all expenses, liabilities and losses
(including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) paid or incurred by such person in
connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall
inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.

 

B. To the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, each indemnitee shall have
(and shall be deemed to have a contractual right to have) the right to be
paid by the Corporation (and any successor to the Corporation by merger or
otherwise) the expenses incurred in defending any such action, suit or
proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if ultimately it should
be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation under the DGCL.

 

C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for proceedings to enforce any
officers or directors rights to indemnification or any directors rights to
advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify
any indemnitee, or advance expenses of any indemnitee (or such persons heirs,
executors or administrators) in connection with any proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board.

D. The Board may adopt bylaws from time to time with respect to
indemnification to provide at all times the fullest indemnification permitted
by the DGCL. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses
conferred in this Article Seventh shall neither be exclusive of, nor be
deemed in limitation of, any rights to which any person may otherwise be or
become entitled or permitted under this Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

E. To the fullest extent authorized or permitted by the DGCL, the Corporation
may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any current or former
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or person who is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by
such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as
such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such liability under the DGCL.

 



2 F. This Article Seventh shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance
expenses to, or to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of, persons other
than indemnitees or to advance expenses to persons other than directors of the
Corporation.

 

G. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision contained in Article
Seventh shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except
to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to
further limit or eliminate the liability of directors or officers) and shall
not adversely affect any right or protection of any current or former director
or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal
or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such
amendment, repeal or modification.

 

EIGHTH: To the maximum extent permitted by law, in the event that either the
Corporation or any stockholder of the Corporation acquires knowledge of any
potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter which may be an
opportunity for both the Corporation and such stockholder, neither the
Corporation nor such stockholder will have any duty to communicate or offer
such opportunity to the other and such stockholder will not be liable to the
Corporation for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a stockholder or
otherwise, and the Corporation will not be liable to such stockholder, by
reason of the fact that the Corporation or such stockholder, as the case may
be, pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself or does not communicate
such opportunity or information regarding such opportunity to such stockholder
or the Corporation, as the case may be.

 

NINTH: If any provision or provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any
circumstance for any reason whatsoever the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including, without
limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of
Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

 

TENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders, directors and officers herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Instruction instructing the Escrow
Agent to release to Parent from the Escrow Property the Indemnity Claim
Amount.

 

(ii) In the event that any Indemnity Claim Amount is determined pursuant to
the dispute resolution provisions of the Merger Agreement including, as
applicable a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a final
arbitration decision to which no appeal is pending from such judgment or
decision and if the time to appeal therefrom has elapsed (a " _Directive_ "),
Parent or the Representative may, at their sole discretion, provide a copy of
such final Directive to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to the non-instructing
Party), accompanied along with a written instruction to the Escrow Agent from
the instructing Party to effectuate such Directive. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall funds be released to the Representative pursuant
to a Directive (A) prior to the Interim Release Date, in any event or (B)
following the Interim Release Date and prior to the Termination Date, unless
such funds would otherwise be subject to release pursuant to _Section
3(c)(i)_, below.

 

(c) _Release of Funds_.

 

(i) Promptly following the date that is twelve (12) months from the date of
this Agreement (the " _Interim Release Date_ "), Parent and the
Representative shall deliver a Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent directing
the Escrow Agent to release to the Representative for distribution to the
Stockholders and the Gain Share Recipients an amount equal to the amount of
any remaining Escrow Property in excess of (A) $[ _ _] [NTD: 50% of
initial indemnity escrow amount] _plus_ (B) any unresolved claims made by the
Parent Indemnified Parties as of the Interim Release Date under the terms of
the Merger Agreement (" _Unresolved Claims_ "); _provided_ , that, if the
balance of the Escrow Account, taking into account any Unresolved Claims, as
of the Interim Release Date is less than $[ _ _] [NTD: 50% of initial
indemnity escrow amount] no disbursements shall be made pursuant to this
_Section 3(c)_; and _provided, further_ that if no disbursement is made in
accordance with the foregoing

 



3  provision and subsequent to the Interim Release Date and prior to the
Termination Date, any amounts previously claimed by Parent to be owed to a
Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 3_ hereof are finally
determined not to be so owed to a Parent Indemnified Party (a " _Resolved
Claim Amount_ "), then the portion of such Resolved Claim Amount equal to the
shortfall between (x) the remaining balance in the Escrow Account, taking
into account any Unresolved Claims, and (y) $[ _ _] [NTD: 50% of
initial indemnity escrow amount] shall be retained in the Escrow Account,
and Parent and the Representative shall deliver a Joint Instruction to the
Escrow Agent directing that the remaining portion of the Resolved Claim
Amount, together with any interest, dividends, gains and other income earned
with respect thereto, be released to the Representative (for distribution by
the Representative to the Stockholders and the Gain Share Recipients).

(ii) Promptly following the date that is twenty-four (24) months from the
date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), Parent and the
Representative shall deliver notice to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to release to the Representative for distribution to the Stockholders
and the Gain Share Recipients an amount equal to the difference between (i)
the amount remaining in the Escrow Account as of the Termination Date and (ii)
any unresolved claims made by the Parent Indemnified Parties as of the
Termination Date under the terms of the Merger Agreement. Any Escrow Funds
held by the Escrow Agent beyond the Termination Date shall be released by the
Escrow Agent to the applicable party or parties at such time as a Joint
Instruction or a Directive is delivered to the Escrow Agent. Parent and the
Representative shall use their respective reasonable efforts to resolve all
disputes or claims as promptly as possible following the Termination Date.

(d) _Other Disbursements_. At any time prior to the Termination Date, Parent
and the Representative may deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Instruction
relating to the disposition of the Escrow Property in a writing signed by
Parent and the Representative, and the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow
Property in accordance with any such Joint Instruction.

 

(e) _Remedy Not Exclusive_. The Representative hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the payment of Escrow Property to any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Escrow Agreement shall not limit or otherwise affect any right of
indemnification or payment which such Parent Indemnified Parties may have
pursuant to Section 7.3 of the Merger Agreement or otherwise under the Merger
Agreement or pursuant to the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy
and that the Escrow Property does not constitute an exclusive remedy for
Damages incurred by, or other amounts owed to, such Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to the Merger Agreement except to the extent set forth in the Merger
Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that the amounts distributed to Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 3_ are insufficient to fully
indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties for all Damages (including Damages
arising after distribution of all the Escrow Funds and the termination of this
Escrow Agreement) or to fully satisfy other claims of Parent Indemnified
Parties under the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders shall be liable to
Parent Indemnified Parties for such amounts in accordance with, and subject to
the limitations set forth in, the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 

(f) Any disbursements pursuant to this _Section 3_ will be made by the Escrow
Agent within three (3) Business Days (as defined in _Section 6_) after the
Escrow Agent verifies the payments instructions in accordance with the
procedure set forth on _Schedule II_.

 

4\. Authorized Persons. Each of the Interested Parties shall, on the date of
this Escrow Agreement, deliver to the other parties a certificate in the form
of Schedule I hereto as to the incumbency and specimen signature of at least
two (2) officers or other representatives of such party authorized to act for
and give and receive notices, requests and Instructions on behalf of such
party in connection with this Escrow Agreement (each such officer or other
representative, an " _Authorized Person_ "). From time to time, an Interested
Party may, by delivering to the other parties a revised certificate in
the form of _Schedule I_ , change the information previously given, but each
of the parties hereto shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the then-
current schedule until receipt of a superseding schedule.

 

5\. Facsimile/Email Instructions. Each of the Interested Parties hereby
provides to the Escrow Agent and agrees with and accepts the authorizations,
limitations of liability, indemnities, security procedure and other provisions
set forth on _Schedule II_ hereto in connection with the Escrow Agents
reliance upon and compliance with instructions and directions sent by such
parties via e-mail, facsimile and other similar unsecured electronic methods.

from time to time such identifying information and documentation as may be
available for such party in order to enable the Escrow Agent to comply with
Applicable Law, including, but not limited to, information as to name,
physical address, tax identification number and other information that will

Parties in accordance with its CIP.

 

23\. Shareholder Communication Act, Etc. With respect to securities issued in
the United States, the Shareholders Communications Act of 1985 (the "Act")
requires Escrow Agent to disclose to the issuers, upon their request, the
name, address and securities position of Parent who are (a) the "beneficial
owners" (as defined in the Act) of the issuers securities, if the beneficial
owner does not object to such disclosure, or (b) acting as a "respondent bank"
(as defined in the Act) with respect to the securities. (Under the Act,
"respondent banks" do not have the option of objecting to such disclosure
upon the issuers request.) The Act defines a "beneficial owner" as any person
who has, or shares, the power to vote a security (pursuant to an agreement or
otherwise), or who directs the voting of a security. The Act defines a
"respondent bank" as any bank, association or other entity that exercises
fiduciary powers which holds securities on behalf of beneficial owners and
deposits such securities for safekeeping with a bank, such as Escrow Agent.
Under the Act, Parent is either the "beneficial owner" or a "respondent bank."



   ¨ | Parent is the "beneficial owner," as defined in the Act, of the
securities to be held by Escrow Agent hereunder. 
---|--- 



   ¨ | Parent is not the beneficial owner of the securities to be held by
Escrow Agent, but is acting as a "respondent bank," as defined in the Act,
with respect to the securities to be held by Escrow Agent hereunder. 
---|--- 

IF NO BOX IS CHECKED, ESCROW AGENT SHALL ASSUME THAT PARENT IS THE BENEFICIAL
OWNER OF THE SECURITIES.

 



10 _For beneficial owners of the securities only_ :

 



   ¨ | Parent objects 
---|--- 



   ¨ | Parent does not object 
---|--- 

to the disclosure of its name, address and securities position to any issuer
which requests such information pursuant to the Act for the specific purpose
of direct communications between such issuer and Parent.

IF NO BOX IS CHECKED, ESCROW AGENT _SHALL RELEASE_ SUCH INFORMATION UNTIL IT
RECEIVES A CONTRARY WRITTEN INSTRUCTION FROM PARENT.

With respect to securities issued outside of the United States, information
shall be released to issuers only if required by law or regulation of the
particular country in which the securities are located.

 

Parent agrees to disseminate in a timely manner any proxies or requests for
voting instructions, other proxy soliciting material, information
statements, and/or annual reports that it receives to any other beneficial
owners.

24\. Disclosure; Information Sharing. [Note: BNY to provide form of NDA.] The
Bank of New York Mellon Corporation is a global financial organization that
provides services to clients through its affiliates and subsidiaries in
multiple jurisdictions (the " _BNY Mellon Group_ "). The BNY Mellon Group may
centralize functions including audit, accounting, risk, legal, compliance,
sales, administration, product communication, relationship management,
storage, compilation and analysis of customer-related data, and other
functions (the " _Centralized Functions_ ") in one or more affiliates,
subsidiaries and third-party service providers. Each Interested Party consents
to the disclosure of and authorizes BNY Mellon to disclose information
regarding such Interested Party to the BNY Mellon Group and to its third-
party service providers who are subject to confidentiality obligations with
respect to such information, in connection with the Centralized Functions. In
addition, the BNY Mellon Group may aggregate such Interested Partys data
with other data collected and/or calculated by the BNY Mellon Group and the
BNY Mellon Group will own all such aggregated data, _provided_ that the BNY
Mellon Group shall not distribute or disclosed any such aggregated data in a
format that identifies the Interested Party or the Interested Partys data
with the Interested Party. Each Interested Party acknowledges that BNY Mellon
may store the names and business addresses of such Interested Partys
employees on the systems or in the records of the BNY Mellon Group or its
service providers for purposes of the Centralized Functions.

 

25\. Successors and Assigns of Escrow Agent. Any corporation or other company
into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may
be consolidated, or any corporation or other company resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent shall be a
party, or any corporation or other company succeeding to the business of the
Escrow Agent shall be the successor of the Escrow Agent hereunder, and shall
succeed to all of the Escrow Agents rights, duties and obligations hereunder,
without the execution or filing of any paper with any party hereto or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, except where an
instrument of transfer or assignment is required by law to effect such
succession, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

 

26\. Third Party Beneficiaries; Assignment. Nothing set forth in this Escrow
Agreement shall be construed to confer any benefit to any third party who is
not a party to this Escrow Agreement, other than the Parent Indemnified
Parties who are intended to be third party beneficiaries hereunder in the
manner and to the extent stated herein. This Escrow Agreement is not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder and shall not be assigned by any party by operation of law
or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the non-assigning parties,
provided, however, that Parent shall have the right to transfer and assign
any and all of its rights and obligations to any entity which at the time of
such transfer and assignment is controlled by Parent or by Affiliates of
Parent. No assignment of the interest of any of the parties hereto shall be
binding upon the Escrow Agent unless and until written notice of such
assignment shall be filed with and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. Nothing
contained herein shall restrict the assignment of this Escrow Agreement
by the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 25_ above.

14 Schedule II

 

ELECTRONIC METHODS AUTHORIZATION, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY

 

Interested Party Authorization, Limitation of Liability and Indemnity. Each
Interested Party hereby authorizes the Escrow Agent and its affiliates (the "
_Bank_ ") to rely upon and comply with instructions and directions sent by it
via e-mail, facsimile and other similar unsecured electronic methods (but
excluding on-line communications systems covered by a separate agreement
(such as the Banks Inform or CA$H-Register Plus system) (" _On-Line
Communications Systems_ ")) (" _Electronic Methods_ ") by persons reasonably
believed by the Bank to be authorized to give instructions and directions on
behalf of the Interested Party. Except as set forth below with respect to
funds transfers, the Bank shall have no duty or obligation to verify or
confirm that the person who sent such instructions or directions is, in fact,
a person authorized to give instructions or directions on behalf of the
Interested Party (other than to verify that the signature on a facsimile is
the signature of a person authorized to give instructions and directions on
behalf of the Interested Party); and the Bank shall have no liability for any
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or sustained by the relevant
Interested Party as a result of such reliance upon or compliance with such
instructions or directions. Each Interested Party agrees to assume all risks
arising out of its own use of Electronic Methods to submit instructions and
directions to the Bank, including without limitation the risk of the Bank
acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse
by third parties.

Funds Transfer Security Procedures. With respect to any "funds transfer," as
defined in Article 4-A of the Uniform Commercial Code, the following security
procedure will apply: An Interested Partys payment instruction is to include
the name and (in the case of a facsimile) signature of the person initiating
the funds transfer request. If the name is listed as an Authorized Person on
a certificate in the form of Schedule I hereto delivered pursuant to the
Agreement, the Bank will confirm the instructions by telephone call to any
person listed as an Authorized Person, who may be the same person who
initiated the instruction. When calling back, the Bank will request from the
relevant Interested Partys staff member his or her name. If the name is
listed in the Escrow Agents records as an Authorized Person, the Bank will
confirm the instructions with respect to amount, names and numbers of accounts
to be charged or credited and other relevant reference information. Where the
Agreement contemplates a Joint Instruction from the Interested Parties,
the Escrow Agent shall call back both Parent and the Representative. Each
Interested Party acknowledges that the Bank has offered such Interested Party
other security procedures that are more secure and are commercially reasonable
for such Interested Party, and that such Interested Party has nonetheless
chosen the procedures described in this paragraph. Each Interested Party
agrees to be bound by any payment order issued in its name, whether or not
authorized, that is accepted by the Bank in accordance with the above
procedures. When instructed to credit or pay a party by both name and a unique
numeric or alpha-numeric identifier (e.g. ABA number or account number), the
Bank, and any other bank participating in the funds transfer, may rely solely
on the unique identifier, even if it identifies a party different than the
party named. This applies to beneficiaries as well as any intermediary bank.
Each Interested Party agrees to be bound by the rules of any funds transfer
network used in connection with any payment order accepted by the Bank
hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall not be obliged to make any payment or
otherwise to act on any instruction notified to it under this Agreement if it
is unable to validate the authenticity of the request by telephoning an
Authorized Person who has not executed the relevant request or instruction of
the relevant Interested Party. Payment or otherwise to act on any instruction
by Authorized Person of the relevant Interested Party will be made by the
Escrow Agent within three (3) Business Days (as defined in _Section 6_) after
Escrow Agents verification of instructions as set forth above.

 

Authorization. This authorization shall remain in full force and effect until
the earlier of termination of this Agreement or the date it is canceled,
revoked or amended by written notice received by the Escrow Agent; and
replaces and supersedes any previous authorization from an Interested Party to
the Bank relating to the giving of instructions by facsimile, e-mail or
other similar Electronic Methods (but excluding On-Line Communications
Systems) in relation to this Agreement, and is in addition to all other
authorizations. Notwithstanding any revocation, cancellation or amendment of
this authorization, any action taken by the Bank pursuant to this
authorization prior to the Banks actual receipt and acknowledgement of a
notice of revocation, cancellation or amendment shall not be affected by such
notice.

 

Indemnity. Each Interested Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Bank against any and all claims, losses, damages liabilities, judgments,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively,
"Losses") incurred or sustained by the Bank as a result of or in connection
with the Banks reliance  

 



15  upon and compliance with instructions or directions given by such Interested
Party (and, to avoid doubt, not any other Interested Party) by Electronic
Methods, provided, however, that such Losses have not arisen from the gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Bank.

Representation. Each Interested Party hereby represents and warrants to the
Bank that this authorization is properly given and has been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of such Interested Party.
