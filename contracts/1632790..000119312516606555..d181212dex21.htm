authorized to give instructions or directions on behalf of the Interested Party (other than to verify that the signature on a facsimile is the signature of a person authorized to give instructions and directions on behalf of the Interested Party);
and the Bank shall have no liability for any losses, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or sustained by the relevant Interested Party as a result of such reliance upon or compliance with such instructions or directions. Each Interested Party
agrees to assume all risks arising out of its own use of Electronic Methods to submit instructions and directions to the Bank, including without limitation the risk of the Bank acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk of interception and
misuse by third parties.<B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Funds Transfer Security Procedures</B>. With respect to any &#147;funds transfer,&#148; as defined in
Article 4-A of the Uniform Commercial Code, the following security procedure will apply: An Interested Party&#146;s payment instruction is to include the name and (in the case of a facsimile) signature of the person initiating the funds transfer
request. If the name is listed as an Authorized Person on a certificate in the form of Schedule I hereto delivered pursuant to the Agreement, the Bank will confirm the instructions by telephone call to any person listed as an Authorized Person, who
may be the same person who initiated the instruction. When calling back, the Bank will request from the relevant Interested Party&#146;s staff member his or her name. If the name is listed in the Escrow Agent&#146;s records as an Authorized Person,
the Bank will confirm the instructions with respect to amount, names and numbers of accounts to be charged or credited and other relevant reference information. Where the Agreement contemplates a Joint Instruction from the Interested Parties, the
Escrow Agent shall call back both Parent and the Representative. Each Interested Party acknowledges that the Bank has offered such Interested Party other security procedures that are more secure and are commercially reasonable for such Interested
Party, and that such Interested Party has nonetheless chosen the procedures described in this paragraph. Each Interested Party agrees to be bound by any payment order issued in its name, whether or not authorized, that is accepted by the Bank in
accordance with the above procedures. When instructed to credit or pay a party by both name and a unique numeric or alpha-numeric identifier (e.g. ABA number or account number), the Bank, and any other bank participating in the funds transfer, may
rely solely on the unique identifier, even if it identifies a party different than the party named. This applies to beneficiaries as well as any intermediary bank. Each Interested Party agrees to be bound by the rules of any funds transfer network
used in connection with any payment order accepted by the Bank hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall not be obliged to make any payment or otherwise to act on any instruction notified to it under this Agreement if it is unable to validate the
authenticity of the request by telephoning an Authorized Person who has not executed the relevant request or instruction of the relevant Interested Party. Payment or otherwise to act on any instruction by Authorized Person of the relevant Interested
Party will be made by the Escrow Agent within three (3)&nbsp;Business Days (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;6</U>) after Escrow Agent&#146;s verification of instructions as set forth above.<B> </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Authorization</B>. This authorization shall remain in full force and effect until the earlier of termination of this Agreement or the date
it is canceled, revoked or amended by written notice received by the Escrow Agent; and replaces and supersedes any previous authorization from an Interested Party to the Bank relating to the giving of instructions by facsimile, e-mail or other
similar Electronic Methods (but excluding On-Line Communications Systems) in relation to this Agreement, and is in addition to all other authorizations. Notwithstanding any revocation, cancellation or amendment of this authorization, any action
taken by the Bank pursuant to this authorization prior to the Bank&#146;s actual receipt and acknowledgement of a notice of revocation, cancellation or amendment shall not be affected by such notice.<B> </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Indemnity</B>. Each Interested Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Bank against any and all claims, losses, damages
liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees) (collectively, &#147;Losses&#148;) incurred or sustained by the Bank as a result of or in connection with the Bank&#146;s reliance <B>
