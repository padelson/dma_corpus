Preamble    

Whereas, the Sellers with the Company Trustee together hold all of the issued
and outstanding shares in the Company, subject to the resolution of the
matter set forth in Section 7 below.    

Whereas, the Purchaser is a wholly owned subsidiary of Greenfield.    

Whereas, both the Company and Greenfield are engaged in the materially similar
business of supplying data collection services, both panel based and
otherwise, to the marketing research industry. Greenfield is primarily
engaged in the business in North America, and has started to develop
operations in Europe. The Company is primarily engaged in the business in
Europe, but has started to develop operations in North America. The Company
and Greenfield each believe they are the leading independent provider of such
services in their respective markets and believe that North America and
Europe comprise 85% of a three billion dollar worldwide market for
marketing research data collection services. The Company and Greenfield each
serve clients that are global marketing research companies, which clients are
seeking a global supplier of data collection services. The Parties believe
that the acquisition of the Company by Greenfield will serve to create the
global leader in marketing research data collection services, headquartered in
the United States as a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ market.
It is anticipated that following the purchase, the Company (in a legal form
to be determined) will serve as Greenfields operating unit responsible for
operating the combined entitys data collection business in
Europe. Initially, the Company would continue to operate its "media" business
and management will consult regarding the potential expansion of the media
business into North America.    

Whereas, the Purchaser therefore desires to acquire, and the Sellers are
willing to sell, all shares in the Company subject to and under the terms of
this Agreement.    

Whereas, Greenfield is willing to guarantee the performance by the Purchaser
of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement and assume other undertakings
as provided for in this Agreement.    

Now therefore it is agreed as follows:     ##### Table of Contents

the number of such accruals as reflected in the Accounts (only to the extent
not paid before or on the Closing Date) for the period ending on or before
the Accounting Date and (ii) using the same accounting approach
and principles consistently applied as used in the preparation of the
Accounts (including the valuation of the subsidiaries and the amount of the
tax loss carry forwards) for the amount of such accruals for the period from
1 January 2005 until the Closing Date (only to the extent not paid before or

thereof in writing within thirty days following receipt of the Closing
Date Calculation by the Purchaser (the "Notice of Disagreement"). The Notice
of Disagreement shall specify, in reasonable detail, which amounts of the
Closing Date Calculation are incorrect (the "Amounts in Dispute") and the
amounts thereof considered correct by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall be
irrevocably deemed to have agreed to all amounts in the Closing
Date Calculation other than the Amounts in Dispute. If the Sellers
Representative does not receive a Notice of Disagreement within the
aforementioned thirty-day period, the Closing Date Calculation shall become

period of time mutually agreed upon between the Sellers and the Purchaser),

shall be entitled to request an Expert Determination, after the expiration of
the aforementioned period, by giving notice of such request in writing to the
Sellers Representative.

(the "Sellers Balance") shall be paid to the Sellers by the Purchaser within
five (5) Business Days following the date when the Closing Date Calculation
has become final or the date of the Final Determination, as the case may be.
If the Final Closing Date Calculation or the Final Determination, as the case
may be, results in a definitive total Cash Consideration which is lower than
the Estimated Cash Consideration, the difference (the "Purchaser
Balance") shall be paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser within such time
period. The Sellers Balance, if any, shall be paid to the Sellers Bank
Account, except for the pro rata share of Burda Ventures (to be determined by
the ratio of the Known Plaintiff Shares to the Shares sold hereunder), which
shall be paid to the Burda Escrow Agent pursuant to the Burda

     10.   | Indemnification  
---|--- 
     

     10.1   | The Sellers agree to indemnify ( _Schadensersatz leisten_
) the Purchaser (such indemnification to be satisfied by the Escrow Amount
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement) as follows:  
---|--- 
     

       | a)   | Each Seller hereby agrees with the Purchaser (for
itself and on behalf of the Company) to indemnify and keep indemnified on
demand ( _auf Antrag_ ) the Company and the Purchaser against losses and
damages (together, the "Losses") arising from each and every breach of any of
the representations, warranties or covenants made by such Seller in Section 8
that would not have existed or arisen or been incurred had the
relevant representation, warranty or covenant in Section 8 been true or
complied with; provided, however, that the total liability of each Seller
under this Section 10.1a) shall not exceed the total amount of Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration received by such Seller at Closing or
deposited in the Escrow Account for the account of such Seller (the valuation
of the Stock Consideration for this purpose to include any cash received by
such Seller in a Subsequent Sale and the Cash Value of the Stock Consideration
sold or transferred pursuant to any Other Transfer by such Seller). In the
event any Seller becomes liable under this Section 10.1a), such Seller shall
either reimburse the Purchaser in cash (up to the amount of the Cash
Consideration received by such Seller plus (i) any cash received by such
Seller in any Subsequent Sale and (ii) the Cash Value of the Stock
Consideration sold or transferred by such Seller in any Other Transfer)
and/or by delivery of all or parts of the Stock Consideration still owned
by such Seller to the Purchaser (valued at the Cash Value thereof). For
purposes of the foregoing, a "Subsequent Sale" means a sale for cash of any
portion of the Stock Consideration to an unaffiliated third party in an arms-
length transaction; "Other Transfers" means any sales or transfers of any
portion of the Stock Consideration other than Subsequent Sales; and "Cash
Value" shall be calculated using the share price of Greenfield Common Stock
(or such other shares of capital stock as may have been exchanged or received
for Greenfield Common Stock) at the close of business of Nasdaq for the day
the Seller is to deliver the cash or shares, as the case may be, to
the Purchaser pursuant to the foregoing sentence.

       | b)   | The Management Shareholders hereby agree with the
Purchaser (for itself and on behalf of the Company) to indemnify and keep
indemnified on demand ( _auf Antrag_ ) the Company and the Purchaser against
Losses arising from (1) each and every breach of any of the representations
and warranties made in Section 9 that would not have existed or arisen or
been incurred had the relevant representation or warranty in Section 9
been true or complied with, and (2) each and every breach of any other
representation, warranty, agreement, covenant or undertaking of the Sellers
in this Agreement to the extent not governed by Section 10.1a) or 10.1c) (the
liability of the Other Shareholders for such other Losses therefore hereby
being explicitly excluded). Purchasers exclusive remedy for such Losses
shall be a demand to the Escrow Agent for payment or delivery of shares in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement out of the full remaining Escrow Cash
and Escrow Stock.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | c)   | The Sellers hereby agree with the Purchaser (for itself
and on behalf of the Company) to indemnify and keep indemnified on demand (
_auf Antrag_ ) the Company and the Purchaser against Losses arising from each
and every breach of the obligations of the Company, the Sellers, or the
Company Trustee under Section 21.1 that would not have existed or arisen or
been incurred had the relevant obligation in Section 21.1 been complied with;
provided, however, that to the extent such Losses were indemnified by
a release from the Escrow Agreement each Seller must promptly replenish pro
rata the amount of any such Loss after release thereof from the Escrow Amount
(each Sellers pro rata share determined on the basis of the Shares sold by
such Seller hereunder to the total number of all Shares sold under this
Agreement).  
     

     10.2   | In case of a breach of representations, warranties and
covenants made by the Sellers, the Sellers will have thirty (30) days from
receipt of written notice from Purchaser describing such breach and the
Losses therefrom in reasonable detail (a "Notice") to cure such breach (
_Naturalrestitution_ ).  
---|--- 
     

     10.3   | The parties are in agreement and hereby expressly confirm
that the warranties, representations, agreements, undertakings and covenants
made this Agreement represent a special agreement within the meaning of
Section 311 paragraph 1 BGB and that neither such agreement nor any other
declaration made by the Sellers in this Agreement shall be construed to be
only a guarantee of the properties of a thing ( _Beschaffenheitsgarantie_ )
within the meaning of Sections 443 or 444 BGB.  
---|--- 
     

     10.4   | The Sellers hereby acknowledge to and agree with the
Purchaser (for itself and on behalf of the Group) that, to the extent that
the Sellers have relied directly or indirectly on any information or opinions
supplied to any of them by the Group or its employees or agents in making or
giving the said warranties, undertakings and representations, they hereby
waive all claims they have or may have against the Group in respect of any
information or opinions so supplied or omitted to be so supplied.

     10.5   | Each of the warranties, representations, agreements,
undertakings or covenants in this Agreement shall be separate and
independently given and made subject only (i.e. the liability of the Sellers
being expressly excluded in case of the following) to the matters (i)
disclosed in the Group Disclosure Schedules with respect to such warranty,
representation or covenant (provided that every matter, document and item
referred to, set forth or described under any section of the Group Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed disclosed against each of the representations,
warranties, agreements, undertakings or covenants in this Agreement to
the extent the applicability thereto of such matter, document or item is
reasonably apparent from the Group Disclosure Schedule), or (ii) that are
reasonably apparent from other provisions of this Agreement to apply to such
warranty representation, agreement, undertaking or covenant (for the
avoidance of doubt, no specific identification or cross-referencing shall
be necessary for such application to be reasonably apparent).  
---|--- 
     

     10.6   | The Sellers shall forthwith disclose to the Purchaser in
writing any matter or thing which may arise or become known to any of them
after the date hereof and prior to Closing that is a breach of or
inconsistent with or may render inaccurate any of the representations,
warranties or undertakings made by them in this Agreement, or which is a
breach or may otherwise give rise to a claim under any agreement or covenant
in this Agreement. In the event of such disclosure or the Purchaser otherwise
becoming aware before Closing of any such matter or thing as is referred to
above, the Purchaser may at any time before Closing rescind the Agreement by
giving notice in writing to the Sellers Representative to that effect unless
the relevant matter or thing does not result in a material adverse effect on
the business conditions of the Company or Greenfield.  
---|--- 
     

     10.7   | The following provisions shall operate to further limit
the liability of the Sellers under this Section 10:  
---|--- 
     

       | a)   | The Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any claim
or claims hereunder pursuant to any breaches under Section 8 (other than
breaches under Section 8.1e)) and Section 9 unless (i) the amount of an
individual claim exceeds the Currency Equivalent of nineteen thousand two
hundred thirty euros (19,230) (provided however that the same or similar
claims or a series of claims shall be considered an individual claim for the
purposes of this threshold) and (ii) the aggregate amount of such claims
(i.e. only those claims exceeding the Currency Equivalent of nineteen
thousand two hundred thirty euros (19,230)) exceeds the Currency Equivalent
of three hundred eighty-four thousand six hundred fifteen euros (384,615) in
which case then also the claims which counted against the latter threshold
shall be recoverable by the Purchaser. Losses shall be computed net of (i)
any present or future advantages and benefits ( _Vorteilsausgleich_ )
(including avoided losses and savings and increases in the value of any asset
owned by the Group or the Purchaser ( _Abzug neu f ur alt_)) directly related
to or arising from the particular claim therefor, and (ii) any amounts of
such Losses that are or could be reimbursed by commercially reasonable levels
of insurance coverage. In case such Loss could be recovered from a third
party, the Purchaser shall assign such claim to the Sellers Representative
upon the request of the Sellers Representative.

     ##### Table of Contents

  

   

       

\- 43 -    

       | b)   | The Management Shareholders shall have no liability
hereunder to the extent that an allowance or provision or reserve in respect
of the matter to which the liability relates has been made in the Accounts or
the matter has already been considered in connection with a negative
adjustment of the purchase price or another Loss for which the Purchaser has
been indemnified.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | c)   | In the event that the Purchaser shall be in receipt of any
claim that might constitute or give rise to a liability hereunder, the
Purchaser shall with reasonable dispatch notify the Sellers Representative
thereof and from time to time thereafter keep the Sellers Representative
informed of all material developments thereto (including by providing the
Sellers Representative with any decisions, motions, filings, or other such
documentation with respect to such claim) and give the relevant Sellers
reasonable opportunity to suggest means of defense; provided that the
failure to give such notice shall relieve the Sellers from liability
hereunder only to the extent that the failure to give such notice prejudices
the Sellers material rights or defenses with respect to such claim. The
Sellers shall not be liable for any settlement of any such claim effected
without their prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. No judgment or government order rendered or issued against any
member of the Group shall be deemed to be a Loss unless (i)(A) it
is demonstrated by the Purchaser by the provision of a certified copy of the
relevant final judgment or order, and (B) such judgment or order shall have
been rendered following a valid third party notice ( _Streitverk undung_) in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 74, 68 of the Code of Civil
Procedure ( _Zivilprozessordnung_ ) or any equivalent provisions under
applicable foreign law; or (ii) the Purchaser has granted the right to the
Sellers Representative to assume the defense against the relevant claim at
its own cost by appointing and instructing counsel on behalf of the relevant
company at the reasonable discretion of the Sellers Representative
provided in the case of (ii) that such counsel shall be instructed to keep
the Purchaser or the relevant company fully and timely informed about such
proceedings and provided with copies of all documents being exchanged in such
proceedings. The foregoing sentence shall only operate to determine the
existence of a loss but shall not establish the existence of a breach by any
of the Sellers. In the event of a tax audit or other tax contest ("Tax
Contest") relating to the Group that relates to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, Greenfield shall allow the Sellers Representative to
be present at meetings with taxing authorities and to review and comment on
all correspondence with taxing authorities. Greenfield will consult in good
faith with the Sellers Representative regarding the conduct of any such Tax
Contest. Each of the Sellers Representative and the Sellers agrees to
furnish or cause to be furnished to Greenfield, upon reasonable request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the
Sellers or the Group as is reasonably necessary for the preparation for any
audit or Tax Contest for any period ending on or before the Closing Date.

       | d)   | Claims of the Purchaser based on liability of the
Sellers under Section 8 shall be barred by the statute of limitations ( _Verj
ahrung_) seven (7) years after the Closing. All other claims of the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement shall be barred by the statute of limitations (
_Verj ahrung_) eighteen (18) months after Closing, provided that Notice
thereof given prior to the expiration of such eighteen-month period shall
be sufficient to allow such claim to proceed thereafter (provided that
arbitration is commenced within sixty (60) days of such Notice as provided in
the Escrow Agreement).  
---|---|--- 
      
     | e)   | In order to partially or wholly satisfy liability of the
Sellers under Section 8, the Purchaser shall be entitled (but not obligated)
to demand payment or delivery of  shares from the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement out of the percentage of the remaining Escrow Cash
and Escrow Stock corresponding to the percentage listed for the relevant
Seller in Schedule 3.2.  
      
     | f)   | Losses arising from each and every breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants made in Section 8 by Burda Ventures
as to the Known Plaintiff Shares shall exclusively be indemnified by a demand
of payment or for delivery of shares from the Burda Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of Burda Escrow Agreement.  
      
     | g)   | The Parties confirm that they are aware that the Company,
upon the explicit written request of Greenfield, set up a German GmbH on or
about 31 March 2005 with a share capital of twenty-five thousand euros
(25,000) in order to enable the Purchaser to undertake certain restructuring
measures after Closing (the "Formation"). The Parties hereby approve the
Formation and agree that all claims of the Purchaser for a breach of any of
the representations, warranties, agreements, covenants or undertakings of
the Sellers or the Company in this Agreement in relation to or resulting from
the Formation alone shall be excluded. Furthermore, the Parties agree that
the Formation shall be disregarded for the purpose of the provisions of this
Agreement (e.g. for the Closing Balance Sheet, Net Cash Adjustment and
Working Capital calculations).  
     

     10.8   | The limitations to liabilities pursuant to Section 10.7a)
shall not apply to the representations and warranties in Section 9.2 of this
Agreement.

the Sellers shall severally, but not jointly, be liable for any obligations
under this Agreement.

     10.10   | The provisions of this Section 10 (except for this
Section 10.10) shall not apply to breaches of the covenant in Section 16.1,
i.e. each breaching Management Shareholder shall be fully liable in case of a
breach to the extent provided for in Section 16.4 and no recourse shall be
available for such breach to the Escrow Amount except to the extent of the
assignment provided for in the last sentence of Section 16.4.

     10.11   | Tax Loss Carry Forwards and Write-Ups  
---|--- 
     

       | a)   | To the extent the tax authorities do not recognize or
hold invalid the past or current tax loss carry forwards of the Group and
such non-recognition or invalidity leads to a higher tax assessment for
periods ending on or before Closing (after taking into account and having
used recognized tax loss carry forwards to offset a potential higher tax
assessment), the Sellers shall be liable for Losses resulting from or
in connection with the non-recognition or invalidity of such tax loss carry
forwards of the Group. Beyond that, the invalidity or non-recognition of tax
loss carry forwards of the Group shall not qualify as a Loss (i.e. any
liability of the Sellers in connection therewith beyond the foregoing
sentence shall be excluded).  
---|---|--- 
      
     | b)   | To the extent the tax authorities demand a write-up of the
value of the participation in any of the subsidiaries of the Company, which
is not (i) caused alone by the Closing (or the identity of the Purchaser or
Greenfield) or (ii) related to the performance or non-performance of any
measure or act (irrespective of whether they have a retroactive effect) of
the Company or the Purchaser after Closing, and such write-up leads to a
higher tax assessment for periods ending on or before Closing (after
taking into account and having used recognized tax loss carry forwards to
offset a potential higher tax assessment), the Sellers shall be liable for
Losses resulting from or in connection with the write-up of the value of the
participation in any of the subsidiaries of the Company. Other than as
described in the foregoing sentence, the write-up of the value of the
participation in any of the subsidiaries of the Company shall not qualify as
a Loss.  
      
     | c)   | To the extent a tax audit for periods ending on or before
the Closing Date leads to a higher tax assessment for such periods
(irrespective of whether caused by any of the circumstances described in
Sections 10.11b) and 10.11c) or by any other reason) that can be (in part or
full) offset by the existing tax loss carry forwards of the Group, (i) the
Sellers shall only be liable for such Losses that result after the existing
tax loss carry forwards of the Group have been used to the fullest
extent possible to offset such higher tax assessment, and (ii) the reduction
of the existing tax loss carry forwards of the Group on that basis alone
shall not qualify as Loss (i.e. any liability of the Sellers in connection
with the reduction of the tax loss carry forwards shall be excluded).

Each Seller hereby severally but not jointly represents, warrants and agrees
by way of an independent guarantee agreement under Section 311 paragraph 1

such documents have since the time of their filing been amended or
supplemented, but excluding preliminary filings and material, the "Greenfield
SEC Reports"), are publicly available on the SECs website at  _www.sec.gov_.
The Greenfield SEC Reports are all the documents (other than
preliminary material) that Greenfield was required to file with the SEC since
such date. As of their respective dates, Greenfield SEC Reports (i) complied
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact

material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present (subject, in the case of the
unaudited interim financial statements, to normal, recurring year-end audit
adjustments) the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of
Greenfield and its Subsidiaries for the respective dates and periods
presented. Except as disclosed in the Greenfield SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, since 31 December 2004 there has not been

whole.

cutback rights in case of a registration of Greenfield Common stock, of any
other class of securities of Greenfield (with the exception of Greenfield
Common stock being sold by Greenfield). No outstanding registration rights
have been granted to any other Greenfield shareholder other than those rights
granted pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Greenfield has no
outstanding classes of capital stock other than common stock.

     12.13   | Each of Greenfield and the Purchaser (either alone or
together with its advisors and counsel) has sufficient knowledge and

economic merits and risks of acquiring the Shares as contemplated by
