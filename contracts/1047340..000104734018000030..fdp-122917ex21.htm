THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of February 5, 2018
is by and among Mann Packing Co., Inc., a California corporation (the
"Company"), the sellers set forth in Schedule 1 hereto (the "Sellers"),
Lorraine A. Koster as the representative of each Seller as more fully
described herein (the "Representative"), and Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A.,
Inc., a Florida corporation ("Purchaser"). The Company and the Sellers are
sometimes referred to herein as the "Seller Parties," and the Seller Parties,
the Representative and Purchaser are sometimes referred to herein as the
"Parties."

WHEREAS, the Sellers collectively own all of the issued and outstanding shares
of Series A common stock, no par value (the "Class A Shares"), and Series B
common stock, no par value (the "Class B Shares" and together with the Class A
Shares, the "Shares"), of the Company;

WHEREAS, the Shares constitute all of the issued and outstanding equity
securities of the Company; and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire for Purchaser to purchase from each of Sellers,
and for each of Sellers to sell to Purchaser, the number of Shares set forth
opposite such Seller's name in Schedule 1 hereto under the heading "Number of
Shares Owned" (collectively, the "Purchased Shares"), subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations and
warranties made herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which hereby are acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I 
PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale .

(a) On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing"), Sellers shall
sell to Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens (other than any restrictions
under the Securities Act and Blue Sky Laws), and Purchaser shall purchase from
Sellers, all of the Purchased Shares. In furtherance thereof, at the Closing
each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens (other
than any restrictions under the Securities Act and Blue Sky Laws), any stock
certificates representing the Purchased Shares, each duly endorsed in blank or
with duly executed stock powers attached.

(b) The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Shares acquired by Purchaser
hereunder (collectively, the "Transaction Consideration") shall consist of:

(i) Three Hundred Sixty Million Eight Hundred Forty-Six Thousand Three Hundred
Ten Dollars ($360,846,310) in cash; minus

(ii) the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness; minus



(30042.00001) #841357.7 

(iii) the sum of (x) the amount of the Seller Transaction Expenses, which
remain unpaid as of the Closing, and (y) the Change of Control Payments; minus

(iv) the Remaining Gonzales Project Expenditures in excess of Twenty-Two
Million Dollars ($22,000,000); minus

(v) the amount, if any, by which the Closing Net Working Capital is less than
the Target Net Working Capital; plus

(vi) the amount if any, by which the Closing Net Working Capital is greater
than the Target Net Working Capital.

All fixed amounts payable to Sellers for the Purchased Shares (other than
amounts to be held in escrow) shall be paid to the Sellers through the
delivery of a promissory note (the "Promissory Note") in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit F, made out to the Representative as the representative of
all Sellers, with a term of three (3) days and bearing interest at the annual
rate of 1.81% compounded annually.

The Transaction Consideration shall be allocated and distributed promptly,
following payment of the Promissory Note by the Representative among the
Sellers pro rata in accordance with the number of the Shares being sold by
each Seller, subject to the reserve for expenses and obligations of the
Sellers set forth in Section 9.18 and any other deductions and reserves
reasonably allocable to all of the Sellers as determined by the
Representative; provided, however, that a portion of the Transaction
Consideration shall be used to discharge and pay in full (i) all Indebtedness
for Borrowed Money, (ii) the Seller Transaction Expenses and (iii) the Change
of Control Payments. In addition, (i) Twenty Eight Million Dollars
($28,000,000) of the Transaction Consideration (the "SPA Escrow Amount") shall
be deposited at Closing into an escrow account (the "SPA Escrow Account")
pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A if executed by Bank of America, N.A., as Escrow
Agent, or with substantially similar terms in all material respects if
executed by SunTrust Banks, Inc. (or an Affiliate thereof), as Escrow Agent
(the "SPA Escrow Agreement"), as partial security for the obligations of
Sellers under Section 1.4, Section 1.5 and Article VII (including with respect
to the Product Recall and the Scheduled Indemnities). Subject to the terms of
the SPA Escrow Agreement and to the extent that funds remain in the Escrow
Account as of the dates indicated below, such amounts shall be released to the
Representative for the benefit of and further distribution to the Sellers as
follows:

(a)$3,000,000 (less any Escrow Claims in respect of the Product Recall) within
five (5) Business Days after the Recall Release Trigger;

(b)$2,000,000 (less any Escrow Claims in respect of any pre-Closing Taxes),
within five (5) Business Days of the Tax Release Trigger; and

(c)the General Indemnity Release Amount (less any Escrow Claims) within
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the "General Indemnity Release
Date"); provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no amounts shall be released from the SPA Escrow Account prior to the
General Indemnity Release Date if such release causes



the aggregate amount in the Escrow Account (less the Escrow Claims) to be less
than $25,000,000.]



Section 1.2 Closing Date . The Closing shall take place at the offices of
Akerman LLP, 98 S.E. 7th Street, Suite 1100, Miami, Florida 33131, at 10:00

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Representative shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser (i) a good faith
estimate of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital"), which shall be certified by the Representative as its good
faith estimation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date and (ii) a
good faith estimate of the Remaining Gonzales Project Expenditures (the
"Estimated Remaining Gonzales Project Expenditures"). Sellers and the Company
shall promptly provide Purchaser access to all relevant documents and
information reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with its review of
the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Remaining Gonzales Project
Expenditures (including all components thereof). Prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall notify the Representative of any objections to the Estimated
Net Working Capital and/or the Estimated Remaining Gonzales Project
Expenditures (including any component thereof). If Purchaser has any such
objections, the Representative and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any such objections, and the obligation of Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby will be subject to Purchaser's agreement to
the Representative's determination and calculation of the Estimated Net
Working Capital and the Estimated Remaining Gonzales Project Expenditures
(including all components thereof).

(b) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall:

(i) Deliver to the Representative, for the benefit of Sellers, the Promissory
Note with a principal amount equal to the following (collectively, the
"Closing Note/Cash Consideration"):

(D) the sum of (x) the amount of the Seller Transaction Expenses (as evidenced
by full and final invoices in a form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser)
and (y) the Change of Control Payments, minus

(E) the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness for Borrowed Money, minus

(F) the amount, if any, of the Estimated Remaining Gonzales Project

(ii) deposit the SPA Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent;

(iii) deposit the Put Option Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent;

(iv) pay the amount of all Indebtedness for Borrowed Money from the
Transaction Consideration as provided in the Payoff Letters;

(v) pay the MIPA Closing Payment to Priority Properties, Inc., an Arizona
corporation ("PPI"), Anthony Costa and Sons, a California general partnership
("Costa and Sons"), and Bay Area Business Solutions, Inc. (d/b/a ClearPath
Business Advisors, Inc.) ("ClearPath") pursuant to the written instructions of
the Representative; and

(vi) pay the Seller Transaction Expenses and the Change of Control Payments
from the Transaction Consideration pursuant to written instructions of the
Representative, other than those Change of Control Payments which are not due
at Closing.

Section 1.4 Net Working Capital Adjustment .

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver to the Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement")
calculating the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Net
Working Capital"); provided, however, that a failure by Purchaser to deliver
the Closing Statement within such ninety (90) day period shall not prevent
Purchaser from obtaining a Net Working Capital adjustment hereunder pursuant
to a Closing Statement delivered thereafter.

(b) If the Representative disputes any amounts as shown on the Closing
Statement, the Representative shall deliver to Purchaser within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Closing Statement a statement (the "Dispute Notice")
setting forth the Representative's calculation of such amount and describing
in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such different amount.
If the Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within
such thirty (30)



day period, the Closing Statement prepared and delivered by Purchaser shall be
deemed to be the "Final Closing Statement." Purchaser and Representative shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such differences within a
period of thirty (30) days after the Representative has given the Dispute
Notice. If Purchaser and Representative resolve such differences, the Closing
Statement agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the Final Closing
Statement. If Purchaser and the Representative do not reach a final resolution
on the Closing Statement within thirty (30) days after the Representative has
given the Dispute Notice, unless Purchaser and the Representative mutually
agree to continue their efforts to resolve such differences the Neutral
Accountant shall resolve such differences, pursuant to an engagement agreement
among Purchaser, the Representative and the Neutral Accountant (which
Purchaser and the Representative agree to execute promptly), in the manner
provided below. The Neutral Accountant shall only decide the specific items
under dispute by the Parties (the "Disputed Items"), solely in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Neutral
Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by Purchaser or Representative or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either Party. Purchaser and the Representative
shall each be entitled to make a presentation to the Neutral Accountant,
pursuant to procedures to be agreed to among Purchaser, the Representative and
the Neutral Accountant (or, if they cannot agree on such procedures, pursuant
to procedures determined by the Neutral Accountant), regarding such Party's
determination of the amounts to be set forth on the Closing Statement; and the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Neutral
Accountant to resolve the differences between Purchaser and the Representative
and determine the amounts to be set forth on the Closing Statement within
twenty (20) days after the engagement of the Neutral Accountant. The Neutral
Accountant's determination shall be based solely on such presentations of the
Parties (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions and other
terms included herein. The Closing Statement determined by the Neutral
Accountant shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Statement. Such
determination by the Neutral Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the
Neutral Accountant shall be paid by the Party whose calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital is farther from the Neutral Accountant's calculation
thereof. Nothing in this Section 1.4(b) shall be construed to authorize or
permit the Neutral Accountant to: (i) determine any questions or matters
whatsoever under or in connection with this Agreement except for the
resolution of differences between Purchaser and the Representative regarding
the determination of the Final Closing Statement; or (ii) resolve any such
differences by making an adjustment to the Closing Statement that is outside
of the range defined by amounts as finally proposed by Purchaser and the
Representative.

(c) Promptly, but no later than five (5) Business Days after the final
determination thereof, if the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the
Closing Statement: (i) exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, Purchaser
shall pay such excess amount within five (5) Business Days of the
determination and delivery to the Purchaser of the Final Gonzales Project
Expenditures Statement in accordance with Section 1.5, after netting such
excess amount against any payment or deduction made pursuant to Section 1.5,
to the Representative, for the benefit of Sellers; or (ii) is less than the
Estimated Net Working Capital, Purchaser and the Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Purchaser from the SPA Escrow Amount an amount equal to such
shortfall, after netting such shortfall amount against any payment or
deduction made pursuant to Section 1.5. Any payment or deduction made



pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Transaction Consideration by the Parties.

Section 1.5 Gonzales Project Expenditures Adjustment .

(a) Within ninety days (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to the Representative a statement (the "Gonzales Project
Expenditures Statement") containing Purchaser's calculations of the Remaining
Gonzales Project Expenditures (the "Purchaser's Remaining Gonzales Project
Expenditures"); provided, however, that a failure by Purchaser to deliver the
Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement within such ninety (90) day period
shall not prevent Purchaser from obtaining any applicable Remaining Gonzales
Project Expenditures adjustment hereunder pursuant to a Gonzales Project
Expenditures Statement delivered thereafter.

(b) If the Representative disputes any amounts as shown on the Gonzales
Project Expenditures Statement, the Representative shall deliver to Purchaser
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Gonzales Project Expenditures
Statement a statement (the "Gonzales Project Dispute Notice") setting forth
the Representative's calculation of such amount and describing in reasonable
detail the basis for the determination of such different amount. If the
Representative does not deliver a Gonzales Project Dispute Notice to Purchaser
within such thirty (30) day period, the Gonzales Project Expenditures
Statement prepared and delivered by Purchaser shall be deemed to be the "Final
Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement." The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such differences within a period of thirty (30)
days after the Representative has given the Gonzales Project Dispute Notice.
If the Parties resolve such differences, the Gonzales Project Expenditures
Statement agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the Final Gonzales
Project Expenditures Statement. If Purchaser and the Representative do not
reach a final resolution on the Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement within
thirty (30) days after the Representative has given the Gonzales Project
Dispute Notice, unless Purchaser and the Representative mutually agree to
continue their efforts to resolve such differences the Neutral Accountant
shall resolve such differences, pursuant to an engagement agreement among
Purchaser, the Representative and the Neutral Accountant (which Purchaser and
the Representative agree to execute promptly), in the manner provided below.
The Neutral Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute by
the Parties (the "Gonzales Project Disputed Items"), solely in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. In resolving any Gonzales Project Disputed Item,
the Neutral Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by Purchaser and Representative or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by Purchaser and Representative.
Purchaser and the Representative shall each be entitled to make a presentation
to the Neutral Accountant, pursuant to procedures to be agreed to among
Purchaser, the Representative and the Neutral Accountant (or, if they cannot
agree on such procedures, pursuant to procedures determined by the Neutral
Accountant), regarding such Party's determination of the amounts to be set
forth on the Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement; and the Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Neutral Accountant to resolve
the differences between Purchaser and the Representative and determine the
amounts to be set forth on the Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement within
twenty (20) days after the engagement of the Neutral Accountant. The Neutral
Accountant's determination shall be based solely on such presentations of
Purchaser and Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on the
definitions and other terms included



herein. The Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement determined by the Neutral
Accountant shall be deemed to be the Final Gonzales Project Expenditures
Statement. Such determination by the Neutral Accountant shall be conclusive
and binding upon Purchaser and Representative, absent fraud or manifest error.
The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be paid by the Party
whose calculation of the Remaining Gonzales Project Expenditures is farther
from the Neutral Accountant's calculation thereof. Nothing in this Section
1.5(b) shall be construed to authorize or permit the Neutral Accountant to:
(i) determine any questions or matters whatsoever under or in connection with
this Agreement except for the resolution of differences between Purchaser and
the Representative regarding the determination of the Final Gonzales Project
Expenditures Statement; or (ii) resolve any such differences by making an
adjustment to the Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement that is outside of
the range defined by amounts as finally proposed by Purchaser and the
Representative.

(c) Promptly, but no later than five (5) Business Days after the final
determination thereof, if the Purchaser's Remaining Gonzales Project
Expenditures set forth in the Final Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement:
(i) exceeds the Estimated Remaining Gonzales Project Expenditures set forth in
the Gonzales Project Expenditures Statement, Purchaser and the Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to deliver to Purchaser from the SPA Escrow Amount an amount
equal to such excess amount, after netting such excess amount against any
payment or deduction made pursuant to Section 1.4; or (ii) is less than the
Estimated Remaining Gonzales Project Expenditures set forth in the Gonzales
Project Expenditures Statement, Purchaser shall pay such shortfall amount to
the Representative, after netting such shortfall amount against any payment or
deduction made pursuant to Section 1.4, for the benefit of Sellers. Any
payment or deduction made pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Transaction Consideration by the Parties.

required to contribute to, or otherwise been required to participate in any
plan, program or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA. Except as set forth

from the IRS to such effect and the trusts maintained thereto are exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code and nothing has occurred
or will occur through the Closing with respect to any such plan which would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption.
There has been no termination or partial termination of such Qualified Plan
within the meaning of Code Section 411(d)(3) and the present value of all

of the assets of such plan (determined using the actuarial assumption used for

or by the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan or any agreement relating thereto
for all periods ending prior to or as of the Closing have been timely paid or

or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the plan administrator or any
fiduciary of the Employee Benefit Plans with respect to such plans (other than
routine benefit claims), and there are no facts or circumstances which could
form the basis for any such Legal Proceeding. No Employee Benefit Plan is
under audit or investigation by the IRS, DOL, or any other Government Body and

interest, or penalty.

time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

(l) No security issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries forms or has

including Form 8883, consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation
Statement.

(c) Not later than the ninetieth (90th) day following the date on which
Purchaser delivers an Election Notice, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
Sellers a statement (the "Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement") allocating
the aggregate deemed sales price (as such term is defined in Treasury

in accordance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code.

(d) The Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement and the allocations therein
shall become final and binding upon Purchaser and Sellers on the thirtieth
(30th) day following Purchaser's



delivery thereof to Sellers unless Sellers give written notice to Purchaser
prior to such date of Sellers' reasonable objection to the allocation of one
or more items reflected in the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement (the
"Allocation Objection Notice"). The Allocation Objection Notice shall specify
in reasonable detail why any item reflected in the Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement is reasonably objectionable and includes all supporting
schedules, analyses, working papers and other documentation. If an Allocation

appealable upon the earlier of (i) the date on which Purchaser and Sellers
resolve in writing any disputes with respect to the matters specified in the
Allocation Objection Notice, or (ii) the date on which any such disputes are
finally resolved in writing by the Neutral Accountant. During the 30-day
period following the delivery of an Allocation Objection Notice in compliance
with this paragraph, Purchaser and Sellers shall seek in good faith to resolve
any disputes with respect to the matters specified in the Allocation Objection
Notice. If, at the end of such 30-day period, Purchaser and Sellers have not
resolved such disputes, Purchaser and Sellers shall submit to the Neutral
Accountant for review and resolution of any and all matters that remain in
dispute. Purchaser and Sellers shall use their respective good faith efforts
to cause the Neutral Accountant to render a decision resolving the matters in
dispute within sixty (60) days following the submission of such matters to the
Neutral Accountant. The Neutral Accountant shall (A) allow Purchaser and
Sellers to submit written presentations and supporting evidence regarding
their respective positions, copies of which shall be delivered to the other
Party, (B) upon the request of either Purchaser or Sellers, schedule and
conduct a hearing wherein each Party may present its positions and address
appropriate questions from the Neutral Accountant or the other Party regarding
any issue to be addressed by the Neutral Accountant, (C) include reasons for
each relevant determination in its written statement, (D) review only, and
base the resolution of the allocations in dispute solely on, the submissions
by Purchaser and Sellers and (E) not perform an independent review or audit of

Sellers. The Neutral Accountant shall address only the allocations in dispute,
any allocation directly impacted thereto and any adjustment required by Law
resulting from the resolution of the disputed allocations, and any resolution
of a disputed allocation by the Neutral Accountant shall not be outside the
range for such allocation created by the submissions of Purchaser and Sellers.
The Neutral Accountant's determination shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Parties and shall be final, binding and non-
appealable. All fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be borne by
Purchaser and Sellers in inverse proportion as each may prevail on the value
of (and not the quantity of) matters resolved by the Neutral Accountant, which
inverse proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Neutral
Accountant at the time the determination of the Neutral Accountant is rendered
on the merits of the matters submitted.

(e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in Sections 5.8(a) -
(d), each Party shall cooperate with and make available to the other Party and
its employees, agents, actuaries and representatives all information, records,
data and working papers and, upon reasonable notice and subject to the
applicable Party's reasonable safety and security policies and procedures,
shall permit access to its facilities, employees, agents, actuaries and
representatives, in each case as may be reasonably requested in connection

Section 5.10 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation .

(a) Each Seller acknowledges that he, she or it is familiar with the trade
secrets and other confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and the Business. Therefore, and in further consideration of the compensation
to be paid to Sellers hereunder, each Seller agrees to the covenants set forth
in this Section 5.10 and acknowledges that Purchaser would not have entered
into this Agreement but for Sellers' agreement to the restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.10.

(b) In consideration of the benefits of this Agreement to each Seller and
where goodwill is part of such consideration, and in order to induce Purchaser
to enter into this Agreement and for Purchaser to acquire the Purchased
Shares, each Seller agrees that for a period of five (5) years from and after
the Closing Date, no Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, own, operate, lease, manage, control, engage in,
invest in, lend to, own any debt or equity security of, permit his, her or its
name to be used by, act as consultant or advisor to, render services for
(alone or in association with any person, firm, corporate or other business
organization) or otherwise assist in any manner any Person with, as an
employee, employer, consultant, agent, investor, principal, member, partner,
stockholder, manager, officer or director, or in any other individual or
representative capacity, any business that is engaged in or competitive with
the Business, in each case, anywhere in the United States of America or Mexico
(except as a passive owner of less than two percent (2%) of the outstanding
stock of any publicly-traded corporation).

(c) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date, each
Seller shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, induce or attempt to induce any Person who is or was
within the prior two (2) years an employee or consultant of the Company, any

employee or consultant thereof, (ii) hire or engage any Person who is or was
within the prior two (2) years an employee or consultant of any of the Company

Parties, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such
customer, supplier, grower, harvester, warehouser, licensee, licensor,
franchisee or business relation and any of the Company Parties. No Seller
shall ever make or publish any statement or communication which is disparaging
to the business or business reputation of any of the Company Parties, or any
of their respective shareholders, members, managers, officers, directors,
employees, agents or Affiliates.

(d) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Purchaser and each of its
Affiliates, successors and assigns would suffer irreparable harm from a breach
of this Section 5.10 by any Seller and that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of this Section 5.10, Purchaser and each of its Affiliates
or their respective successors and assigns, in addition to other rights and
remedies existing in their favor, shall be entitled to specific performance,
injunctive and other equitable relief



from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce, or prevent any
violations of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security
and at the expense of the breaching Seller, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses). The restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 5.10
shall be construed as agreements independent of any other provision in this
Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of any Seller
against Purchaser, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall
not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Purchaser of any restrictive
covenant contained in this Section 5.10. Purchaser has fully performed all
obligations entitling it to the restrictive covenants set forth in this
Section 5.10.

(e) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares any
term or provision of this Section 5.10 to be invalid or unenforceable, the
Parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified to cover the maximum duration, scope or area
permitted by Law. In addition, in the event of an alleged breach or violation
by any Seller of this Section 5.10, the five (5) year period described in
clauses (b) and (c) above shall be tolled with respect to such Seller until
such breach or violation has been duly cured. Each Seller agrees that the
restrictions contained in this Section 5.10 are reasonable.

(f) Purchaser acknowledges that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, PPI and Costa and Sons (collectively, the "Costas")
,and their respective Affiliates (other than Affiliates, if any, that are
bound by the terms of this Agreement) shall not be limited either from
providing services as a grower or harvester to any Person (other than
harvesting whole-leaf lettuce) or from selling any crops grown or harvested by

Property for which any title commitments have been provided, Sellers agree to
deliver to such title company a standard and customary form of owner's
affidavit in form and substance acceptable to Sellers and such title company
to cause the standard/general title exceptions to be deleted.

aggregate amount of losses incurred and paid by the Company prior to the
Closing (i) which were not reimbursed prior to the Closing, or (ii) the
recovery of which were not factored in to the determination of Net Working

Section 7.1 Indemnity Obligations of Seller Parties.

Subject to the limitations set forth herein, each Seller, jointly and
severally (except with respect to ARTICLE II and Section 5.10 (Non-
competition; Non-solicitation), which shall be severally, but not jointly),
covenants and agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
and the respective equity holders, officers, directors, managers, employees,
agents, advisers and representatives of the foregoing (the "Purchaser
Indemnitees"), from and against, and to pay or reimburse Purchaser Indemnitees
for, any and all claims, Liabilities, losses, fines, costs, diminution in
value, proceedings or damages (whether absolute, accrued, conditional,
incidental, consequential, punitive or otherwise and whether or not resulting
from third party claims), including all reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or in
asserting any of their respective rights hereunder ("Losses"), based on,
resulting from, arising out of or relating to:

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty of any Seller or the
Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or agreement
delivered in connection herewith, it being understood that, in determining the
existence of, and amount of any Losses in connection



with a claim under this Section 7.1(a), all representations and warranties
shall be read without regard and without giving effect to any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification contained therein (as if such
qualification were deleted from such representation or warranty);

(b) any failure of any Seller, the Company or the Representative to perform
any covenant or agreement made or contained in this Agreement, or fulfill any
obligation in respect thereof;

(c) any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any

a taxable year that ended at the end of the Closing Date. In the case of
property Taxes and similar Taxes which apply ratably to a Straddle Period, the
amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date shall equal the Tax for the period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of days in the Straddle Period up to
and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which shall be the
total number of days in the Straddle Period. For the avoidance of doubt, all
Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries under Section 1374 and 1375 of the
Code and under Cal. Rev. Cd. Section 23802(b)(1) shall be apportioned to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and shall be included as Pre-Closing Taxes.

(d) Taxes imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to any obligation
to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined
or unitary or other group basis with respect to a group of corporations that

herewith, it being understood that, in determining the existence of, and
amount of any Losses in connection with a claim under this Section 7.2(a), all
representations and warranties shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification
contained therein (as if such qualification were deleted from such
representation or warranty);

(b) any failure of Purchaser to perform any covenant or agreement made or
contained in this Agreement, or fulfill any other obligation in respect
thereof; and/or

(c) any claims or Legal Proceedings related to the items set forth in Sections

Section 7.3 Indemnification Procedures .

(a) Third Party Claims. In the case of any claim asserted by a third party (a
"Third Party Claim") against a party entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"), notice shall be given by the Indemnified
Party to the party required to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying
Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any
claim as to which indemnity may be sought. If the Indemnifying Party shall
dispute such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall provide written notice of
such dispute to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days of the delivery
of the notice from the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
provide written notice of its dispute of the claim to the Indemnified Party
within such fifteen (15) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have acknowledged and agreed to pay such claim in full and to have waived any
right to dispute such claim. If the Indemnifying Party provides a written
notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of
notice of such claim that it will indemnify and hold the Indemnified Parties
harmless from all Losses related to such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying
Party) to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, provided, however,
that (i) the counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense
of such Third Party Claim shall be subject to the approval of the Indemnified
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) the Indemnified Party
may participate in such defense at such Indemnifying Party's expense, (iii)
the failure by any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim to
the Indemnifying Party as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only
to the extent that, as a result of such failure to give notice, the defense
against such claim is materially impaired, and (iv) the fees and expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the assumption of a Third Party
Claim hereunder by the Indemnifying Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, no
Indemnifying Party, in



the defense of any Third Party Claim, shall consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement that provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary
relief affecting the Indemnified Party or that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a general release from any and all liability with respect
to such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,

Purchaser Indemnitees shall be under no obligation to pursue collection from

this Agreement signed by Purchaser, in the case of an amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver sought to be enforced against Purchaser, or the

waiver sought to be enforced against Sellers. The waiver by any Party of a

a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power
or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by Law.

Section 9.5 Section Headings . The section headings of this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and are to be given no effect in the construction or

guaranteeing next Business Day delivery, and (iii) on the fifth (5th) Business
Day following the date on which the piece of mail containing such
communication is posted, if sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested.

Section 9.7 Severability . If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the balance of this Agreement shall remain in
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

Section 9.8 Binding Effect; Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries . This
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that
no Party may assign its rights and/or obligations hereunder without the
consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may
assign its rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement, in whole or in
part, in connection with any disposition or transfer of all or any portion of
Purchaser, the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses in any form of transaction without the consent of any of the other
Parties. In addition, Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights pursuant
to this Agreement to any lender to Purchaser, the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries as collateral security without the consent of any of
the other Parties. Except as provided in ARTICLE



VII with respect to Persons entitled to indemnification thereunder, nothing in
this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person.

Section 9.9 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, portable document format or
other electronic means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 9.10 Remedies Cumulative . Except as otherwise provided herein, no
remedy herein conferred upon a Party hereto is intended to be exclusive of any
other remedy. No single or partial exercise by a Party hereto of any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof. Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser may, at Purchaser's election,
set-off against any amounts due to any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates, any Losses or other amounts for which such Seller (or any
Affiliate thereof) may be responsible to pay to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.

Section 9.11 Exhibits and Schedules . The exhibits and schedules referred to
herein are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. The
disclosure schedule delivered by Sellers to Purchaser in connection with the
execution of this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule") shall be arranged to
correspond to the specific sections and subsections of this Agreement. Any
information disclosed in one Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed in all other Sections of the Disclosure Schedule where
(i) an express reference thereto is made or (ii) the information on the face
of such disclosure is sufficient to alert a reasonable person of its
applicability to such other Sections of the Disclosure Schedule. The mere
listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item in the Disclosure
Schedule will not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made in this Agreement (unless the representation
or warranty pertains to the existence of the document or other item itself).
The Parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty and covenant
contained herein will have independent significance. If any Party hereto has
breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which the Party has not breached will not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or covenant.

Section 9.12 Interpretation . When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
article, section, paragraph, clause, schedule or exhibit, such reference shall
be deemed to be to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The text of all
schedules is incorporated herein by reference. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." As used herein, words in the
singular will be held to include the plural and vice versa (unless the context
otherwise requires), words of one gender shall be held to include the other
gender (or the neuter) as the context requires, and the terms "hereof,"
"herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import will, unless otherwise
stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement.



Section 9.13 Arm's Length Negotiations . Each Party herein expressly
represents and warrants to all other Parties hereto that (a) said Party has
had the opportunity to seek and has obtained the advice of its own legal, tax
and business advisors before executing this Agreement; and (b) this Agreement
is the result of arm's length negotiations conducted by and among the Parties
and their respective counsel.

Section 9.14 Construction . The Parties agree and acknowledge that they have
jointly participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the
event of an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no
presumptions or burdens of proof shall arise favoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to
any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise.

Section 9.15 Specific Performance . The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed by the
Parties in accordance with the specific terms hereof or were otherwise
breached by a Party. It is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be
entitled, without posting a bond or similar indemnity, to an injunction or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms. Each Party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the
basis that the other Party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity.

Section 9.16 Waiver of Jury Trial . EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

Section 9.17 Time of Essence . With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

Section 9.18 Appointment of the Representative .

(a) Irrevocable Power of Attorney. Each Seller irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Lorraine A. Koster as the Representative, with full and unqualified
power to delegate to one or more Persons the authority granted to it, him or
her hereunder, to act as such Person's true and lawful attorney-in-fact and
agent, with full power of substitution, and authorizes the Representative
acting for such Person and in such Person's name, place and stead, in any and
all capacities to do and perform every act and thing required or permitted to
be done in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, as fully to all intents and purposes as such
Person might or could do in person, including:

(i) to determine the time and place of Closing, to determine whether the
conditions to effect the Closing set forth in Section 6.2 have been satisfied
(or to waive such



conditions), and to terminate (or not to exercise the right to terminate) this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1;

(ii) to take any and all action on behalf of such Sellers from time to time as
the Representative may deem necessary or desirable to fulfill the interests
and purposes of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to
engage agents and representatives (including accountants and legal counsel) to
assist in connection therewith, including the delivery of Purchased Shares and
stock powers to Purchaser at Closing as contemplated hereby;

(iii) to deliver all notices required to be delivered by such Sellers or any
of them;

(iv) to receive all notices required to be delivered to such Sellers or any of
them;

(v) to negotiate, execute and deliver any amendments to and terminations of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to prepare any
modification to the Disclosure Schedule;

(vi) to give such orders and instructions as the Representative in its sole
discretion shall determine with respect to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;

(vii) to retain a portion of the Transaction Consideration for payment of
expenses relating to the transactions or the obligations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, the Representative, or any such Seller arising under or in
connection with this Agreement and maintain a reserve for a period of time in
connection with the payment of such expenses or obligations, and to incur and
pay such expenses and obligations out of such reserve as the Representative
deems appropriate in its sole discretion;

(viii) to take all actions necessary to handle and resolve claims by or
against Purchaser for indemnification by such Sellers under this Agreement;

(ix) to take all actions necessary to handle and resolve any adjustment to the
Transaction Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 or Section 1.5;

(x) to retain and to pay legal counsel and other professionals in connection
with any and all matters referred to herein or relating hereto or any other
Transaction Documents (which counsel or other professionals may, but need not,
be counsel or other professionals engaged by the Company);

(xi) to make, acknowledge, verify and file on behalf of any such Seller
applications, consents to service of process and such other documents,
undertakings or reports as may be required by Law as determined by the
Representative in its, his or her sole discretion after consultation with
counsel; and



(xii) to make, exchange, acknowledge, deliver, amend and terminate all such
other contracts, powers of attorney, orders, receipts, notices, requests,
instructions, certificates, letters and other writings, and in general to do
all things and to take all actions, that the Representative in its, his or her
sole discretion may consider necessary or proper in connection with or to
carry out the aforesaid, as fully as could such Sellers if personally present
and acting.

Each of such Sellers hereby irrevocably grants unto said attorney-in-fact and
agent full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing
necessary or desirable to be done in connection with the matters described
above, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or could
do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that the Representative may
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. Each of such Sellers further
agrees not to take any action inconsistent with the terms of this Section 9.18
or with the actions (or decisions not to act) of the Representative hereunder,
and in any case shall not take any action or other position under this
Agreement without the consent of the Representative. To the extent of any
inconsistency between the actions (or decisions not to act) of the
Representative and of any such Seller hereunder, the actions (or decisions not
to act) of the Representative shall control. Each of such Sellers further
acknowledges and agrees that upon execution of this Agreement, any delivery by
the Representative of any waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate
or other documents executed by the Representative pursuant to this Section
9.18, such Seller shall be bound by such documents as fully as if such Seller
had executed and delivered such documents, and any action (or decision not to
act) taken or otherwise implemented by the Representative under this Agreement
shall be binding upon all of Sellers.

(b) Liability of the Representative. The Representative shall not be liable to
any Seller for any action taken or omitted by it, him or her hereunder or
under any other document executed or delivered hereunder, or in connection
therewith, except that the Representative shall not be relieved of any
liability imposed by Law for willful misconduct or gross negligence. Each
Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Representative shall not be obligated
to take any actions and shall be entitled to take such actions as the
Representative deems appropriate in such Representative's sole discretion, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Representative for all Losses incurred
by the Representative in connection with the performance of its, his or her
duties hereunder or in any way relating to it, him or her in its, his or her
capacity as Representative hereunder, except to the extent that such Losses
are the direct result of the Representative's willful misconduct or gross
negligence.

(c) Actions of the Representative. Each Seller agrees that Purchaser shall be
entitled to rely on any action taken by the Representative, (i) on behalf of
Sellers pursuant to Section 9.18(a) above (each, an "Authorized Action"), (ii)
that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each such Seller as fully as
if such Person had taken such Authorized Action, and (iii) that Purchaser
shall be entitled to rely separately and independently on the actions,
instructions or communications of the Representative (or any successor
Representative thereof). Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that any payment
made by Purchaser on behalf of such Seller to the Representative pursuant to
this Agreement shall constitute full and complete payment to Seller and
Purchaser shall have no



further liability therefor. No Seller shall bring, and each Seller herby
waives any right to bring, any Legal Proceeding against Purchaser as a result
of any actions or inactions of the Representative.

(d) Death or Disability of the Representative. In the event of the death or
permanent disability of the Representative, or its, his or her resignation, a
successor Representative shall be appointed by a majority vote of the holders
