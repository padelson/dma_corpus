vii    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF SHARE ACQUISITION   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF SHARE ACQUISITION (this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of October 25, 2000, is
between Fiduciary Trust Company International, a bank organized under the New
York State Banking Law (the "COMPANY"), and Franklin Resources, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("PARENT").   WHEREAS, Parent is a corporation having
capital divided into shares organized and existing under the Delaware General
Corporation Law;   WHEREAS, the Company is a bank organized and existing
under Article III of the New York State Banking Law (the "NYBL");  
WHEREAS, Section 143-a of the NYBL provides that a company having capital
stock divided into shares which desires to acquire all the capital stock of
one or more corporations organized under or subject to the provisions of
Article III of the NYBL may submit a written plan of acquisition of such
stock to the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York
(the "SUPERINTENDENT");   WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire all of the
Shares (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with the provisions of Section
143-a of the NYBL and, to that end, Parent and the Company wish to adopt this
Agreement which shall constitute the "plan of acquisition" within the meaning
of such Section 143-a;   WHEREAS, the Company Board and the Parent Board
(as hereinafter defined), each has, in light of and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, resolved to deem this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Share Exchange (as
hereinafter defined) provided for herein, advisable to and in the best
interest of their respective shareholders;   WHEREAS, for United States
federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Share Exchange shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE");   WHEREAS, for
accounting purposes, it is intended that the Share Exchange be accounted for
as a "pooling of interests" under Opinion 16 of the Accounting Principles
Board ("APB 16") and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); and   WHEREAS, contemporaneously with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and an
inducement to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, the
Company is entering into a stock option agreement with Parent in the form of
Exhibit A hereto (the "STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which the
Company has granted Parent an option to purchase Shares under the terms and
conditions set forth in the Stock Option Agreement;      NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the premises and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the Company and Parent hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
SHARE EXCHANGE   SECTION 1.1 The Share Exchange. At the Effective Time
(as hereinafter defined) and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the NYBL, each outstanding share of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "SHARES"), other
than as provided in Section 2.1(a) hereof, shall be deemed to be exchanged
for the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (as hereinafter defined)
provided for in Section 2.1(a) below (the "SHARE EXCHANGE"). Following the
Share Exchange and as a result thereof, the Company shall be a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent. The separate corporate existence of each of Parent and
the Company shall continue following the Share Exchange.   SECTION 1.2
Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Share
Exchange shall be consummated and become effective at such time as the
Superintendent files this Agreement, together with all required certificates,
as provided in Section 143-a.3 of the NYBL (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   SECTION
1.3 Closing of the Share Exchange. (a) The closing of the Share Exchange (the
"CLOSING") will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by the
parties (the "CLOSING DATE"), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth
Avenue, New York, New York 10153, or at such other time, date or place as
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. Unless the parties otherwise
agree, the Effective Time shall occur on the Closing Date.   (b) At the
Closing, Parent and the Company shall instruct their respective
representatives to make or confirm the filing of all required certificates in
the office of the Superintendent pursuant to Section 143-a of the NYBL.  
SECTION 1.4 Effects of the Share Exchange. The Share Exchange shall have the
effects set forth in the NYBL.   ARTICLE II   EXCHANGE OF SHARES  
SECTION 2.1 Exchange of Shares. (a) At the Effective Time, each Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time including Shares held
by the Company\'s Deferred Compensation Plan Trust (the    2   "DCP
TRUST") but excluding (x) Shares held by the Company for its own account, (y)
Shares held by Parent, or (z) Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.2 hereof)) shall, by virtue of the Share Exchange and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be deemed exchanged
in consideration for the right to receive fully paid and non-assessable
shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Parent ("PARENT COMMON
STOCK") equal to (A) divided by (B) (the "EXCHANGE RATIO"), with (A) being
the quotient obtained by dividing 825,000,000 by the Parent Average Stock
Price; provided that such quotient shall not be less than 19,466,700 or more
than 23,791,000 and (B) being the number of Shares outstanding as of the
Effective Time to be exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, PARENT AVERAGE
CLOSING PRICE   (b) At the Effective Time, each Share held by Parent or
the Company for its own account immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Share Exchange and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent or the Company
be canceled, retired and cease to exist and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.   (c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of
shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares or any similar event,
the amount of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Exchange Ratio
shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares or such similar
event.   SECTION 2.2 Dissenters\' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Share Exchange and who has complied with the procedures of Section 6022 of
the NYBL for appraisal of such Shares ("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be
exchanged into the right to receive the Share Exchange Consideration, as
provided herein, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or    3   otherwise loses the right to appraisal and payment
under such Section 6022. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails
to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to
appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had
been exchanged as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Share
Exchange Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares, and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have the right to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands. All payments made to the holders of Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Sections 143-a.4 and 6022 of the NYBL shall be made solely
from the assets of the Company.   SECTION 2.3 Exchange Fund. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company
headquartered in New York City reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Shares for the Share
Exchange Consideration (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit
of holders of Shares, certificates representing the Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding Shares. Parent
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section
2.7, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.5. Any cash and certificates of Parent Common Stock deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND."
No holder of Shares shall be required to pay any stock transfer or similar
Tax (as hereinafter defined) upon the exchange of Shares pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement unless the transfer of such Shares to the holder
thereof was not registered in the transfer records of the Company, in which
case the provisions of the last sentence of Section 2.4 shall apply.  
SECTION 2.4 Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "CERTIFICATES") (i) a
letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter
shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify after consultation with the Company; and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the
applicable Share Exchange Consideration, together with any dividends or
distributions which a holder of Certificates has a right to receive pursuant
to Section 2.5. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor shares of Parent Common
Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 (after taking   
4   into account all Shares then held by such holder) and a check
representing an aggregate amount of (x) any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7 and (y) any dividends or distributions which such
holder has a right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.5 or 2.7. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of the Shares which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, shares of Parent Common Stock
evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7 and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5, may
be issued with respect to such Shares to such a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.   SECTION 2.5
Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of
such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.7 until
such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.4.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws (as hereinafter defined), following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest
thereon, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time but
prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.  
SECTION 2.6 No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the exchange of the Shares in
accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II (including any
cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.5 and 2.7) shall be deemed to have
been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares.   SECTION 2.7 Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. No fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued to holders of Shares, but
each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 2.7 from the Exchange Agent a cash payment in
lieu of such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, as applicable (each
a "FRACTIONAL INTEREST") representing such holder\'s proportionate interest
in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of all such
holders of the aggregate of the fractions of shares of Parent Common Stock
which would    5   otherwise be issued ("EXCESS SHARES"). The sale of
the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") through one or more member firms of the
NYSE, as the case may be, and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Shares otherwise entitled to receive Fractional
Interests, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such
holders of shares (the "SHARE TRUST"). The Company shall pay all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the
expenses and compensation, of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with
such sale of the Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the Share Trust to which each holder of Shares shall be entitled,
if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising
the Share Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
Fractional Interests to which such holder of Shares is entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Fractional Interests to which
all holders of Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
Shares in lieu of any Fractional Interests, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of Shares without interest.  
SECTION 2.8 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the
instruction of Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Share Exchange Consideration with respect to the Shares
formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Sections 2.1, 2.4 and 2.7 and any dividends or distributions with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state or local court
or tribunal or administrative, governmental or regulatory body, agency or
authority (a "GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY")) shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.   SECTION 2.9 No Liability. None of
Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any Share Exchange Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.   SECTION 2.10 Investment of the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent.   SECTION 2.11 Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, the    6   posting by
such person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Share
Exchange Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented
thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and
unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.   SECTION 2.12
Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Share Exchange Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
and/or from any cash in the amount of dividends or other distributions to
which a holder of Parent Common Stock is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of a Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the Shares in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent.   SECTION 2.13 Stock Transfer Books. The stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the
records of the Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted
into the Share Exchange Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.5.   SECTION 2.14 Affiliates. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no shares of Parent Common Stock or cash
shall be delivered pursuant to the Share Exchange to a person who may be
deemed an "affiliate" of the Company in accordance with Section 6.14 hereof
for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"SECURITIES ACT"), or for purposes of qualifying the Share Exchange for
"pooling of interests" under APB 16 and the applicable SEC rules and
regulations until such person has executed and delivered to Parent the
written agreement contemplated by Section 6.14. The Company believes that the
individuals listed on Schedule 2.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (as
hereinafter defined) are the "affiliates" of the Company as of the date of
this Agreement for the purposes of the transactions contemplated hereby and
the Parent agrees that, absent a material change in circumstances, such
individuals are the only persons who will be required to execute and deliver
the written agreements contemplated by Section 6.14.  SECTION 2.15
Consultation Regarding Dividends. Prior to any change of the regularly
scheduled record dates for the payment of dividends, the Company and Parent
shall consult with the other party and hereby agree that no such change will
have the effect of causing the Company\'s shareholders to fail to receive
a   7   regular quarterly dividend payment either as a Parent or Company
shareholder.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the

to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as
now conducted and proposed by the Company to be conducted, except where the

defined) on the Company.   (b) Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all Subsidiaries of the Company.   (c) Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing does not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(d)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has heretofore delivered to
Parent accurate and complete copies of the organizational certificate and
bylaws, as currently in effect, of each of the Company and its U.S.

Capitalization of the Company and Its Subsidiaries. (a) The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of: 15,000,000 Shares, of which
7,276,168 Shares were issued and outstanding as of the close of business on

asset.   SECTION 3.3 Authority Relative to This Agreement. (a) The Company
has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. No other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the
Stock Option Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (other than, with respect to the Share Exchange and this
Agreement, the Company Requisite Vote (as hereinafter defined)). This
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement have been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitute valid, legal and binding
agreements of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable

transfer and similar Laws of general applicability related to or affecting
creditors\' rights or by general equity principles.   (b) The Board of
Directors of the Company (the "COMPANY BOARD") has duly and validly

including the Share Exchange.   SECTION 3.4 Reports; Financial
Statements.(a) Since January 1, 1998, the Company has timely filed all
reports and other documents, together with any amendments required to be made
with respect thereto, that were required to be filed with any Governmental
Entity, including the SEC (the "REGULATORY DOCUMENTS"), and has paid all fees
and assessments due and payable in connection therewith.   (b) As of their
respective dates, the Regulatory Documents of the Company complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Laws (as
hereinafter defined), and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Regulatory Documents, and none of the
Company\'s Regulatory Documents, as of their respective dates, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company has previously delivered or made available to
Parent a complete copy of each Regulatory Document filed with the SEC, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the "FDIC") or the New York State Banking
Department after January 1, 1998, including a Form ADV for any Subsidiary of
the Company that is a registered Investment Advisor (as defined in the
Advisers Act (as hereinafter defined)), and will deliver to Parent promptly
after the filing thereof a complete copy of each Regulatory Document filed
with the SEC, the FDIC or the New York State Banking Department after the

violation with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Governmental Entity and (ii) have been no material disagreements or disputes
with any Governmental Entity with respect to the   10   business,
operations, policies or procedures of the Company since January 1, 1998.  
(c) The Company has made available to Parent: (i) its Annual Reports to
Shareholders for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999;
(ii) unaudited financial statements as of and for the quarters ended
March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2000; (iii) all definitive proxy
statements relating to the Company\'s meetings of shareholders (whether

either filed by the Company with the SEC or distributed to shareholders since
January 1, 1998 (each such reports, financial statements, proxy statements
and other reports, together with the amendments thereto, the "COMPANY
REPORTS"). None of such Company Reports contained, when filed, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company Reports complied as to form in all material respects
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
("GAAP") (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or in the case of
quarterly statements except for the absence of notes thereto), and accurately
reflected in accordance with GAAP the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and changes in financial position for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments). Since January 1, 2000, there has
not been any material change, or any application or request for any material
change, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accounting principles,
methods or policies for financial accounting or Tax purposes, except for such
change required by Law, SEC regulation or generally applicable changes in
GAAP.   SECTION 3.5 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for
those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on the latest
balance sheet as of September 30, 2000 and liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the date of
such balance sheet, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any material
liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent
or otherwise, and whether due or to become due or asserted or unasserted,
which would be required by GAAP to be reflected in or reserved against in a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and no liabilities that would be
required by GAAP to be disclosed in the notes thereto, other than liabilities
disclosed in the Company Reports incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, were not otherwise disclosed to Parent.  
SECTION 3.6 Absence of Changes. Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, or to the extent publicly disclosed by the
Company in the Company Reports, since December 31, 1999 (the "AUDIT
Date"), there have been no events, changes or developments with respect to
the Company or its Subsidiaries, which do or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.    11     Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or to the extent publicly disclosed in the Company
Reports, since the Audit Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their business in the ordinary and usual course consistent with

usual course of business consistent with past practice), or (ii) any
guarantee, endorsement or other incurrence or assumption of liability
(whether directly, contingently or otherwise) by the Company or any
Subsidiary for the obligations of any other person (other than any Wholly-
Owned Subsidiary), other than in the ordinary and usual course of business
consistent with past practice;   (d) any creation or assumption by the
Company or any Subsidiary of any Lien on any material asset of the Company or
any Subsidiary other than in the ordinary and usual course of business
consistent with past practice;   (e) any making of any loan, advance or
capital contribution to or investment in any person by the Company or any
Subsidiary other than (i) investments made in the ordinary and usual course
of business consistent with past practice, (ii) loans, advances or capital
contributions to or investments in Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries or (iii) loans
or advances made in the ordinary and usual course of business consistent with
past practice;   (f) (i) any contract or agreement entered into by the
Company or any Subsidiary on or prior to the date hereof relating to any
material acquisition or disposition of any assets or business or (ii) any
modification, amendment, assignment, termination or relinquishment by the

applicable Law, making of any change to any of its material methods of
reporting income or deductions for federal income Tax purposes from those
employed in the preparation of its most recently filed federal income Tax
return.   SECTION 3.7 Information Supplied. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to
be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock as required by the terms of this Agreement pursuant to the Share

officers and directors or any of its Subsidiaries should occur which is
required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the S-4, the
Proxy Statement or an Application, the Company shall promptly so advise

Violations. Except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
or the Stock Option Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will violate,
conflict with or result in any breach of, require any consent, waiver or
notice under any term of, or result in the reduction, loss or cancellation of
any benefit or the creation or acceleration of any right or obligation under
(i) any provision of the respective organizational certificate or bylaws (or
similar governing documents) of (x) the Company or (y) any of

Service ("IRS") determination letter; (iv) the most recent financial
statements and actuarial valuations, if applicable; (v) summary plan

of any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code) for any excise Tax or civil penalty.   (d) Except
as set forth in Section 3.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule:   (i)
As of the date hereof, there is no "amount of  unfunded benefit liabilities"
as defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA  in any of the respective Company
Employee Benefit Plans subject to Title  IV of ERISA ("TITLE IV PLANS"). As
of the date hereof, each of the  respective Title IV Plans are fully funded
in accordance with the  actuarial assumptions used by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation  ("PBGC") to determine the level of funding required in
the event of the  termination of such Title IV Plan and the "benefit
liabilities" as defined  in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA of such Title IV
Plan using such PBGC  assumptions do not exceed the assets of such Title IV
Plan.   (ii) Neither the Company nor any person under common  control or
treated as a single employer with the Company ("ERISA  AFFILIATE") has
terminated any Title IV Plan; or   (e) Each of the Company Employee Benefit
Plans which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so "qualified" and
the trusts maintained pursuant thereto are exempt from federal income
taxation under Section 501 of the Code, and the Company knows of no fact
which would adversely affect the qualified status of any such Plan or the
exemption of such trust.   (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor    16   the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will by itself or in combination with any other event, except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (i) result in any payment becoming
due, or increase the amount of compensation or benefits to any current or
former employee or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or
(ii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
compensation or benefits to any current or former employee and director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or increase any benefits under any
Company Employee Benefit Plan.   SECTION 3.14 Environmental Liability. There
are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions,
causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation
activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or
that could reasonably result in the imposition, on the Company of any
liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or
federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including, without
limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against the Company,
which liability or obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of the
Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action
or governmental investigation that would impose any such liability or
obligation on the Company. The Company is not subject to any agreement,
order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental
Entity or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to
the foregoing that would reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   SECTION

affiliated combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or has been a member, has timely filed all federal, state,
local and non-U.S. income and franchise Tax Returns (as hereinafter defined)
and all other material Tax Returns and reports required to be filed by it or
has timely filed requests for extensions of the filing deadline on such Tax
Returns. All such Tax Returns are complete and correct in all material
respects. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has paid (or the Company
has paid on its Subsidiaries\' behalf) all Taxes shown as due on such
Tax Returns for the periods covered by such Tax Returns and there are no
other Taxes due for which adequate reserves have not been established.  
(b) The Company is a "bank" as defined in Section 581 of the Code.   (c) No
deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that have not been fully paid or
adequately provided for in the appropriate financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, no requests for waivers of the time to
assess any Taxes are pending, and no power of attorney with respect to any
Taxes has been executed or filed with any taxing authority.    17   
(d) No material liens for Taxes exist with respect to any assets or
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory
liens for Taxes not yet due.   (e) None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing agreement, Tax
indemnity obligation or similar agreement, arrangement or practice with
respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing agreement, closing agreement
or other agreement relating to Taxes with any taxing authority).   (f) The
Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes and has duly
and timely withheld from employee salaries, wages and other compensation and
has paid to the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required

with the SEC the S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus and form of
proxy, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of

accountants and lawyers to, use all reasonable best efforts to have or cause
the S-4 declared effective as promptly as practicable after filing with the
SEC, including, without limitation, causing its accountants to deliver
necessary or required instruments, such as opinions, consents and
certificates, and will take any other action required or necessary to be
taken under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise in connection with
the registration process (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to
service of process in any jurisdiction). To the extent necessary, the Company
will cooperate with Parent to complete the foregoing. The Parent shall, as
promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, provide to the Company
copies of any written comments and advise the Company of any oral comments,
with respect to the S-4 received from the staff of the SEC. The Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
its shareholders at the earliest practicable date.   SECTION 6.2 Regulatory
Matters. (a) Subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, each
of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consult
and cooperate with each other and in good faith promptly (i) take, or cause
to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply with all
legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries
with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) prepare and file all
necessary documentation, effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings with, and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of, all
Governmental Entities, including without limitation, the FRS, which

this Agreement.   (b) In particular, Parent shall prepare and file all

the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which
appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.     34    (d)
Parent and the Company shall keep the other reasonably informed as to the

relating to the exchange of information, provide to each other, promptly
after filing, copies of such notices and applications and all supplemental or
related filed materials.   (e) Parent and the Company shall, upon request,
furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their

may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with or any statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company any
of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (f) Parent and the
Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication
from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes
such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any required
approval of any Governmental Entity will not be obtained or that the receipt
of any such approval will be materially delayed.   (g) Subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, each of Parent and
the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective commercially reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor
the Company shall be required to disclose to the other any personal
financial statements or other similar information concerning their directors,
officers, shareholders or their respective individual affiliates.   SECTION
6.3 Letter of Accountants. To the extent appropriate and/or required by
either party:   (a) The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to
cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of Ernst and Young LLP, the
Company\'s independent auditors, dated a date within two (2) business days
before the date on which the S-4 shall become effective and addressed to
Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary
in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
S-4.    35    (b) Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause
to be delivered to the Company a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
Parent\'s independent auditors, dated a date within two (2) business days
before the date on which the S-4 shall become effective and addressed to the
Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
S-4.   SECTION 6.4 Meeting. (a) The Company shall take all lawful action to
(i) cause a special meeting of its shareholders (the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDER
MEETING") to be duly called and held as soon as practicable after the S-4 is
declared effective for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and (ii) solicit proxies from its shareholders to obtain the
Company Requisite Vote for the approval and adoption of this Agreement. The
Company Board shall (i) recommend that the shareholders of the Company adopt
this Agreement and thereby approve the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) take all lawful action (including the solicitation
of proxies) to solicit such adoption; provided, however, that the Company
Board may, at any time prior to the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting,
withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation to the extent that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that such withdrawal, modification or change of its recommendation
is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable Law (a "COMPANY SUBSEQUENT DETERMINATION"), but
only at a time that is after the fifth business day following Parent\'s
receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to
make a Company Subsequent Determination. After providing such notice, Company
shall provide a reasonable opportunity to Parent to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to
proceed with its recommendation to its shareholders without a Company
Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that any such adjustment shall
be at the discretion of the parties at the time.   SECTION 6.5
[Intentionally Omitted]   SECTION 6.6 Company Fund Meetings. If and to the
extent necessary, the Company shall assist each of the Company Funds to
prepare and file with the SEC, or other applicable Governmental Entity, as
soon as is reasonably practicable a preliminary proxy statement, together
with a form of proxy, to be used in connection with the meeting of the
shareholders of each such Company Fund for the purpose of approving new
Investment Company Advisor Agreements, or other applicable agreements, with
the current advisor of each such Fund, substantially on the terms of the
current Investment Company Advisor Agreements, to take effect at the
Effective Time, and, as promptly as practicable thereafter, subject to
compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC to the extent
applicable, a definitive proxy statement with respect to such meeting shall
be mailed to the shareholders of such Company Fund. Each such proxy statement
shall comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable
Law.    36    SECTION 6.7 Non-Investment Company Advisory Contract
Consents. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date thereof, the
Company shall inform the Funds, that are not Company Funds, of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and request that such Funds take
such actions as may be necessary in connection with the deemed assignment, as
defined in Section 202(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(the "Advisers Act") (the "DEEMED ASSIGNMENT") of the advisory agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries its Subsidiaries is a party
relating to such Fund.   (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the
date thereof, the Company shall inform its investment advisory clients that
are parties to Non-Investment Company Advisory Agreements ("NICAAS") of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall request
written consent of each such client to the deemed assignment of its NICAA and
use its best efforts to obtain such consent; or in the case of NICAAs which
prohibit assignment or state by their terms that they terminate upon
assignment, the Company will use its best efforts to enter into new
agreements to in substantially identical terms be effective upon Closing and
the deemed assignment. Parent agrees that, except in the case of NICAAs that
prohibit assignment or state by their terms that they terminate upon
assignment or do not, by their terms, require written consent of the client,
the Company may obtain consent by requesting written consent as aforesaid and
informing such client: (a) of the Company\'s intention to effect a deemed
assignment of such NICAAs; (b) of the Company\'s intention to continue the
advisory services, pursuant to the NICAAs with such client after the Closing
if such client does not terminate such NICAAs prior to the Closing; and (c)
that the consent of such client will be implied if such client continues to
accept such advisory services for at least 30 days after receipt of
the Closing without termination (to the extent permitted by the Advisers Act,
and any rules, regulations or interpretations of the SEC thereunder).  
SECTION 6.8 Acquisition Proposals. From the date hereof until the termination
hereof and except as expressly permitted by the following provisions of this
Section 6.8, the Company will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, nor will it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of or
any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor
or representative of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of
any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate, any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 6.8 shall
prohibit the Company from furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof if, and only to the
extent that (A) the Company Shareholder Meeting shall not have occurred, (B)
the Company Board, after consultation with and receipt of advice of
independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is
necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company\'s shareholders under applicable Law, (C) the   37   Company
Board determines, after consultation with and receipt of advice of
its financial advisor and after taking into account the strategic benefits to
be derived from the Share Exchange and the long-term prospects of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely,
if consummated, to result in a transaction more favorable to the
Company\'s shareholders from a financial point of view than the Share
Exchange, and (D) prior to taking such action, the Company (x) provides
reasonable notice to Parent to the effect that it is taking such action and
(y) receives from such person an executed confidentiality/standstill
agreement in reasonably customary form and in any event containing terms at
least as stringent as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
between Parent and the Company. Prior to providing any information to or
entering into discussions or negotiations with any person in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal by such person, the Company shall notify Parent of
any Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, the material terms
and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making it) as promptly
as practicable (but in no case later than 24 hours) after its receipt
thereof, and shall provide Parent with a copy of any written Acquisition
Proposal or amendments or supplements thereto, and shall thereafter inform
Parent on a prompt basis of the status of any discussions or negotiations
with such a third party, and any material changes to the terms and conditions
of such Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly give Parent a copy of any
information delivered to such person which has not previously been reviewed
by Parent. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it
will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities
referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in
this Section 6.8.   SECTION 6.9 Public Announcements. Each of Parent and
the Company will consult with one another before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the Share Exchange, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with a
securities exchange, as determined by Parent or the Company, as the case may
be.   SECTION 6.10 Indemnification. (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,

(each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and, collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES")
against all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or amounts paid in settlement,
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and whether asserted or    38   claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time that are in whole or in part (i) based on, or arising out of
the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of such
party or a Subsidiary of such party or (ii) based on, arising out of or
pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) In the
event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume the obligations set for in this Section 6.10.   (c) Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the persons serving as officers and
directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by the
Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not
less advantageous than such policy with an insurance company with the same or
better rating by A.M. Best Company or otherwise reasonably approved by the
Company Board) with respect to acts and omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in
their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be
required to expend on an annual basis more than 200% of the current annual
amount expended by the Company (the "INSURANCE AMOUNT") to maintain or
procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto and further provided, that if
Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 6.10(c), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
as much comparable insurance as available for the Insurance Amount.   (d)
To the fullest extent permitted by Law, from and after the Effective Time,
all rights to indemnification now existing in favor of the employees, agents,
directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
their activities as such prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the
Company\'s certificate of incorporation or bylaws and those of its
Subsidiaries, in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Share
Exchange and shall continue in full force and effect from the Effective Time
and Parent shall provide substantially similar terms of indemnification for
such persons with respect to their activities as such following the Effective
Time.   (e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives.   SECTION 6.11 Notification of
Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other
communication from any third party (other than parties to investment advisory
agreements) alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions   39   contemplated by this
Agreement, or (ii) the failure or prospective failure to satisfy any
condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement set out in Article VII hereof, or the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event which would permit the termination of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall
not cure such non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   SECTION 6.12
Pooling.Parent shall take reasonable actions as are within its control
necessary to cause the accounting of the Share Exchange to be treated as a
"pooling of interests" under APB 16 and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC.   SECTION 6.13 Employee Matters. (a) Parent will cause
the Company to honor the obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under the provisions of all employment, consulting, termination,
severance, change in control and indemnification agreements (set forth on
Sections 3.13(a) and 3.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or made
available to Parent) between and among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any current or former officer, director, consultant or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent acknowledges that the consummation
of the Share Exchange shall constitute a "change in control" for all purposes
under the agreements specified in the immediately preceding sentence and the
applicable Company Employee Benefit Plans.   (b) As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall arrange for each employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary to participate in the Employee Benefit Plans
covering employees of the Parent ("PARENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS") in
accordance with the eligibility criteria, provided that (i) such participants
shall receive full credit, without duplication, for years of service with the
Company or any Subsidiary (and service otherwise credited by the Company or

Section 6.14 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
persons who are, and all persons who to Parent\'s knowledge will be deemed
at the Closing Date, "affiliates" of Parent for purposes of qualifying the

AgreementS. Parent envisages that the Company will continue to function as an
independent Subsidiary with its current name and Company Board. In light of
the importance of this independence, Parent and the Company agree as
follows:   (a) The Company\'s By-laws will be amended to include
the provisions set forth in clauses (i) -- (iii) of this subsection (a) of
Section 6.20(a) (the "6.20(A) PROVISIONS"):    42    (i) The Parent, as

Company. Persons eligible to serve on  the Company Board shall be:   (A)
the Company\'s directors in office  immediately prior to the effective 
time;   (B) two (2) designees of Parent\'s chief  executive officer;
and   (C) upon the departures of persons  referred to in clause (A) by
reason  of death, retirement, resignation,  or removal for cause, persons

persons. The  Parent shall be entitled to vote  the Shares in its discretion
in  this regard.   (ii) The corporate name, bank regulatory status and 
location of the principal place of business of the Company in New York  shall
not be changed without the prior approval of the Company Board.   (iii) The

necessary in connection with the appointment of  the two (2) designees of
Parent\'s Chief Executive Officer), and the  provisions of the Company\'s By-
Laws regarding the removal of directors  without cause will not be amended or
altered without the approval of a  majority of the Company Board.   Until
the third anniversary of the Closing Date (such three (3) year period is
referred to as the "PERIOD") the 6.20(a) Provisions will not be modified or
removed from the Company\'s By-laws without the approval of a majority of the
Company Board.   (b) The parties agree further that for the Period:   (i)
The Company shall be maintained as a separate  wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent. Subject to the provisions of subsection  (b)(ii) below, Parent shall
consult with the Company Board with regard to  any reorganization of the
operations and corporate structures of the  Subsidiaries of the Company
and/or the integration of such operations and  corporate structures with
Parent\'s businesses and Subsidiaries that Parent  may wish to effect
following the Effective Time, with the goal of  achieving maximum
efficiencies and synergies;   (ii) The global high net-worth individual
businesses of  the Company and Parent as of the Effective Time, excluding
Parent\'s  wrap-fee business, will be developed and managed by the Company
in  consultation with Parent. Parent will advance the expansion of the
global   43    institutional separate account businesses of the Company
for a full range  of growth equities, fixed income and real estate
securities;   (iii) The Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall 
report directly to the Chief Executive Officer of Parent. Personnel 
decisions and the reporting structure concerning the executives, officers 
and employees of Company shall be in the discretion of the Chief Executive 
Officer of the Company within the framework of an overall budget and  within
a context jointly developed by Parent and the Company. In  furtherance of the
foregoing, the policies and procedures applicable to  the executives,
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  on a functional
basis shall be consistent with the analogous policies and  procedures of
Parent in existence from time to time;   (iv) The salary, benefits and terms
of employment of the  Company\'s Chief Executive Officer shall not be
modified without the prior  approval of Parent. Any vacancy in the office of
Chief Executive Officer  of the Company by reason of death, retirement,
resignation or otherwise  shall be filled by the Company Board with the prior
consent of Parent;   (v) (a) Anne M. Tatlock will be a member of the
Parent  Board, as long as she meets the requirements to be a director of a 
corporation organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law and (b)  the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company will be a member of office of  the
chairman of Parent, for so long as such office is in existence,  reporting
directly to the Chief Executive Officer of Parent; and   (vi) Parent will
involve the management of the Company  in the future management of the Parent
group.   (c) Following the execution of this Agreement, the Company and 
Parent will form an integration committee, whose members will be  jointly
agreed upon but will include William Y. Yun and Michael O.  Magdol. The
integration committee will report directly to the Chief  Executive Officers
of Parent and the Company. The integration committee  will study, among other
things, technology development and integration  and back office
consolidation.   SECTION 6.21 Tax-Free Share Exchange. Each of Parent and
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and each agrees to
cooperate with the other and provide one another with such documentation,
information and materials as may be reasonably necessary, proper and
advisable to cause the Share Exchange to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.     44    ARTICLE VII

two (2) sentences shall have been obtained without any limitation,
restriction or condition that has or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
Parent, provided, however, that except with respect to Parent\'s investment
advisory or mutual fund related businesses, no limitation, restriction or
other requirement imposed on Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) by reason of

permanent) which is in effect and enjoins or prohibits or prevents the
consummation of the Share Exchange or any of the other material transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (f) The Company shall have received an
opinion of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent dated as of the Closing
Date, substantially to the effect that, on the basis of the facts and
assumptions described in the opinion, the Share Exchange constitutes a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering

tax representation letters in customary form) of each of Parent and the

and correct as of the date hereof, without regard to any Material Adverse

properly exercised dissenter rights under the applicable provisions of the
NYBL.    46    (f) Each of the persons listed on Schedule 7.2 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall have entered into an employment agreement
with the Company, which agreements shall continue to be in effect as of the
Closing Date, on terms no less favorable than the employment and benefit
arrangements from the Company applicable to such employee on the date hereof,
unless said employee is, as of the Closing Date, deceased or unable to be
employed due to his or her permanent disability.   SECTION 7.3 Conditions
to the Obligations of the Company. The obligations of the Company to

this Agreement that (i) is not cured by the earlier of 60 calendar days after
receipt of written notice from the Company to Parent or the Termination Date

as of the Termination Date.   SECTION 8.4 Termination by Parent. This
Agreement may be terminated and the Share Exchange may be abandoned at any

Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and in either case within 12 months after

Section 8.2 (d) at a time when Parent has not received the requisite
approvals of the FRS or the requisite approval pursuant to the NYBL to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) Section 8.2(a) at a

A   THE TRANSFER OF THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO  CERTAIN PROVISIONS
CONTAINED HEREIN AND TO  RESALE RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED   STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated as of October 25, 2000
(the "Agreement"), by and between Fiduciary Trust Company International, a
bank organized under the New York State Banking Law ("Issuer"), and
Franklin Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Grantee").   W I T N E S
S E T H:  - - - - - - - - - -   WHEREAS, concurrently herewith Issuer and
Grantee are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Share Acquisition of even
date herewith (the "Plan of Acquisition"), providing for, among other things,
the acquisition of Issuer by Grantee; and   WHEREAS, as a condition and
inducement to Grantee\'s willingness to enter into the Plan of Acquisition
and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option
(as hereinafter defined);   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein and in the Plan of Acquisition, Issuer and
Grantee agree as follows:   Section 1. Grant of Option; Adjustment. (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Issuer hereby grants to
Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase that
number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Issuer ("Common Stock") equal to 19.9% of the currently
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, without giving effect to any
shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option, at a purchase price of
$65 per share (the "Option Price"). The number of shares of Common Stock that
may be received upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price are
subject to adjustment as herein set forth.   (b) In the event that any
additional shares of Common Stock are either (i) issued or otherwise become
outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to this
Agreement) or (ii) redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be
outstanding after the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate,
so that, after such issuance or redemption, repurchase, retirement or other
action, such number equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then
issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued
pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach
any provision of the Plan of Acquisition.   A-1    Section 2. Exercise of
Option. (a) The holder of the Option (the "Holder") may exercise the Option,
in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, if, but only if, a
Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the
occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as hereinafter defined);
provided that the Holder shall have sent the written notice of such exercise
(as provided in subsection (d) of this Section 2) within 90 days following
such Triggering Event. Each of the following shall be an "Exercise
Termination Event": (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Plan
of Acquisition) of the Share Exchange (as defined in the Plan of
Acquisition); (ii) termination of the Plan of Acquisition in accordance with
the provisions thereof, other than pursuant to Sections 8.2(b) or 8.4(a); or
(iii) the passage of 12 months after termination of the Plan of Acquisition
pursuant to Sections 8.2(b) or 8.4(a) thereof, unless during such 12-month
period, the Company consummates or enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with any
person (as hereinafter defined) other than Grantee, in which case the
Exercise Termination Event shall be the passage of six months from the
consummation of such Acquisition Transaction whether or not a Notice Date has
occurred.   (b) The term "Triggering Event" shall mean the consummation
by Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Issuer Subsidiary"), without
having received Grantee\'s prior written consent, of an Acquisition
Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with any person (the term "person" for
purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections
3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"1934 Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) other than
Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "Grantee Subsidiary"). For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (w) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, business combination
or other similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Subsidiary of Issuer,
(x) a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition
of 20% or more of the assets of Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in a single transaction or series of related transactions or (y) a
purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation,
share exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term "beneficial
ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto
in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder) of securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of
Issuer, or (z) any substantially similar transaction; provided, however, that
in no event shall any merger, consolidation, purchase or similar transaction
involving only the Issuer and one or more Issuer Subsidiaries or involving
only any two or more Issuer Subsidiaries, be deemed to be an Acquisition
Transaction.   (c) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of
the occurrence of any Triggering Event, it being understood that the giving
of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder
to exercise the Option.   (d) In the event the Holder is entitled to and
wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the
date of which being herein referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i)
the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and
(ii) a place and date not earlier than ten days nor later than 60 business
days from the Notice Date    A-2   for the closing of such purchase (a
"Closing"; and the date of such Closing, a "Closing Date"); provided that if
prior notification to or approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System or any other Governmental Entity is required in connection
with such purchase, the Holder shall promptly file the required notice or
application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the
period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run
instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired
or been terminated, or such approvals have been obtained, and any requisite
waiting period or periods shall have passed. For purposes of determining the
timeliness of exercise, any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur
on the Notice Date relating thereto.   (e) At a Closing, the Holder shall
pay to Issuer an amount equal to the Option Price multiplied by the number of
shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by
Issuer and surrender this Agreement to Issuer, provided that failure or
refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account or to surrender this
Agreement shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option.   (f)
At such Closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available
funds and the surrender of this Agreement as provided in subsection (e) of
this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or
certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by
the Holder, which shares shall be free and clear of all liens, charges or
encumbrances, and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new
Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of
the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer
a letter agreeing that the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose
of such shares in violation of applicable Law or the provisions of this
Agreement.   (g) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a
Closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall
read substantially as follows:   "The transfer of the shares represented by
this certificate is  subject to certain provisions of an agreement between
the  registered holder hereof and Issuer, dated as of October 25,  2000, and
to resale restrictions arising under the Securities  Act of 1933, as amended.
A copy of such agreement is on file  at the principal office of Issuer and
will be provided to the  holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer
of a  written request therefor."  It is understood and agreed that:   (i)
The reference to the resale restrictions of the  Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "1933 Act"), in the above  legend shall be removed by delivery
of substitute certificate(s)  without such reference if the Holder shall have
delivered to Issuer a  copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an
opinion of counsel,    A-3    in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect  that such legend is not required for
purposes of the 1933 Act;   (ii) The reference to the provisions to this 
Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of  substitute
certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have  been sold or
transferred in compliance with the provisions of this  Agreement and under
circumstances that do not require the retention of  such reference; and  
(iii) The legend shall be removed in its entirety if  the conditions in the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both  satisfied. In addition, such
certificates shall bear any other legend  as may be required by Law.   (h)
Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of
the Option provided for under subsection (d) of this Section 2 and the tender
of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the Holder
shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of
Issuer may then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of
Common Stock may not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall
pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local
taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the
preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in
the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.   Section
3. Additional Covenants of Issuer. Issuer agrees: (a) that it shall at all
times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but
unissued or treasury shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be
exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock after
giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and
other rights to purchase Common Stock; (b) that it will not, by charter
amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or
sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions
to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; (c) promptly to take all
action as may from time to time be required by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System or any other Governmental Entity in order to permit
the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue
shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (d) promptly to take all action
provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution.  
Section 4. Loss, Theft, etc. of Agreement. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation
of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of
reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and
cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver
a new Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and
delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part
of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.    A-4    Section
5. Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization, etc. In addition to the
adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon
exercise of the Option pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 1 of this
Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise
of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time
to time as provided in this Section 5. In the event of any change in,
or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of
reclassifications, recapitalizations, stock dividends, stock splits, split-
ups, mergers, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares,
dividends, dividends payable in other securities, distributions on or in
respect of the Common Stock, or the like, the type and number of shares of
Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the Option Price therefor
(including for purposes of repurchase thereof pursuant to Section 7) shall be
appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully preserve the economic
benefits provided hereunder and proper provision shall be made in any
agreement governing any such transaction to provide for such proper
adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuer\'s obligations
hereunder.   Section 6. Reserved.   Section 7. Repurchase of Option. (a)
From and after a Triggering Event, (i) following a request of the Holder,
delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor
thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder at a price (the "Option
Repurchase Price") equal to the amount by which (x) the Market/Offer Price
(as defined below) exceeds (y) the Option Price, multiplied by the number of
shares for which this Option may then be exercised and (ii) at the request of
the owner of Option Shares from time to time (the "Owner"), delivered within
90 days of such occurrence (or such later period as provided in Section 10),
Issuer shall repurchase such number of Option Shares from the Owner as the
Owner shall designate at a price (the "Option Share Repurchase Price") equal
to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so
designated, provided, however, that the Option Purchase Price and Option
Share Repurchase Price shall be subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 23. The term "Market/Offer Price" shall mean the highest of (i) the
price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer
therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid
by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest
closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month
period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the
required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required
repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, and (iv) in the event of a
sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuer\'s assets, the sum of the
price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the
remaining assets of Issuer, less the current market value of the remaining
liabilities of Issuer, each such value as determined by a nationally
recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as
the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, divided by the
number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such
sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other
than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized   
A-5   investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case
may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer.   (b) The Holder and the
Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require Issuer to
repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by
surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal office, this
Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a
written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner, as the case
may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option
Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. Such notice or
notices shall also contain representations and warranties to the effect that
the Holder owns the Option Shares to be repurchased, free and clear of all
Liens, with full power, right and authority to present such Option Shares for
repurchase hereunder. Within five business days after the surrender of the
Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such
notice or notices relating thereto, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the
Option Share Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that
Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable Law from so delivering.  
(c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable Law or as a
consequence of administrative policy arising thereunder from repurchasing the
Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify
the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered,
from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the
portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price,
respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five
business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited;
provided, however, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of
repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under
applicable Law or as a consequence of administrative policy
arising thereunder from repurchasing the Option or the Option Shares, as the
case may be, or from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as
appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase
Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best
efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any
required notices, in each case as promptly as practicable in order to
accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of
repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the
extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall
promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that
portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price
that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as
appropriate, either (x) to the Holder, a new Stock Option
Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of
shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common
Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the
time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore
delivered to the Holder    A-6   and the denominator of which is the
Option Repurchase Price, or (y) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option
Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing.   Section 8. Substitute
Option. (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer
shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any
person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to
permit any person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, to merge into
Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in
connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other
person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common
Stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding
voting shares and voting share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to
sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any
person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, then, and in each such
case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so
that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon
the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged
for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at the election of the Holder, of
either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any
person that controls the Acquiring Corporation.   (b) The following terms
have the meanings indicated:   (i) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (x)
the  continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with 
Issuer (if other than Issuer), (y) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer  is the
continuing or surviving person, and (z) the transferee of all or 
substantially all of Issuer\'s assets.   (ii) "Substitute Common Stock"
shall mean the common  stock issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option
upon exercise of  the Substitute Option.   (iii) "Assigned Value" shall
mean the Market/Offer  Price, as defined in Section 7.   (iv) "Average
Price" shall mean the average closing  price of a share of the Substitute
Common Stock for the one year  immediately preceding the consolidation,
merger or sale in question,  but in no event higher than the closing price of
the shares of  Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding such
consolidation, merger  or sale; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of the
Substitute  Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a
share of  common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by any
company  which controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder may 
elect.   (c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option,
provided that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for
legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as
possible   A-7   and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. The
issuer of the Substitute Option shall also enter into an agreement with the
then holder or holders of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option
Holder") in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be
applicable to the Substitute Option.   (d) The Substitute Option shall be
exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal
to the Assigned Value multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for
which the Option is then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The
exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock
shall then be equal to the Option Price multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which
the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option
is exercisable.   (e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing
paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of
the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the
Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be
exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock
outstanding prior to exercise but for this clause (e), the issuer of the
Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Issuer") shall make a cash payment
to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option
without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the
value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in this
clause (e). This difference in value shall be determined by a nationally
recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as
the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Corporation.  
(f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (a)
of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that
controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations
of Issuer hereunder.   Section 9. Repurchase of Substitute Option. (a) At
the request of the Substitute Option Holder, the Substitute Option Issuer
shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute Option Holder at a
price (the "Substitute Option Repurchase Price") equal to the amount by which
(i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the
exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of shares
of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be
exercised, and at the request of the owner (the "Substitute Share Owner") of
shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Shares"), the Substitute
Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the
"Substitute Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Highest Closing Price
multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated. The term
"Highest Closing Price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of
Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the
date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of
the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the
required repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.   A-8   
(b) The Substitute Option Holder and the Substitute Share Owner, as the case
may be, may exercise its respective right to require the Substitute Option
Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the Substitute Shares pursuant
to this Section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option
Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option
(or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) and
certificates for Substitute Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices
stating that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as
the case may be, elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase
the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 9. As promptly as practicable, and in any event
within five business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or
certificates representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or
notices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute
Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute
Share Repurchase Price therefor or, in either case, the portion thereof which
the Substitute Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable Law
and regulation or as a consequence of administrative policy arising
thereunder from so delivering.   (c) To the extent the Substitute Option
Issuer is prohibited under applicable Law or as a consequence of
administrative policy arising thereunder from repurchasing the Substitute
Option and/or the Substitute Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option
Issuer following, or in connection with, a request for repurchase pursuant to
this Section 9 shall immediately so notify the Substitute Option Holder
and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be
delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the
Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Option
Repurchase Price and the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively,
which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days
after the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no longer so
prohibited; provided, however, that if the Substitute Option Issuer is at any
time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section 9 prohibited under applicable Law or regulation or as a
consequence of administrative policy arising thereunder from delivering to
the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner,
as appropriate, the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and the Substitute
Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and the Substitute Option
Issuer shall use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal
approvals, in each case as promptly as practicable, in order to accomplish
such repurchase), the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner may
revoke its notice of repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute
Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the
latter case, the Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the
Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, that
portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price or the Substitute Share
Repurchase Price that the Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from
delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (x) to the Substitute
Option Holder, a new Substitute Option evidencing the right of the Substitute
Option Holder to purchase that number of shares of the Substitute Common
Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the Substitute Common
Stock for which the surrendered Substitute Option was exercisable at the time
of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a   A-9   fraction, the
numerator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price less the portion
thereof theretofore delivered to the Substitute Option Holder and the
denominator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price, or (y) to the
Substitute Share Owner, a certificate for the Substitute Common Shares it
is then so prohibited from repurchasing.   Section 10. Extension of
Exercise Period. The relevant period for exercise of certain rights under
Sections 2, 7 and 9 shall be extended: (a) to the extent necessary to obtain
all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights and for the
expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (b) to the extent necessary
to avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act by reason of such
exercise.   Section 11. Representations and Warranties of Issuer.
Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as follows:   (a) Issuer
has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Issuer.   (b) Issuer has taken all necessary
corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it to issue, and at
all times from the date hereof through the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise
of the Option, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock at any time and from time to time issuable
hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable, and will be delivered
free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests and
not subject to any preemptive rights.   Section 12. Representations and
Warranties of Grantee. Grantee hereby represents and warrants to Issuer
that:   (a) Grantee has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and, subject to any approvals or consents
referred to herein, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Grantee. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Grantee.   (b) The Option is not being,
and any shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired by Grantee upon
exercise of the Option will not be, acquired with a view to the public
distribution thereof and will not be   A-10   transferred or otherwise
disposed of except in a transaction registered or exempt from registration
under the 1933 Act.   Section 13. Assignment. Neither of the parties hereto
may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or the
Option created hereunder to any other person, without the express written
consent of the other party.   Section 14. Further Assurances. Each of
Grantee and Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to make all filings
with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and any Governmental
Entity necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including without limitation making application to OTC Bulletin
Board and, to the extent required, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and any other Governmental Entity for approval to acquire the
shares issuable hereunder, but Grantee shall not be obligated to apply to
banking authorities for approval to acquire the shares of Common Stock
issuable hereunder until such time, if ever, as it deems appropriate to do so
and Issuer shall not be obligated to apply to banking authorities for
approval to issue the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder until such
time as Parent makes such application.   Section 15. Equitable Relief. The
parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a
breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations of
the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto through
injunctive or other equitable relief.   Section 16. Severability. If any
term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held
by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions
and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines
that the Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to
repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock
provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5
hereof), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire
or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be
permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof.   Section 17.
Delivery. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person,

the parties set forth in the Plan of Acquisition.   Section 18. Governing
Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof (except to
the extent that mandatory provisions of federal or state law apply).   
A-11    Section 19. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.   Section 20.

hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its
behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including
fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers,
accountants and counsel.   Section 21. Entire Agreement; No Third Party
Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Plan

obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as
expressly provided herein.   Section 22. Capitalized Terms. Capitalized
terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned thereto in the Plan of Acquisition.   Section 23. Limitation on
Grantee\'s Total Profit. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, in
no event shall Grantee\'s Total Profit (as defined in subsection (c) of this
Section 23) exceed $25 million (the "Maximum Profit"), and, if the Total
Profit would otherwise exceed such amount, Grantee, at its sole election,
shall either (i) reduce the number of shares subject to the Option (and any
Substitute Option), (ii) deliver to Issuer, or Substitute Issuer, as the case
may be, for cancellation shares of Common Stock or Substitute Common Stock,
as the case may be, previously purchased by Grantee valued at fair market
value at the time of delivery, (iii) pay cash to Issuer, or Substitute
Issuer, as the case may be, (iv) reduce the amount of the Section 7 Option
Repurchase Price or Section 9 Substitute Option Repurchase Price, or (v)
undertake any combination of the foregoing, so that Grantee\'s
actually realized Total Profit shall not exceed the Maximum Profit after
taking into account the foregoing actions.   (b) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Option may not be exercised for a number of
shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a Notional Total
Profit (as defined in subsection (d) of this Section 23) of more than the
Maximum Profit and, if exercise of the Option would otherwise result in the
Notional Total Profit exceeding such amount, Grantee, in its discretion, may
take any of the actions specified in subsection (a) of this Section 23 so
that the Notional Total Profit shall not restrict any subsequent exercise of
the Option which at such time complies with this sentence.    A-12   
(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Total Profit" shall mean the
aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the excess of (x) the
net cash amounts or fair market value of any property received by Grantee
pursuant to the sale of the Option or the Option Shares (or any
other securities into which such Option Shares are converted or exchanged) to
any unaffiliated party, other than any amount received by Grantee upon
the repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares, respectively, by Issuer
pursuant to Section 7 hereof, after payment of applicable brokerage or sales
commissions and discounts, over (y) Grantee\'s aggregate purchase price for
such Option Shares (or other securities), plus (ii) all amounts received by
Grantee upon the repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares by Issuer
pursuant to Section 7 hereof, (iii) all equivalent amounts with respect to
the Substitute Option and Substitute Shares and any amounts paid pursuant to
Section 9 hereof, plus (iv) the amount of any Termination Fee paid to Grantee
pursuant to Section 8.5 of the Plan of Acquisition.   (d) For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Notional Total Profit" with respect to any number
of shares as to which Grantee may propose to exercise the Option shall be the
Total Profit, determined as of the date of such proposed exercise assuming
that the Option were exercised on such date for such number of shares, and
assuming that such shares, together with all other Option Shares held by
Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing
market price for the Common Stock as of the close of business on
the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions). For
purposes of this Section 23, transactions by a wholly-owned subsidiary
transferee of Grantee in respect of the Option Shares transferred to it shall
be treated as if made by Grantee.          A-13     IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be executed on its
behalf by its officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first
above written.     FIDUCIARY TRUST COMPANY INTERNATIONAL   By:/s/ Anne

AFFILIATE LETTER TO PARENT]   [Date]  Franklin Resources, Inc. 777
Mariners Island Blvd. San Mateo, California 94404  Dear Sir/Madam:  
Reference is made to the provisions of the Agreement and Plan of Share
Acquisition, dated as of October 25, 2000 (together with any
amendments thereto, the "ACQUISITION AGREEMENT"), between Fiduciary Trust
Company International, a bank organized and existing under Article III of the
New York State Banking Law (the "COMPANY") and Franklin Resources, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), pursuant to which the Company Shares (as
defined below) shall be exchanged for Parent Shares (as defined below) (the
"SHARE EXCHANGE"). Following the Share Exchange, the Company will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. This letter constitutes the undertakings
of the undersigned contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, as is being
furnished pursuant to Section 6.14 thereof.   I understand that I may be
deemed to be an "affiliate" of the Company, as such term is defined for
purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 ("RULE 145") promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"). Execution of
this letter shall not be construed as an admission of "affiliate" status nor
as a waiver of any rights that I may have to object to any claim that I am an
"affiliate" on or after the date of this letter.   If in fact I were to be
deemed an "affiliate" of the Company under paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule
145, my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of the
common stock, par value $.10 per share, of Parent (the "PARENT SHARES")
received by me in exchange for any shares of common stock, par value $1.00
per share, of the Company (the "COMPANY SHARES") pursuant to the Share
Exchange may be restricted.   I hereby represent, warrant and covenant to
Parent that:   (a) I will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose
of any of the Parent Shares unless (i) such sale, pledge, transfer or
other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such
sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time
to time), or (iii) in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or under a "no-action" letter obtained by me from the
staff of the SEC, such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition will not
violate or is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities
Act;   (b) I will not (i) sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any Company Shares during the 30-day period prior to the Effective Time
(as defined in the Acquisition Agreement) or (ii) sell or otherwise reduce my
risk (within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Commission\'s
Financial Reporting Release No. 1., "Codification of Financial Reporting
Policies",    B-1   Section 201.01 47 F.R. 21028 (April 15, 1982))
relative to any Parent Shares until after such time as consolidated financial
results (including combined sales and net income) covering at least 30 days
of post-Share Exchange combined operations of Parent and the Company have
been published by Parent, except as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 76 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and   (c) I have
not knowingly taken and will not knowingly take or agree to take any action
that would prevent the Share Exchange from qualifying, or being accounted
for, as a "pooling of interests".   I hereby acknowledge that, except as
otherwise provided in the Acquisition Agreement, Parent is under no
obligation to register the sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of the
Parent Shares or to take any other action necessary for the purpose of making
an exemption from registration available.   I understand that Parent will
issue stop transfer instructions to its transfer agents with respect to the
Parent Shares and that a restrictive legend will be placed on certificates
delivered to me evidencing the Parent Shares in substantially the following
form:   "This certificate and the shares represented hereby have been
issued  pursuant to a transaction governed by Rule 145 ("Rule 145")
promulgated  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"),  and may be sold or otherwise disposed of only in accordance with
the  terms of a letter agreement, dated _____________, between the holder
of  this certificate and the issuer of this security (a copy of which is on 
file in the principal office of such issuer) which contains further 
restrictions on the transferability of the shares represented hereby."   The
term Parent Shares as used in this letter shall mean and include not only the
common stock of Parent as presently constituted, but also any other stock
which may be issued in exchange for, in lieu of, or in addition to, all or
any part of such Parent Shares.   I hereby acknowledge that Parent and its
independent public accountants will be relying upon this letter in connection
with the determination that the Share Exchange will qualify and be accounted
for as a "pooling of interests", and that I understand the requirements of
this letter and the limitations imposed upon the transfer, sale or other
disposition of the Company Shares and the Parent Shares.   Very truly
