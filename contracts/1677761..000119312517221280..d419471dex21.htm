referred to herein as the " _Surviving Company_ "), such that following the
Company Merger, the Surviving Company will be an indirect subsidiary of
Parent. The Company Merger shall have the effects specified in the MGCL and
the DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject
thereto, the Surviving Company will possess all of the rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub and all of the
claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub will become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of
the Surviving Company. Simultaneously with the Company Merger, the Surviving
Company shall be admitted as the limited partner of the Merger Partnership.

 

(b) _The Partnership Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DRULPA, at the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3(b)), Merger
Partnership shall be merged with and into the Partnership, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Partnership will cease, with the Partnership
surviving the Partnership Merger (the Partnership, as the surviving entity in
the Partnership Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Partnership_ "), such that following the Partnership Merger, the Surviving
Partnership will be a subsidiary of the Surviving Company. The Partnership
Merger shall have the effects specified in the DRULPA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, the Surviving Partnership
will possess all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
of Merger Partnership and the Partnership and all of the claims, obligations,
liabilities, debts and duties of Merger Partnership and the Partnership will
become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving
Partnership.

1.2. _Closing of the Mergers_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in
writing between the Parties, the closing for the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street,

following the day on which the last to be

 



3  satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described in _ARTICLE
VII_ , the Closing Date shall be a business day no earlier than 2 (two) days
following the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend (as defined in Section
6.14). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean
any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday

1.3. _Effective Times_.

 

(a) _Company Merger Effective Tim_ _e_. On the Closing Date, the Company
and Merger Sub will (i) duly execute and file articles of merger (the "
_Maryland Articles of Merger_ ") with the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland (the " _SDAT_ ") in accordance with the MGCL, (ii) cause
a certificate of merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_DSOS_ ") in accordance with the DLLCA, and (iii) make any other filings,
recordings or publications required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub
under the MGCL or the DLLCA in connection with the Company Merger. The Company
Merger shall become effective upon the later of such time as the Maryland
Articles of Merger have been accepted for record by the SDAT or the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the DSOS, or such later date
and time as shall be mutually agreed to by the Parties in writing and
specified in the Maryland Articles of Merger and the Delaware Certificate of
Merger (the " _Company Merger Effective Time_ "). The Parties shall cause the
Company Merger Effective Time to occur immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time.

(b) _Partnership Merger Effective Tim_ _e_. On the Closing Date

cause Partnership GP to (i) cause a certificate of merger (the " _Partnership
Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with

recordings or publications required to be made by Partnership GP or the
Partnership under the DRULPA in connection with the Partnership Merger. The
Partnership Merger shall become effective after the Company Merger Effective
Time upon such time as the Partnership Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the DSOS, or such later date and time as shall be mutually agreed
to by the Parties in writing and specified in the Partnership Certificate of
Merger (the " _Partnership Merger Effective Time_ ").

1.4. _Tax Consequences_. The Parties intend that, for U.S. federal and
applicable state income tax purposes, (a) the Company Merger shall be treated
as a taxable sale by the Company stockholders of the Company Common Shares in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration, and (b) the Partnership
Merger shall be treated

 



4  as (i) the sale of the Partnership Common Units by the Cash-Out Limited
Partners to the Surviving Company, and (ii) the contribution of Partnership
Common Units by the Roll-Over Limited Partner in the Partnership in exchange
for new partnership preferred units of the Surviving Partnership (each, a "
_New Partnership Preferred Unit_ "). The Parties hereto agree not to take any
position on any tax return that is inconsistent with the foregoing for all
U.S. federal, and, if applicable, state and local tax purposes.

ARTICLE II

 

 _Governing Documents_

 

2.1. _Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Company_. The charter of the
Company as in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
shall be the charter of the Surviving Company immediately following the
Company Merger Effective Time (the " _Charter_ "), until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law. The Parties shall
take all actions necessary so that the bylaws of the Company in effect
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Company (the " _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

2.2. _Limited Partnership Agreement and Certificate of Limited
Partnership of the Surviving Partnership_. The Company shall cause Partnership
GP, in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership, to cause the
Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the
Partnership, dated February 27, 2013, as amended (the " _Partnership
Agreement_ "), to be amended, effective as of the Company Merger Effective
Time, to (x) add to such agreement Article 17 in the form of _Exhibit B_
 hereto, which shall set forth the terms of the New Partnership Preferred
Units and provide that each Person issued a New Partnership Preferred Unit is
admitted as a limited partner of the Surviving Partnership, and (y) make such
other amendments as shall be requested by Parent in order to: (i) eliminate
the parity requirements between units of the Partnership and shares of the
Surviving Company, (ii) provide that the Partnership Agreement may be amended
by Partnership GP without the consent of any other partner, subject to the
voting and consent rights of the holders of New Partnership Preferred Units,
as reflected in _Exhibit B_ , and (iii) make such other adjustments as are
necessary to reflect the fact that, aside from the New Partnership Preferred
Units, the Surviving Partnership will be wholly-owned by the Surviving Company
(as so amended, the " _Amended Partnership Agreement_ "). The Parties
acknowledge and agree that no such amendments will require the consent of any
of the Partnerships limited partners, other than the Company. The Company
agrees to vote any Partnership Common Units and Partnership Series A Preferred
Units held directly or indirectly by it in favor of the Amended Partnership
Agreement. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the
certificate of limited partnership of the Partnership, as in effect
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of limited partnership of the Surviving Partnership, until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable
Law. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Amended
Partnership Agreement shall be the partnership agreement of the Surviving
Partnership, until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof and applicable Law.

as a result of the Company Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or any holder of securities of the Company or
Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Company Common Share Merger Consideratio_ _n_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Company Common
Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Company Common Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares (as defined below), if any) shall automatically
be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to Nineteen

any, shall cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) _Cancellation of Company Limited Voting Shares_. Each share of
limited voting stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (each, a "
_Company Limited Voting Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Company Limited
Voting Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

(d) _Merger Sub Membership Units_. Each limited liability company interest
in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of Class A common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Company.

 

4.2. _Redemption of Company Preferred Shares_. Immediately prior to the

Redemption Amount and (ii) immediately thereafter, the Partnership to redeem
each Partnership Series A Preferred Unit issued and outstanding at such time
for a cash amount equal to the Per Share Redemption Amount.

Effective Time, as a result of the Partnership Merger and without any action
on the part of the Partnership, Parent, the Surviving Company, Merger Sub or
any holder of securities of the Partnership or Merger Partnership:

 

(a) _Partnership Merger Consideration_. Each Partnership Common Unit held
by a Minority Limited Partner issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest (the " _Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ that, in lieu of
receiving the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, if but only if (x)
the holder of such Partnership Common Unit has effectively made and not
revoked a valid election pursuant to Section 4.3(b) to receive a New
Partnership Preferred Unit in respect thereof, and (y) the issuance of such
New Partnership Preferred Unit would be exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and applicable
state securities laws, then each Partnership Common Unit of such holder shall
be converted into the right to receive one fully paid New Partnership
Preferred Unit, without interest. The aggregate amount of cash payable as the
Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration and such New Partnership Preferred
Units issued pursuant to this Section 4.3(a) are hereinafter referred to as
the " _Partnership Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ".

 

(b) _Unit Electio_ _n_. Subject to Section 4.3(b)(iv) and in accordance
with Section 4.3(a), each eligible holder of Partnership Common Units shall
be entitled, with respect to all, but not less than all, of such holders
Partnership Common Units, to make an unconditional election, on or prior to
the Election Date, to receive in the Partnership Merger, in lieu of the Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration for each such Partnership Common Unit to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled in accordance with Section
4.3(a), New Partnership Preferred Units (a " _Unit Election_ ") as follows:

(i) Merger Partnership shall prepare and deliver to the Partnership, as
promptly as practicable following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and, in any event, not later than five (5)
business days after the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, and the Partnership shall mail to the eligible
holders of Partnership Common Units, a form of election, which form shall be
subject to the reasonable review and approval of the Company (the " _Form
of Election_ "). The Form of Election may be used by each eligible holder of
Partnership Common Units to designate such holders election to convert all,
but not less than all, of the Partnership Common Units held by such
holder into New Partnership Preferred Units in the Partnership Merger. Any
such holders election to receive New Partnership Preferred Units shall be
deemed to have been properly made only if Parent shall have received at the
notices address set forth in Section 9.6, not later

 



8  than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is five (5) business
days before the scheduled date of the Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election
Date_ "), a Form of Election specifying that such holder elects to receive
New Partnership Preferred Units and otherwise properly completed and signed.
The Form of Election shall state therein the date that constitutes the
Election Date.

 

(ii) A Form of Election may be revoked by any holder of a Partnership
Common Unit only by written notice received by Parent at the address set
forth in Section 9.6 prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election
Date. In addition, all Forms of Election shall automatically be revoked if the
Partnership Merger has been abandoned.

 

(iii) The reasonable determination of Parent shall be binding as to whether
or not elections to receive New Partnership Preferred Units have been
properly made or revoked. If Parent determines that any election to receive
New Partnership Preferred Units was not properly made, Parent shall notify
such holder of Partnership Common Units of the improper election and provide
a reasonable opportunity to such holder to cure the improper election. If,
following such reasonable period, the improperly made election remains
uncured, the Partnership Common Units with respect to which such election was
not properly made shall be converted into Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 4.3(a). Parent may, with the consent
of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make such rules as are consistent with this Section 4.3(b) for the
implementation of elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or
desirable to fully effect such elections.

 

(iv) Each holder of Partnership Common Units, as a condition to making a
Unit Election with respect to such holders Partnership Common Units, shall
(x) represent to Parent that such holder is an Accredited Investor (as such
term is defined under Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act) and (y)
agree to be bound by the terms of the Amended Partnership Agreement,
including, without limitation, the power of attorney granted in Section 2.4
thereof, and (z) comply with any withholding certifications in order to
establish that no U.S. tax withholding is required on such transaction.

(v) The Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 5.1(a)) agree
to reasonably cooperate with Parent in preparing any disclosure statement or
other disclosure information to accompany the Form of Election, including
information applicable to an offering of securities exempt from registration
under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 506 thereunder, each of which shall
be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company.

 

(vi) Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Partnership shall deliver to each holder of Partnership Common Units entitled
to receive New Partnership Preferred Units pursuant to the terms of

 



9  Sections 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) a notice confirming such holders right to
receive the New Partnership Preferred Units issuable pursuant hereto in
respect of such Partnership Common Units.

 

(vii) Each Person that receives New Partnership Preferred Units pursuant to
the terms of Sections 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) shall be deemed to have made a
capital contribution to the Surviving Partnership and shall automatically be
admitted as a limited partner of the Surviving Partnership at the Partnership
Merger Effective Time.

 

(c) _Surviving Partnership Capitalization_. Each Partnership Common Unit
held by the Surviving Company immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Partnership Merger, shall remain
outstanding as a Partnership Common Unit of the Surviving Partnership held by
the Surviving Company and the Surviving Company shall continue as a limited
partner of the Surviving Partnership. The Roll-Over Limited Partners shall own
the number of New Partnership Preferred Units issued to them in the
Partnership Merger. The general partner interests of the Partnership
outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time and
owned by Partnership GP shall remain outstanding as general partner interests
of the Surviving Partnership, entitling Partnership GP to such rights, duties
and obligations as are more fully set forth in the Amended Partnership
Agreement. The Surviving Partnership shall be continued without dissolution
following the Partnership Merger.

 

(d) _Partnership Interests in Merger Partnership_. Each partnership
interest in Merger Partnership shall automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist, the holders thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

4.4. _Exchange of Certificates_ _; Paying Agent_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company
to act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for (i) the payment or
exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE IV of the Merger Consideration (other
than any New Partnership Preferred Units to be issued in accordance with
ARTICLE IV pursuant to the Unit Election) and (ii) if Parent wishes the Paying
Agent to so act, in Parents discretion, the exchange of Partnership Common
Units for New Partnership Preferred Units in accordance with this ARTICLE IV
pursuant to the Unit Election (the cash portion of the Merger Consideration
and, if so elected by Parent, any such New Partnership Preferred Units being
referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). On or before the Company
Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Shares, Cash-Out Limited Partners and Roll-Over Limited Partners, as
applicable; _provided_ that the aggregate amount of the Company Option
Payments, the Company RSU Payments and the Company

 



10  PSU Payments shall be deposited with the Payroll Company in accordance with
Section 4.9(d). The Company shall have the opportunity prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time to review an account balance of the Exchange Fund to
confirm that Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership have sufficient funds
for the Closing. The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of
Merger. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and the Paying Agent to
facilitate an orderly transfer of funds. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on cash deposited in the
Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Share and Unit Transfer Book_ _s_. On the Closing Date, the share
transfer books of the Company and the unit transfer books of the Partnership
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units. From and
after the Closing Date, the holders of certificates representing Partnership
Common Units (each such certificate, a " _Certificate_ ") or any book-entry
shares representing Company Common Shares (" _Book Entry Shares_ "), in each
case, outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or
Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, shall cease to have rights
with respect to such shares or units, as applicable, except as otherwise
provided for herein. On or after the Closing Date, any Book Entry Shares or
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or the
Surviving Partnership in accordance with this Agreement shall be exchanged for
the Per Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration
or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, with respect to the Company
Common Shares or Partnership Common Units formerly represented thereby.

 

4.5. _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Procedure_.

 

(i) As soon as possible after the Closing Date (but in any event within
five (5) business days), Parent and the Surviving Company shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay, by mail or by wire transfer, to each holder of Book Entry
Shares as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time the Per
Share Merger Consideration for each Company Common Share formerly represented
by such Book Entry Shares, automatically without any action on the part of
such holder or delivery of any certificate, letter of transmittal or other
evidence to the Paying Agent, and upon payment thereof such Book Entry Shares
shall be forthwith cancelled and have no further force or effect.

(ii) As soon as possible after the Closing Date (but in any event within
five (5) business days), the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that,
immediately 

 



11  prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, represented Partnership
Common Units whose units were converted into the right to receive or be
exchanged for the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New
Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4.3: (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the
Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as
applicable, to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as
applicable, payable in respect of the Partnership Common Units, as
applicable, previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this ARTICLE IV, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Partnership Common Units to a Person that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Partnership, payment may be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(iii) Each Certificate and each Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Closing Date to represent only the right to receive (with
respect to each Certificate, upon surrender thereof), the Per Share Merger
Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership
Preferred Units, as applicable, as contemplated by this Article IV. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable hereunder for any Book
Entry Share or Certificate.

 

(b) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Shares or
Partnership Common Units_. At the Company Merger Effective Time or the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, holders of Company Common
Shares or Partnership Common Units (that are converted into the right to
receive Per Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units) shall cease to be, and shall
have no rights as, stockholders of the Company or limited partners of the
Partnership other than the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership
Preferred Units, as applicable, provided under this ARTICLE IV. The Per Share
Merger Consideration, Per

 



12  Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as
applicable, paid or delivered for Book Entry Shares representing Company
Common Shares or upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing
Partnership Common Units, in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE IV,
shall be deemed to have been paid or delivered, as the case may be, in full
satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company Common
Shares or Partnership Common Units represented thereby or exchanged therefor.

 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fun_ _d_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book Entry
Shares for twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, shall be delivered to
the Surviving Company and any holders of Company Common Shares or Partnership
Common Units prior to the Company Merger or Partnership Merger, as
applicable, who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and only as general creditors
thereof for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership
Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable.

 

(d) _No Liabilit_ _y_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company,
the Partnership, Merger Partnership, the Surviving Partnership, the Company
or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or
Affiliate (as defined in Section 5.1(a)) thereof, shall be liable to any
Person in respect of Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of the Certificates or
Book Entry Shares immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 5.1(f)) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law
(as defined in Section 5.1(m)), become the property of the Surviving
Company, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or
their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " means a natural
person, partnership, corporation, real estate investment trust, limited
liability company, business trust, joint stock, company, trust, unincorporated
association, joint venture, Governmental Entity or other entity or
organization.

 

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. After the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the
Surviving Company, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company. Until the
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 4.5(c), to the extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Company
shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is,
at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

 



13 (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent (or,
if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section
4.5(c), the Surviving Company) will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New
Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, payable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

4.6. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment (and, with respect to the
Company RSUs and Company PSUs, the vesting of such Company RSUs and Company
PSUs) under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company, the
Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as applicable, and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying
Agent, as applicable.

 

4.7. _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Mergers.

4.8. _Adjustment of Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Partnership
Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units_. In the event that,
subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, the
Company Common Shares or Partnership Common Units issued and outstanding
shall, through a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the
capitalization of the Company or the Partnership, as applicable, increase or
decrease in number or be changed into or exchanged for a different kind or
number of securities, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall
be made to the Company Common Share Merger Consideration and the Partnership
Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in this
Section 4.8 shall be construed to supersede or in any way limit the
prohibitions set forth in Section 6.1 hereof.

 

4.9. _Treatment of_ _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Except as otherwise agreed between a holder of
an outstanding option to purchase Company Common Shares (a

 



14  " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plan (as defined in Section 5.1(d)(i))
and Parent, at the Company Merger Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Option under the Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically
and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder of such Company Option to
receive a lump sum amount in cash equal to (i) the product of (A) the total
number of Company Common Shares subject to the Company Option immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the excess, if
any, of (x) the sum of the Per Share Merger Consideration plus the per share
Pre-Closing Dividend over (y) the exercise price per Company Common Share
under such Company Option, less (ii) applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment (individually, the " _Company Option Payment_ "
and, collectively payable to all holders of Company Options, the " _Company
Option Payments_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option which has
an exercise price per share of Company Common Share that is greater than or
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Company
Merger Effective Time in exchange for no consideration or payment.

 

(b) _Company RSUs_. At the Company Merger Effective Time, (i) any vesting
conditions applicable to each outstanding time-based restricted stock unit (a
" _Company RSU_ ") under the Stock Plan, shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full, and all
restrictions with respect thereto shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, lapse, and (ii) each
Company RSU shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder
of such Company RSU to receive (without interest) a lump sum amount in cash
equal to (A) the product of (x) the number of Company Common Shares subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, plus (B) the value of
all dividend equivalents with respect to such Company RSUs, less (C)
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment (individually, the " _Company RSU Payment_ " and, collectively
payable to all holders of Company RSUs, the " _Company RSU Payments_ ").

 

(c) _Company PSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed between a holder of an
outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit (a " _Company PSU_ ")
under the Stock Plan and Parent, at the Company Merger Effective Time, (i) any
vesting conditions applicable to each Company PSU under the Stock Plan shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, accelerate based on the greater of (A) deemed achievement of target
performance or (B) actual performance (where the applicable performance goals
are pro-rated through the Company Merger Effective Time), in each case, in
accordance with and not to exceed the maximum number of Company PSUs that may
vest based on performance as provided in the applicable Company PSU award
agreement, and all restrictions with respect thereto shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, lapse, and (ii)
each Company PSU shall, automatically and without any required action

 



15  on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled in exchange for the right of
the holder of such Company PSU to receive (without interest) a lump sum amount
in cash equal to (A) the product of (x) the number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time (after taking into account the vesting in Section 4.9(c)(i)), multiplied
by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, plus (B) the value of all dividend
equivalents with respect to such Company PSUs, less (C) applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment (individually, the "
_Company PSU Payment_ " and, collectively payable to all holders of Company
PSUs, the " _Company PSU Payments_ ").

(d) _Payroll Company_. At or before the Company Merger Effective Time,
the Company shall remit to or cause to be remitted to the company engaged by
the Company from time to time to provide payroll services (the " _Payroll
Company_ "), on behalf of the Surviving Company, the aggregate amount of the
Company Option Payments, the Company RSU Payments, and the Company PSU
Payments (the " _Equity Award Payments_ ") for the benefit of the holders of
Company Options, Company RSUs, and Company PSUs, as applicable, payable
pursuant to Section 4.9(a), 4.9(b), and 4.9(c). The Surviving Company shall
cause the Payroll Company to make the Company Option Payments, the Company RSU
Payments, and the Company PSU Payments through the Surviving Companys
payroll system as soon as reasonably practicable (and no later than five (5)
business days) following the Company Merger Effective Time to each holder of
Company Options, Company RSUs, and Company PSUs, as applicable.

(e) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including obtaining
any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Companys board of
directors or a committee thereof and, if appropriate, amending the terms of
the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")) that may be
necessary or required under the ESPP and applicable Laws to (A) ensure that no
purchase period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement, and (B) terminate the ESPP in its entirety at the Company Merger
Effective Time with no further rights granted or exercised under the ESPP
thereafter.

 

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
the Company and the Company Board shall adopt any resolutions and take any
actions that are reasonably necessary or desirable to (i) effectuate the
treatment of the Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs (the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to Section 4.9(a), 4.9(b), and 4.9(c);
(ii) effectuate the provisions of 4.9(e) and (z) cause the Stock Plans (other
than the ESPP) to terminate at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that from
and after the Company Merger Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company

 



16  will be required to deliver Company Common Shares or other capital stock of
the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity
Awards; _provided_ that the Company shall not be deemed to breach the
foregoing provision by any contrary actions or agreements between a holder of
a Company Option and Parent pursuant to Section 4.9(a) or between a holder of
a Company PSU and Parent pursuant to Section 4.9(c).

Adverse Effect; and

 

(H) a change in the price or trading volume of the Company Common Shares on
the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), _provided_ that the exception
in this clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any
change, effect, circumstance or development underlying such decline has
resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

_provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (B), (C), (D), (E) and
(F), such change, event, circumstance, occurrence or state of fact does not
disproportionately adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries compared
to other companies of similar size operating in the principal industry in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to any references to Company Material Adverse
Effect in the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1(f), the

(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or

faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of time
within which to file) all income Tax Returns (as defined below) and all other
material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them and all such filed
Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects; and (B) have
paid (or made adequate provision therefor in the financial statements of the
Company included in the Company Reports) all Taxes (as defined below) that are
required to be paid. As of the date of this Agreement, there are not pending
or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, any audits, examinations,
investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters. There
are not, to the Companys Knowledge, any unresolved questions or claims
concerning the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Tax liability that are

Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company
and has not been identified as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary, Taxable REIT
Subsidiary, or REIT on Section 5.1(r)(xxvii) of the Company Disclosure Letter
has been since its formation treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not as a
corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. Taking into account
all distributions to be made by the Company prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company will have distributed cash to its stockholders of
record for the portion of its taxable year that includes the Closing Date
ending at the Company Merger Effective Time that is no less than
the Companys REIT taxable income and net capital gain through the Company
Merger Effective Time (based on reasonable estimates agreed to in writing by
the Company and Parent); and the Company will not be subject to Tax under
Section 857(b) or 4981 of the Code in respect of such portion of the taxable

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. __ The Company agrees that, from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Company Merger Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE VIII, except
as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the directors, officers or senior employees of it or
its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall instruct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers,
senior employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any indication of interest, proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below); or

 



59 (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
(other than informing any Person of the provisions contained in this Section
6.2(a)) or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or
data to any Person with respect to, any indication of interest, proposal or
offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(iii) execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
term sheet, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other similar definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined
below)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may
terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any standstill
agreement (including any standstill provisions contained in any
confidentiality or other agreement) to which it or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives is a party.

 

(b) _Exceptions_. __ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company and its Representatives may (A) furnish, make available
or provide access to non-public information with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries to a Person who has made a  _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.2 if the
Company has received or receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms that, taken as a whole, are not less restrictive to the
other party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined
in Section 9.7), _provided_ that such Confidentiality Agreement need not
contain any standstill or similar provision prohibiting the making of
any Acquisition Proposal, it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement shall not include any term that would prevent the Company from
complying with its obligations under this Section 6.2 (any confidentiality
agreement satisfying the criteria of this clause (A) being referred to as an
" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and promptly (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours thereafter) makes available to Parent and Merger
Sub any such information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that the
Company or its Representatives provides to any such Person and that was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub; (B) engage or participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after having complied with Section
6.2(f), authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable or
propose to authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable
(publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal; if and only to the
extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or
(C) above, the Company Board determines in good 

 



60  faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable
Law, (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C), the Company
Board has determined in good faith based on the information then available and
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that
such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case
referred to in clause (C) above, the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal.

(c) _Notice_. _ _ The Company agrees that it will (A) promptly (and, in
any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if any indications of
interest, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are
received by, or any non-public information is requested in connection with a
potential Acquisition Proposal from, the Company or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions
of any indications of interest, proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements, redacted, if necessary, to remove the identity of the
Person making the proposal or offer), and (B) promptly (and, in any
event, within forty-eight (48) hours within the occurrence of such change)
notify Parent of any change to the financial and other material terms and
conditions of any such indications of interests, proposals or offers after the
making of such change. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may in any event have
discussions with any Person that has made an unsolicited indication of
interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal in order to clarify and understand the
terms and conditions of the indication of interest, proposal or offer made by
such Person and to determine whether such inquiry, proposal or offer
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) _Definitions_. __ For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any indication of interest, proposal or
offer with respect to any merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation,
dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company, the Partnership or the Operating Partnership, and (ii) any
acquisition by any Person resulting in, or any indication of interest,
proposal or offer which, if consummated would result in, any Person (or group
of Persons) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, of 20% or more of the total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company, or 20% or more of the
equity interests or general partner interests in the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership, or 20% or more of the consolidated total assets
(including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the
Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



61 " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that would result in any Person (or group of Persons)
becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the
assets of the Company (on a consolidated basis), of 50% or more of the total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the Company Board
has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisors, is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the
proposal, and, if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to
the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the time likely to be required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal).

 

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. __
Except as expressly permitted by Sections 6.2(b) and 6.2(f), the Company
Board shall not:

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Mergers,
(B) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (C)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or take any action or make any public announcement
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any of the actions described
in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this Section 6.2(e), a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "); or

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
compliance with Section 6.2(b)).

 

(f) _Change of Recommendation_. __ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time, but not after, the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company Board may make a Change of
Recommendation (x) following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal after the
execution of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of
this Section 6.2 and that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes
a Superior Proposal or (y) solely in response to a material
event, occurrence, development or state of facts or circumstances, not
related to an Acquisition Proposal, and that first occurred following the
execution of this Agreement and was neither known to, nor reasonably
foreseeable by, the Company Board prior to the

 



62  date of this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ "), in each case referred
to in clauses (x) and (y) above, only if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the directors
duties under applicable Law, and may also terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
Board shall not take such action unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have complied with its obligations under this Section
6.2 in all material respects;

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a "
_Determination Notice_ ") to Parent at least 72 hours in advance of taking
such actions (the " _Notice Period_ ") to the effect that the Company Board
intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the
circumstances giving rise to such proposed action, including, in the case
such action is proposed to be taken in connection with a Superior Proposal,
the information specified by Section 6.2(c) with respect to such Superior
Proposal, including a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements
with, and the identity of, the party making the Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iii) the Company shall have, and shall have caused its financial and legal
advisors to have, during the Notice Period, negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that
the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material terms of
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
Determination Notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 6.2(f)(iii) with respect to such new Determination Notice and the
revised Superior Proposal contemplated thereby, except that the Notice
Period commencing upon the delivery of such new Determination Notice shall be
reduced to 48 hours;

(iv) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
continue to be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law
(taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed in
writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination pursuant to clause
(iii) above); and

 

(v) in the event of a termination of this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.3 and paid the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section
8.5.

 



63 After twice complying with clause (iii) above with respect to any such
Superior Proposal, the Company and the Company Board shall have no further
obligations under clause (iii) with respect to any such Superior Proposal and
the Company Board shall not be required to comply with such obligations with
respect to any such Superior Proposal.

(g) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), or making a statement contemplated by Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , that in no event shall this _Section 6.2(g)_ affect
the obligations of the Company specified in _Section 6.2(b)_ ; and _provided_
, _further_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
shall not be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation.

 

(h) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors will, and that it will
instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
employees and other Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the
individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2. The Company also agrees that
it will promptly request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries theretofore furnished
to any such Person with whom a confidentiality agreement was entered into at
any time in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement and
shall cease providing any further information to any such Person or its
Representatives and terminate all access granted to any such Person and its
Representatives to any physical or electronic data room.

6.3. _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within thirty
(30) days after the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary
form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4) (such
proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") and, subject to Section 6.2, shall include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall
provide the other with the information contemplated by Section 6.5(c) and
shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in connection
with any of the actions contemplated by this Section 6.3, including the
preparation, filing and 

 



64  distribution of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments in
respect thereof received from the SEC. The Company agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied by it or any
of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company and at
the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.3, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (i) provide Parent
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
and shall consider such comments in good faith and (ii) promptly provide
Parent with a copy of all such filings and responses made with the SEC. The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC
for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received in respect
of the Proxy Statement from the SEC and the Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than five (5)
business days) after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further
comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.
If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be
set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other party hereto,
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the Companys stockholders. 

6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all action
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of holders
of Company Common Shares and Company Limited Voting Shares (the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Requisite Company
Vote as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, and in
any event within fifty (50) days following clearance

 



65  of the Proxy Statement by the SEC. The Company shall, through the Company
Board, (i) recommend to holders of the Company Common Shares and Company
Limited Voting Shares that they give the Requisite Company Vote and (ii) use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit the Requisite Company Vote (including
by soliciting proxies from the Companys stockholders), except to the extent
that the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation, as
permitted by and determined in accordance with Section 6.2. The Company shall
keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by Parent. The Company shall not postpone or adjourn
the Stockholders Meeting except to the extent (1) Parent has consented to
such postponement or adjournment in writing, or (2) the Company, acting in
good faith after consulting with its outside legal counsel, determines that
(i) such postponement or adjournment is necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders
of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) (A) it will not receive proxies sufficient to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, or (B)
it will not have sufficient Company Common Shares and Company Limited Voting
Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting, or (iii) such
postponement or adjournment is required to comply with applicable Law;
_provided_ that in the case of any postponement or adjournment under clause
(ii) above, the date of the Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed or
adjourned by more than an aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar days other than
with Parents prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with ARTICLE VIII, the obligation of the Company to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting and mail the Proxy
Statement to the Companys stockholders shall not be affected by a Change of
Recommendation.

6.5. _Cooperation and Approvals_. (a)  _Cooperation_. __ Subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on their respective part under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event by or before the Termination Date, including
preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as
promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
waiting period expirations or terminations, permits and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
in the event Parent determines to obtain replacement financing in respect of
any indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent as necessary in
connection with the arrangement of such

 



66  replacement financing by Parent and its Affiliates as may be customary and
reasonably requested by Parent, including by using its reasonable best efforts
to obtain customary Lien terminations and releases, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Company Merger Effective Time, providing for the release
of any Lien imposed on any assets or equity securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the indebtedness being replaced;
_provided_ that Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives in connection with such cooperation and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses incurred by
them directly or indirectly in connection with any replacement financing,
except to the extent such losses arise from the intentional misconduct, gross
negligence or bad faith of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that no action shall be required
of the Company or its Subsidiaries if any such action shall: (i) unreasonably
disrupt or interfere with the business or ongoing operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; (ii) cause any representation or warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement to be breached unless such breach is waived by
Parent; (iii) require the Company or any Subsidiary to pay any commitment or
other fee prior to the Closing; (iv) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to incur any liability in connection with the replacement
financing prior to the Closing; or (v) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to approve or execute prior to the Closing any definitive
financing documents, including any credit or other agreements, pledge or
security documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents in
connection with the replacement financing. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with
the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement).
In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Party shall provide to the other (or the others
respective advisors) upon request copies of all correspondence between such
Party and any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under
this Section 6.5 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the Party
providing such materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable,
all discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a Governmental Entity
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall include
representatives of both Parties. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will
consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any analyses,
appearances,

 



67  presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted
to any Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by or on behalf of any Party. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any third party other than any Governmental Entity (each, a
" _Third Party Consent_ "), (i) without the prior written consent of Parent,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to
such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation
and (ii) none of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligations. In the event that the Company fails to obtain any Third
Party Consent, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize
any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Partnership and their respective businesses resulting, or which would
reasonably be expected to result, after the Company Merger Effective Time,
from the failure to obtain such Third Party Consent.

(b) _Information_. _ _ Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent
each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Mergers and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Party may designate information "for outside
counsel only" and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any Party may
redact commercially sensitive information related to the value of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the Party providing such materials.

 

(c) _Status_. __ Subject to applicable Laws and as required by any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including furnishing the other with copies of material
notices or other material communications received by Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except that any materials concerning one
Partys valuation of the other Party may be redacted.

 



68 (d) _Burdensome Condition_. __ Notwithstanding anything in this Section
6.5 to the contrary, the "reasonable best efforts" standard set forth in
Section 6.5(a) shall not (A) require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, any
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order that
would result in or impose a Burdensome Condition or (B) require Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to sell, lease, license or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate, or accept any terms, conditions, liabilities,
obligations or commitments with respect to, any of its or their assets or
businesses. A " _Burdensome Condition_ " shall mean any terms, conditions,
liabilities, obligations, commitments or sanctions imposed upon the Company or
its Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity that would be, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, business, properties, assets, liabilities or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

6.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent
and Merger Sub and their officers and other authorized Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice throughout the period prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, to
its employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish as
promptly as reasonably practicable to Parent and Merger Sub all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested, _provided_ that all such investigations shall be
reasonable in scope, and _provided_ , _further_ , that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company or its
Subsidiaries (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would (A) unreasonably disrupt
the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any obligations
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) to disclose
any information the disclosure of which would violate applicable Law, (iii)
to disclose any information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice (if the Company has used commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain permission or consent of such third party to such
disclosure) or (iv) to disclose any information subject to any attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege or would cause a risk
of loss of privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_
that, in each case, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
develop an alternative to providing such information reasonably acceptable to
Parent). All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall
be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the
Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



69 6.7. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Company of the
Company Common Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company
Common Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Company Merger Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days
after the Closing Date.

6.8. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Mergers shall
be a joint press release and thereafter (unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has occurred or in connection with Section 6.2(e)) the Company
and Parent each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making
any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service)
with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity. The Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment (with such comments being provided as promptly as
practicable) upon any communication to be broadly disseminated to the
Companys employees or department or division thereof, or any other
communication to the Companys employees that would be required to be filed
with the SEC, in each case relating to this Agreement, the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not make any
such communication prior to such consultation except as may be required by
applicable Law.

 

6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and any executive officer of
the Company in his or her individual capacity, Parent agrees that, during the
period commencing at the Company Merger Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is employed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") during the time that each such
Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
(i) at least the same base compensation and annual cash bonus opportunity
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time; (ii) severance benefits that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time; and (iii) other
compensation and employee benefits (excluding, for this purpose,
the compensation contemplated by clauses (i)-

 



70  (ii) above, equity-based compensation, and defined benefit pension plans,
post-retirement welfare plans, and retention, change in control or similar
plans, policies or agreements) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time.

 

(b) For purposes of any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (the " _New Plans_ ") providing benefits to any
Continuing Employees after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, (i) use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans;
and (B) provide each Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents under
any New Plan with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the
portion of the plan year of the corresponding Benefit Plan ending on the date
such Continuing Employees participation in the New Plan begins (to the same
extent that such credit was given under the analogous Benefit Plan prior to
the date that the Continuing Employee first participates in the New Plan) in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the
New Plan; and (ii) recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessors or affiliates thereof) (to
the same extent that such service was recognized under the analogous
Benefit Plan prior to the date that the Continuing Employee first
participates in the New Plan) for all purposes in any New Plan in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Company Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not apply
(A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits, or (B) for any
purpose with respect to any defined benefit pension plan or any postretirement
welfare plan.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended to (1) be treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan,
(2) prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates from
amending or terminating any of their benefit plans or, after the Company
Merger Effective Time, any Benefit Plan in accordance their terms, (3)
prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, after the
Company Merger Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any
Continuing Employee, or (4) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit
plan which Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates may
maintain.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.9(a), with respect to each
employee of the Company who is eligible to receive a cash bonus in accordance
with the terms of the applicable bonus plans of the Company or its

 



71  Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
(each, a " _Bonus Eligible Employee_ "), Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
to each Bonus Eligible Employee who is employed by Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries on the last day of the 2017 calendar year a bonus in respect of
the 2017 calendar year in accordance with the Companys applicable bonus plans
and historic practice.

 

6.10. _Expenses_. The Surviving Company shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in ARTICLE IV. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.5, whether or not the Mergers are consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense.

 

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company
agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Company Merger Effective
Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, penalties,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
actually or allegedly existing or occurring at or prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company
Merger Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under Maryland law and its certificate of incorporation or bylaws in
effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent or
the Surviving Company shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification);
and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Maryland law and the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws shall be made by independent counsel selected by the
Surviving Company.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving Company
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Company
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Company Merger Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving
Company shall have

 



72  the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Company
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Company elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Company and the Indemnified Parties,
the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the
Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Company shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel
for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, _provided_ that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and the
Surviving Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Company
shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

 

(c) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, and, if
the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the
Company Merger Effective Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancellable, irrevocable extension of (i) the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, (iii) the Companys existing insurance policy
with respect to employment practices liability insurance for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least three (3) years from and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, in each case from one or more insurance
carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (including in 

 



73  connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
by this Agreement). If the Company and the Surviving Company for any reason
fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least
six years from and after the Company Merger Effective Time the DandO Insurance
in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement,
or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company expend or Parent or the Surviving Company be required to
expend for such policies, pursuant to this Section 6.11(c), any premiums in
the aggregate in excess of an amount equal to 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance policies; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the aggregate annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Company or the Surviving Company, as the case may be,
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.11.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contract or Laws. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation,
certificate of formation or bylaws of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the
Company or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 



74 (g) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time until the third (3rd)
anniversary thereof, the organizational documents of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
any indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation rights
of individuals who were, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
directors, officers or employees of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company
or any of their predecessor entities, than are presently set forth in the
organizational documents of the Company and its applicable Subsidiary, and
the organizational documents of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not contain any provisions contradictory to such rights.

 

6.12. _Other Actions by the Company_.

 

(a) _Takeover Statutes_. __ If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

 

(b) _Section_ _ _ _16 Matters_. __ Prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, the Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to cause dispositions of Company Common Shares, Partnership Common
Units, Company Equity Awards, and any other equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.13. _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other Party of all
notices and other communications received by the Company or its Subsidiaries
or Parent, as applicable, from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, its Subsidiaries or Parent. Prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of all civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations,
investigations or other proceedings commenced or threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Board, or any committee
thereof, in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating
to the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Transaction Litigation_ ") (including by providing copies of all pleadings
with respect thereto) and thereafter keep Parent

 



75  reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
(a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and (b) consult with Parent with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation. For purposes of this Section 6.13, "participate" means that Parent
will be kept reasonably apprised of proposed strategy and other significant
decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel
is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments
or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation which the Company
shall consider in good faith, but Parent will not be afforded any decision
making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation; _provided_
that no settlement shall be offered or entered into or payment made without
the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

6.14. _Restrictions on Dividends; Pre-Closing Dividend_. After the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, upon
consultation with Parent, the Company shall make distributions reasonably
required for the Company to maintain its status as a REIT under the Code or to
avoid (based on reasonable estimates agreed to in writing by the Company and
Parent) the deemed liability for income or excise tax under Sections 857 or
4981 of the Code for taxable years of the Company ending prior to or deemed to
end for these purposes at the Company Merger Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
no less than two (2) days prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, but not
prior to the first business day following October 7, 2017, the Company shall
declare and pay a cash dividend to the holders of record of Company Common
Shares on or before such date, in an amount equal to $4.00 per share or such
higher amount as may be necessary for the Company to distribute to its
stockholders no less than (based on reasonable estimates agreed to in writing
by the Company and Parent) the Companys undistributed REIT taxable income and
net capital gain earned or accrued by the Company for the portion of the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date ending at the Company Merger
Effective Time (the " _Pre-Closing Dividend_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to pay the Pre-Closing Dividend until all of
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII shall have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing). If the Pre-Closing Dividend exceeds $4.00 per share or if the
Company declares any other distribution on the Company Common Shares on
or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to (x) the amount by which
the Pre-Closing Dividend exceeds $4.00 per share and (y) the per Company
Common Share amount of any such other distribution. Parent shall cause
Company to report with respect to those distributions paid in that portion
prior to the Closing Date of the taxable year in which the Company Merger
occurs, including the Pre-Closing Dividend, as a "capital gain dividend"
(within the meaning of Section 857(b)(3) of the Code) to the maximum amount
permitted to be designated as such under such Section.



 



76 6.15. Taxes.

 

(a) _REIT Matters_. __ The Company shall take all actions, and refrain
from taking all actions, as are necessary to ensure that the Company (i) will
qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its
current taxable year and any other taxable year that includes the Closing
Date, _provided_ that, in the case of any taxable year that includes but does
not end on the Closing Date, any action by the Company or failures to act
relating to period or events that occur from and after the Company Merger
Effective Time shall not be considered to result in a breach of this covenant
or any representation or covenant of the Company in this Agreement with
respect to such tax year, and (ii) will not become liable for U.S. federal
income Tax under Section 857(b) or 4981 of the Code (based on reasonable
estimates agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent). After the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company
shall accommodate all reasonable requests of Parent with respect to
maintenance of the Companys REIT status for the Companys 2016 taxable year
(including with respect to the filing of the 2016 IRS Form 1120-REIT) and the
continuation of such REIT status of the 2017 taxable year and, if applicable,
any later taxable year of the Company that would include the Company Merger
Effective Time, _provided_ that, in the case of any taxable year that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date, any action by the Company or failures to
act relating to period or events that occur from and after the Company Merger
Effective Time shall not be considered to result in a breach of this covenant
or any representation or covenant of the Company in this Agreement with
respect to such tax year, assuming that the Company has complied in full with
its obligations under Section 6.14.

(b) _Mitigation of Taxes_. __ Parent and the Company shall, upon written
request, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement).

(c) _Tax Returns_. __ The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and timely file or cause to be timely filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions of time) all Tax Returns for the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company required to be filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions of time) for all taxable periods ending prior to the
Closing Date, including timely filing of Tax Returns for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 (taking into account any applicable extensions of time).
Parent shall cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company that are required to be filed for the taxable period
that includes the Closing Date and any other Tax Returns for the Company and
its Subsidiaries for which the due date for the filing of such returns
(determined taking into account any applicable extensions of time) has not
occurred prior to the Closing Date. Any such Tax Returns prepared by the
Company shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the historic Tax
accounting practices of the Company (except as may be required under
applicable Tax Law). The Company shall pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns. The Company shall provide to Parent copies of such Tax Returns that
are

 



77  to be filed by the Company for all taxable periods ending prior to the
Closing Date at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the due date of such
Tax Returns (including applicable extensions) and the Company shall consider
in good faith any and all reasonable comments of Parent with respect to such
Tax Returns; _provided_ that the incorporation of comments of Parent with
respect to such Tax Returns shall not be considered to result in a breach of
any representation or covenant of the Company in this Agreement with respect
to such Tax Returns.

 

(d) _FIRPTA Certificate_. __ On the Closing Date, prior to the Partnership
Merger, the Partnership shall deliver to Parent a duly executed certificate
of non-foreign status from each Person that constitutes and is treated as a
partner (and is not a disregarded entity) for U.S. federal income tax and that
has provided such a certificate to the Partnership. The receipt of such
certificates by Parent shall not be a condition to the Partnership Merger, but
if Parent has not received such certificate from or with respect to a partner,
Parent shall be entitled to withhold any applicable U.S. tax on cash
distributed to or on behalf of such Person (as determined by Parent in its
sole discretion).

 

(e) _Cousins Tax Matters Agreement_. Each of the Company and the
Partnership acknowledge that it was a party to the Tax Matters Agreement. To
the extent received by the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy
of any statements prepared pursuant to or in accordance with Section 2.02(c)
of the Tax Matters Agreement relating to the gain proposed to be recognized
by Cousins with respect to each asset deemed contributed to the Company in the
Cousins Section 351 Transfers (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement),
together with the resulting adjusted tax basis to the Company of each such
asset, including any subsequent modifications to such statements.

6.16. _Syndication_. Parent may, at or prior to the Closing, allocate a
portion of its commitment to fund the cash portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration to one or more potential equity financing sources, _provided_
that Parent will remain responsible for all of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof (including,
without limitation, the funding of the cash portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration), regardless of whether such obligations have been syndicated
in accordance with the foregoing (the " _Syndication_ "). In the event Parent
determines to proceed with the Syndication, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent as necessary in
connection with the arrangement of such Syndication as may be customary and
reasonably requested by Parent, including by: (i) providing Parents potential
equity financing sources in the Syndication (including investors in
funds, vehicles or accounts that are managed, sponsored or advised by such
potential equity financing sources) with access to information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiary as may be
customary and reasonably requested by Parent, subject in each case to
customary confidentiality commitments from such potential equity financing
sources in the Syndication; (ii) participating in, and assisting with,
marketing efforts relating to such Syndication, including providing
information within its control that is reasonably

 



78  requested by Parent for assisting in the preparation of customary
confidential information memoranda and other customary private offering
documents and marketing materials; (iii) attending and participating in due
diligence sessions and meetings with prospective investors, in each case, at
such times as coordinated reasonably in advance thereof; (iv) delivery of
financial information reasonably requested by Parent and customary
or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Syndication, including in
connection with the preparation of customary confidential information
memoranda and other customary private offering or information documents to be
used for such Syndication (which financial information, for the avoidance of
doubt, may be included in any such confidential information memoranda, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda and other offering or
information documents used for or distributed in connection with the
Syndication); and (v) directing its independent auditors to reasonably
cooperate with such Syndication consistent with their customary practice.
Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with such
cooperation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.16 or
any other provision of this Agreement, (A) no action shall be required of the
Company or its Subsidiaries if any such action shall (i) unreasonably disrupt
or interfere with the business or ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; or (ii) cause any representation or warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement to be breached unless such breach is waived by
Parent, (B) prior to the Closing, none of the Company, the Partnership and any
of the Companys Subsidiaries shall have any responsibility for, or incur any
liability to any Person under or in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by the Syndication, (C) none of the Company, the Partnership or
any of the Companys Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action (I)
under, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by, any agreement,
certificate, document or instrument relating to the Syndication that is not
contingent upon the Closing Date (including the entry into any agreement that
is effective before the Closing Date), (II) that would reasonably be expected
to cause any trustee, director, officer or employee of the Company, the
Partnership or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to incur any personal
liability relating to the Syndication, (III) that will conflict with or
violate its organizational documents or any applicable Laws, or (IV) that
would cause any condition to the Closing to fail to be satisfied or otherwise
cause any material breach of this Agreement (unless such breach is waived by
Parent), (C) the Company Board, the Partnership and any of the Companys
Subsidiaries shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the
agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the Syndication
is obtained, (D) none of the Company, Partnership and any of the Companys
Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any definitive certificates, legal
opinions or documents in connection with the Syndication that are effective
prior to the Closing, and (E) none of the Company, Partnership and any of the
Companys Subsidiaries shall be required to take any corporate actions that
are effective prior to the Closing to permit the consummation of the
Syndication.

actions necessary to, complete the restructuring transactions set forth in
_Exhibit C_ hereto (the " _Pre-Closing Restructuring_ ") immediately prior to

Closing Restructuring transactions shall be contingent upon the receipt by
the Company of a written notice from Parent confirming that all of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than Section 7.2(d) and
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing) have been satisfied (or, at the option of Parent, waived) and that
Parent is prepared to proceed with the Closing immediately following the
consummation of the Pre-Closing Restructuring. None of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the Pre-Closing
Restructuring transactions contemplated by this Section 6.17. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries
in performing their obligations under this Section 6.17, and indemnify the
Company for any and all losses incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries arising therefrom (except to the extent any such losses arise
from the willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith of the Company).

 

(b) In the event that Parent provides notice to the Company pursuant to
_Exhibit C_ that Parent desires to modify the Pre-Closing Restructuring and
Parent and the Company agree on a modified Pre-Closing Restructuring (a "
_Modified Pre-Closing Restructuring_ "), then the Parties hereby agree that,
in addition to the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) above, (i) the
Modified Pre-Closing Restructuring shall be implemented as close as possible
to the Company Merger Effective Time (without jeopardizing the purpose of the
Modified Pre-Closing Restructuring, but, in any event, after Parent and
Merger Sub shall have waived or confirmed that all conditions to the
consummation of the Company Merger have been satisfied or waived (other than
Section 7.2(d) and other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing), (ii) neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall be required to take any action in contravention of any Laws or any
Organizational Documents or any other contract or agreement to which the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets are
bound, (iii) the Modified Pre-Closing Restructuring (or the inability to
complete the Modified Pre-Closing Restructuring) shall not affect or modify in
any respect the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement,
(iv) neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to take any
such action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
classification of Company as a REIT, and (v) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary shall be required to take any such action that would
reasonably be expected to result in any Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse
Tax consequences to, any stockholder or other equity interest holder of
Company or the Partnership, or other adverse consequences to the stockholders
or equity holders of Company as a whole, incrementally greater than the Taxes
or other adverse

 



80  consequences to such Person in connection with the consummation of this
Agreement in the absence of such action taken pursuant to this Section
6.17(b), unless such holders are indemnified by Parent for such incremental
Taxes. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the representations, warranties
or covenants of Company or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed to apply to,
or deemed breached or violated by, the Modified Pre-Closing Restructuring.

the time of such termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(a) shall not have been met) or Section 8.2(b) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b) ( _provided_ in each case that, at the time
of such termination, the Company Board shall not have made and not withdrawn
a Change of Recommendation) and

(A) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal (x) shall have been made to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders, (y) shall have
been publicly announced and (z) shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior
to the date of the event giving rise to the applicable right of termination,
and

(B) within twelve (12) months of such termination, (x) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement for an
Acquisition Proposal or (y) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
consummated transaction of the type set forth in the definition
of "Acquisition Proposal" and, in each case, such Acquisition Proposal would
qualify as an Acquisition Proposal if all references to "20% or more" were
replaced with "50% or more", then promptly after the consummation of such
Acquisition Proposal, but in no event later than three (3) business days after
such consummation, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the
excess of (x) a termination fee of $26,400,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ")
over (y) any Expense Fee previously paid;

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a), then immediately prior to
such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee; or

 

(iv) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) and, at the time of such
termination, the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) shall not have been
met, then promptly, but in no event later than three (3) business days, after
the date of such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination
Fee.

 

Any payments made to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.5(b) shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent. In no event shall the Company be required to pay both the Termination
Fee, on the one hand, and the Expense Fee, on the other hand or be required to
pay any of the Termination Fee or the Expense Fee on more than one occasion.

 



86 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section
8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Partnership would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(b), and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the fee
set forth in Section 8.5(b) or any portion of such fee, the Company shall pay
to Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the fee at the U.S. prime rate as shown on the Bloomberg screen
BTMM or PRIME INDEX HP, whichever is higher, in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or
willful and material breach of this Agreement by the Company, in the event
that the Termination Fee or the Expense Fee, as the case may be, is payable
and actually paid to Parent in accordance with this Section 8.5, the payment
of such Termination Fee or Expense Fee and the amounts described in the first
sentence of this Section 8.5(c) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Partnership and their respective Affiliates against
the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or
future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other
Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
covenant, representation and warranty or other agreement in relation to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or the failure of the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership contained in ARTICLE
IV and Sections 6.9 (Employee Benefits), 6.10 (Expenses) and 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) shall survive the
consummation of the Mergers. This ARTICLE IX and the agreements of the
Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership contained
in Section 6.10 (Expenses) and Section 8.5 (Effect of Termination and
Abandonment) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination

applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement
executed and delivered by duly authorized representatives of the respective
Parties.

 

9.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the Parties
obligations to consummate the Mergers are for the sole benefit of such Party
and may be waived by such Party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights
hereunder or under applicable Law shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no single or
partial exercise by any Party of any of its rights hereunder precludes any
other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights hereunder
or under applicable Law.

9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into
in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by email delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person.

 

9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL
BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF
THE STATE OF MARYLAND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER
JURISDICTION, except that (i) the provisions of the DLLCA and the MGCL
applicable to the authorization, effectiveness and effects of the Company
Merger and the provisions of the DRULPA applicable to the authorization,
effectiveness and effects of the Partnership Merger will apply to the
Company Merger and the Partnership Merger and (ii) the applicable Law of the
State of Delaware shall apply to the discharge of the fiduciary duties of the
Partnership GP in connection with this Agreement. The Parties hereby
irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Maryland or, if such courts shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the
federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Maryland, solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of (and any claim or cause of action arising under or relating to)
this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the transactions contemplated 

 



88  hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of
any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit
or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, proceeding or
transactions shall be heard and determined in such courts. The Parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
Parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such
dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.6 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE THIRD PARTY FINANCING). EACH
PARTY HEREBY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

(c) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate this Agreement, including the Parties obligations to
consummate the Mergers and the obligation of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger
Partnership to pay, and the right of the holders of Company Common Shares and
Partnership Common Units to receive, the Merger Consideration) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or
threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof.

 



89 (d) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the rights to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedy contemplated herein are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
such right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. The
Parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any party, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of any party under this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or
enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security. The Parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this Section 9.5, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this Section 9.5 are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 9.5
shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
9.5 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under ARTICLE
VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement
of any legal proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.5 or anything set forth in
this Section 9.5 restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of ARTICLE VIII or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 

9.6. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto),
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Voting and Support Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 1, 2017, between Parent and the Company
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the Parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. No party shall be bound by, or be liable for, any
alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not
contained herein.

 



91 9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent, Merger Sub
and Merger Partnership, on the one hand, and the Company and the Partnership,
on the other hand, hereby agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other Parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon
any Person other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including, without limitation, the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The Parties hereto further agree that the rights
of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and
until the Company Merger Effective Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto. Any inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties
hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Company Merger Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Mergers shall be paid by Parent, Merger Sub
and Merger Partnership when due, and Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership
will indemnify the Company against liability for any such Taxes.

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to
any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) the Parties
hereto shall negotiate, in good faith, a suitable and

 



92  equitable provision that shall be substituted therefor in order to carry
out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such
invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision, or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation."

(a) The words " _hereof_ ," " _herein_ " and " _hereunder_ " and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) The rule known as the _ejusdem generis_ rule shall not apply, and,
accordingly, general words introduced by the word "other" shall not be given a
restrictive meaning by reason of the fact that they are preceded by words
indicating a particular class of acts, matters or things.

 

(d) Each Party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in
its respective Disclosure Letter in a section of such Disclosure Letter that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement.

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect
subsidiary to be a constituent company in the Mergers in lieu of Merger Sub
and Merger Partnership, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub and
Merger Partnership, respectively, shall be deemed references to such other
subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub and Merger Partnership, respectively, as of the date of
this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with
respect to such

 



93  other subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any
such designation shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit Parent from transferring all or part of its ownership interests in
Merger Sub or Merger Partnership to any controlled Affiliate of Parent. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.
