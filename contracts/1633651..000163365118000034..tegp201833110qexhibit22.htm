provided to the Financial Advisor by Development and its Affiliates as part of
the Conflicts Committee's review in connection with this Agreement, were

authorizations issued or granted or waived by Governmental Authorities that

liabilities or obligations of Development or Tallgrass Holdco of any nature

or the Development Assets with respect to any taxable period or portion
thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that, such liability
shall be allocated to Holdings and the Development Limited Partners by
reference to their respective ownership interests in Development, Applicable
Law, and the applicable allocation provisions in the Development LP Agreement,
at the relevant time.

beginning before and ending after the Closing Date which is allocable to the
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the determination shall be
made, in the case of property or ad valorem taxes or franchise taxes (which
are measured by, or based solely upon capital, debt or a combination of
capital and debt), by pro rating such Taxes ratably on a per diem basis and,
in the case of other Taxes, by assuming that such partial period constitutes a

period (except that exemptions, allowances and deductions for a taxable period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date that are calculated on an
annual or periodic basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be

taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise tax.

timely payment of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by such Tax
Return provided that TE shall have a right to recover from Holdings the amount
of Taxes attributable to the portion of the taxable period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date pursuant to Section 5.2(a)). 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Except with respect to Tax Returns applicable to REX or TEP, with regard to
any Tax Return not yet filed for any taxable period that begins before the

parties shall cause each such Tax Return to be prepared in accordance with
past Tax accounting practices used with respect to the Tax Returns in question
(unless such past practices are no longer permissible under the Applicable
Law), and to the extent any items are not covered by past practices, in

|

The parties agree to treat any allocable assumed liability as a "qualified

inconsistent with the allocations and determinations described in this Section

as received pursuant to a sale pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.707-3, the parties shall cooperate to prepare an allocation of the allocable
assumed liabilities among the various classes of the Development Assets in
accordance with and as provided by Section 1060 of the Code. The parties agree
that, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, any Tax Returns or other tax information they may file or cause to be filed with any Government
Authority shall be prepared and filed consistently with any such agreed upon
allocation. The parties agree that, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
they will each properly prepare and timely file Form 8594 in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code.

Affiliate of TE shall (i) make or change any Tax election, (ii) file any
amended Tax Return to the extent relating to any taxable period, or portion
thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date, (iii) take any action or omit
to take any action, or (iv) extend the statute of limitations for any Tax
Return relating to any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before
the Closing Date which in each case of (i), (ii), and (iii), (x) is
inconsistent with past tax accounting practices of Development (unless such
past practices are no longer permissible under Applicable Law), and to the
extent any items are not covered by past practices (or in the event such past
practices are no longer permissible under Applicable Law), in accordance with
reasonable tax accounting practices and (y) results in (I) increasing the
liability of Holdings or any Development Limited Partner or any Affiliate
thereof for Taxes or (II) the shifting of (a) income from a taxable period or
portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date to a taxable period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date or (b) deductions from a
taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date to a
taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE VI 
INDEMNIFICATION

Section 6.1 Indemnification of the Partnership.

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, Holdings, from and
after the Closing Date, shall indemnify, defend and hold Merger Sub, TE and
the Partnership, their subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
and employees, and the officers, directors and employees of the General
Partner (the "Partnership Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any
and all Damages suffered or incurred by any Partnership Indemnified Party
relating to, as a result of, or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of
a representation or warranty of Development in this Agreement, (ii) any breach
of any agreement or covenant on the part of Development made under this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and/or
(iii) the Disclosed Liabilities. For purposes of this Section 6.1, whether
Development has breached any of its representations and warranties herein
shall be determined without giving effect to any qualification as to
"materiality" (including the word "material" or the term "Material Adverse
Effect").

Section 6.2 Indemnification of Development.

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, TE, from and after the
Closing Date, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Development Limited
Partners and Development General Partner and their respective securityholders,
directors, officers, and employees (the "Development Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by the
Development Indemnified Parties as a result of or arising out of (i) any
breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Partnership in
this Agreement, or (ii) any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of
the Partnership made under this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Section 6.2, whether
Merger Sub, TE or the Partnership has breached any of their representations
and warranties herein shall be determined without giving effect to any
qualification as to "materiality" (including the word "material" or the term
"Material Adverse Effect"). Section 6.3 Survival.

All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any
party hereto, provided that the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III and Article IV shall terminate and expire on the date that is
fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date, except (a) the representations
and warranties of Development set forth in Section 3.1 (Organization), Section
3.2 (Authority and Approval), Section 3.4 (Capitalization; Title to Assets),
Section 3.6 (Brokerage Arrangements), Section 3.7 (Conflicts Committee
Matters) and Section 3.11 (Matters Relating to Development) (collectively, the
"Fundamental Representations"), which shall survive forever; and (b) the
representations and warranties of the Partnership set forth in Section 4.1
(Organization and Existence), Section 4.2 (Authority and Approval) and Section
4.4 (Brokerage Arrangements), which shall survive forever. After a
representation and warranty has terminated and expired, no indemnification
shall or may be sought pursuant to this Article VI on the basis of that
representation and warranty by any Person who would have been entitled
pursuant to this Article VI to indemnification on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration, provided
that in the case of each representation and warranty that shall terminate and
expire as provided in this Section 6.3, no claim presented in writing for
indemnification pursuant to this Article VI on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration shall be
affected in any way by that termination and expiration. The indemnification
obligations under this Article VI or elsewhere in this Agreement shall apply
regardless of whether any suit or action results solely or in part from the
active, passive or concurrent negligence or strict liability of the
indemnified party.

Section 6.4 Demands.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its discovery of
facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of this
Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim,
action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such claims
for indemnity involving third-party claims being collectively referred to
herein as the "Third Party Indemnity Claim"), with respect to any matter as to
which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this
Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying
party, together with a statement of such information respecting any of the
foregoing as it shall have. Such notice shall include a formal demand for
indemnification under this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the indemnified party fails to notify the
indemnifying party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
in sufficient time to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend
against a Third Party Indemnity Claim and to make a timely response thereto,
the indemnifying party's indemnity obligation relating to such Third Party
Indemnity Claim shall not be relieved except in the event and only to the
extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced or damaged by such failure. 

Section 6.5 Right to Contest and Defend.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and expense, to contest
and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Third Party Indemnity
Claim for which it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified party under the
provisions of this Agreement; provided, that notice of the intention to so
contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party
within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of
notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the Third Party Indemnity
Claim. Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the
indemnifying party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such
contest shall be conducted by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying
party and not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the
indemnified party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate
in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at
its sole cost and expense. | 
---|--- 

(b)

|

The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine all action to be
taken with respect thereto; provided, however, that the indemnifying party
will not have the authority to subject the indemnified party to any obligation
whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or
obligations not involving material expense or injunctive relief. If the
indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such Third Party Indemnity
Claim, the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with
respect thereto by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Indemnity
Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms
obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in
connection with such Third Party Indemnity Claim, which releases the
indemnified party completely in connection with such Third Party Indemnity
Claim and which would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party as
determined by the indemnified party in its sole discretion. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party
in defending such Third Party Indemnity Claim) if the Third Party Indemnity
Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other
than money damages against the indemnified party which the indemnified party
reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be
separated from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief
or other relief portion of the Third Party Indemnity Claim can be so separated
from that for money damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages. 

Section 6.6 Cooperation.

If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any Third
Party Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the Third
Party Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the
indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and
its counsel in contesting any Third Party Indemnity Claim.

Section 6.7 Right to Participate.

The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Third Party
Indemnity Claim against the indemnified party or conferences with
representatives of or counsel for such Persons.

Section 6.8 Payment of Damages.

The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic payments of
the amount of Damages in connection therewith within ten (10) days as and when
reasonably specific bills are received by, or Damages are incurred and
reasonable evidence thereof is delivered to, the indemnifying party. In
calculating any amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by reason of the
provisions of this Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all insurance
proceeds and any indemnification reimbursement proceeds received from third
parties credited to or received by the indemnified party related to the
Damages.

Section 6.9 Direct Claim.

Any claim by an indemnified party with respect to any Damages which do not
result from a Third Party Indemnity Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted
by giving the indemnifying party reasonably prompt written notice thereof,
stating the nature of such claim in reasonable detail and indicating the
estimated amount, if practicable. The indemnifying party will have a period of
ninety (90) days from receipt of such Direct Claim within which to respond to such Direct Claim. If the indemnifying party does not respond within such
ninety (90) day period, the indemnifying party will be deemed to have accepted
such Direct Claim. If the indemnifying party rejects such Direct Claim, the
indemnified party will be free to seek enforcement of its rights to
indemnification under this Agreement.

Section 6.10 Limitations on Indemnification.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

To the extent that the Partnership Indemnified Parties would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to Section 6.1(i), Holdings
shall be liable only if (i) the Damages with respect to any individual claim
exceed $80,000 (the "Minimum Claim Amount") and (ii) the Damages for all
claims that exceed the Minimum Claim Amount exceed, in the aggregate,
$4,000,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), and then Holdings shall be liable only
for Damages to the extent of any excess over the Deductible Amount. In no
event shall Holdings's aggregate liability to the Partnership Indemnified
Parties under Section 6.1 exceed $40,000,000 (the "Ceiling Amount").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Minimum Claim Amount, the Deductible Amount
and the Ceiling Amount shall not apply to breaches or inaccuracies of
representations and warranties contained in the Fundamental Representations. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Additionally, neither TE nor Holdings will be liable as an indemnitor under
this Agreement for any consequential, incidental, special, indirect or
exemplary damages suffered or incurred by the indemnified party or parties
except to the extent resulting pursuant to Third Party Indemnity Claims. 

Section 6.11 Sole Remedy.

No party shall have liability under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby except as is provided in this Article VI (other than
claims or causes of action arising from fraud).

ARTICLE VII 
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 7.1 Acknowledgments.

Each party acknowledges that it has relied on the representations and
warranties of the other party expressly and specifically set forth in this
Agreement, including, in the case of Merger Sub, TE and the Partnership, the
Disclosure Schedule attached hereto. Such representations and warranties
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
parties hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the parties hereto understand, acknowledge and agree that all other

to any restriction on its operations or other burdensome condition which would
in any such case be material to its assets, liabilities or business in order
to obtain any consent or approval or other clearance required by this Section 7.3 Expenses.

Except as otherwise provided herein and regardless of whether the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, each party shall pay its own expenses
incident to this Agreement and all action taken in preparation for carrying
