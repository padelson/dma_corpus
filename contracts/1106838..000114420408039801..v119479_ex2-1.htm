(y) five  and one-half (5.5), _plus_   (B) the  lesser of (x) Closing NBV,
as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.10,  and  (y) $10,000,000,
_plus_   (C) the  Woodlake Amount, _plus_   (D) the  Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount (if any) to the extent that the Net  Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant to Section  2.8, is a
negative number, _minus_   (E) the  Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
(if any) to the extent that the Net  Working Capital Adjustment Amount, as
finally determined pursuant to Section  2.8, is a positive number, _minus_  
(F) the  Indebtedness Payoff Amount and (ii) the assumption of the Assumed 
Liabilities.

 

 

(b) At  the  Closing, an estimate of the Aggregate Purchase Price (the "
**Closing  Purchase Price** ")  shall  be delivered by Buyer as follows:
(i) by delivery to Sellers or the Escrow  Agent, in accordance with clauses
(i) through (iii) of Section 2.7(b) and  Section 2.7(c), of a combination of

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) No  later  than seven (7) business days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller Representative  shall deliver to Buyer a written notice setting forth

Capitalization Notice,  then (i) the number of Parent Shares to be issued to

Shares to be issued at Closing pursuant to  this  Section 2.3(d) shall be
applied _pro  rata_   to the  Closing Shares and the Escrow Shares, and any
corresponding decrease in the  aggregate principal amount of the Parent Notes
to be delivered at Closing  pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) shall be applied
_pro  rata_   to the  Closing Notes and the Escrow Notes.

Seller Representative  shall deliver to Buyer a written notice (the "
**Consideration  Notice** ")  setting forth (i) that portion of the Closing
Cash Amount to be paid to each  Seller, (ii) the number of Closing Shares
(after taking into account any  adjustment to the amount thereof as a result
of any Parent Share Shortfall)  to  be issued to each Seller and (iii) the
aggregate principal amount of Closing  Notes (after taking into account any
adjustment to the principal amount thereof  as a result of any Parent Share
Shortfall) to be issued to each  Seller.

 

 

(f) The  Closing Cash Amount, Closing Shares and Closing Notes to be
delivered to Sellers  at Closing shall be allocated among the Sellers by
Seller Representative as  set  forth in the Consideration Notice; provided,

Seller is an "accredited investor" (within the  meaning of Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D under the Securities Act) and (ii)  nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall constitute an "offer to sell" (within  the meaning of Section
2(a)(3) of the Securities Act) any Parent Securities  to  any Seller who is
not an "accredited investor."

Net  Working Capital Adjustment Amount and  Payment

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) The  " **Net  Working Capital Adjustment Amount** " (which  may be a
positive or negative number) will be equal to the amount determined  by 
subtracting the Closing Net Working Capital from the Target Net Working
Capital.  If the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is positive, Seller
Representative  shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay an amount in cash equal
to the Net Working  Capital Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to  an  account specified by Buyer; provided that in the
event that the amount to be  paid to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.8(a)
exceeds the available funds  remaining in the Purchase Price Escrow Account,
Seller Representative shall  pay  the amount of such shortfall by wire
transfer of immediately available funds  to  the account specified by Buyer.
If the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount  is  negative, Buyer shall pay
an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of  the  Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately available  funds to an
account specified by Seller Representative. Within thirty (30)  days  after
the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital becomes binding and 
conclusive on the parties, Seller Representative or Buyer, as the case may 
be,  shall make the wire transfer payment provided for in this Section 
2.8(a). Any  funds  paid by Buyer to Seller Representative pursuant to this
Section 2.8(a) shall  be  paid or delivered to Seller Representative for the

(b) " **Net  Working Capital** " as  of a  given date shall mean the
aggregate amount calculated by subtracting (i) the  current liabilities of
each Seller included in the Assumed Liabilities as of  that date from (ii)
the current assets of each Seller included in the Assets  as  of that date,
as determined on a tax basis. " **Target  Net Working Capital** " shall 
mean $2,200,000.

 

 

(c) Buyer,  in  consultation with Cherry, Baekert and Holland, LLP (the "

and consolidating, balance  sheet of Sellers as of 11:59 p.m. Dallas, Texas
time on the day immediately  preceding the Closing Date (the " **Closing 
Balance Sheet** ")  on the  same basis and applying the same accounting
principles, policies and practices  that were used in preparing the Interim
Balance Sheet. Buyer shall then  determine the Net Working Capital as of
11:59 p.m. Dallas, Texas time on the  day  immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the " **Closing  Net Working Capital** "),  the  calculation of which
shall be based upon the Closing Balance Sheet, using the  same methodology as
was used to calculate the Target Net Working Capital and  taking into account
any applicable adjustments reflected in the Audited  Financial Statements or
required by GAAP. Buyer shall deliver the Closing  Balance Sheet and their
determination of the Closing Net Working Capital to  Seller Representative
within sixty (60) days following the Closing  Date.

 

 

(d) If  within  thirty (30) days following delivery of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing  Net Working Capital calculation Seller Representative
has not given Buyer  written notice of Sellers' objection as to the Closing
Net Working Capital  calculation (which notice shall state the basis of
Sellers' objections), then  the Closing Net Working Capital calculated by
Buyer shall be binding and  conclusive on the parties and be used in
computing the Net Working Capital  Adjustment Amount.

 

 

(e) If  Seller  Representative duly gives Buyer such notice of objection,
and if Seller  Representative and Buyer fail to resolve the issues
outstanding with respect  to  the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation
of the Closing Net Working Capital  within thirty (30) days of Buyer's
receipt of an objection notice from Seller  Representative, Seller
Representative and Buyer shall submit the issues  remaining in dispute to an
accounting firm of national standing mutually agreed  to by Seller
Representative and Buyer (the " **Independent  Accountants** ")  for 
resolution applying the principles, policies and practices referred to in 
Section 2.8(c). If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountants for 
resolution, (i) Sellers and Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to 
the Independent Accountants such work papers and other documents and
information  relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accountants
may request  and  are available to that party or its agents and shall be
afforded the opportunity  to present to the Independent Accountants any
material relating to the disputed  issues and to discuss the issues with the
Independent Accountants; (ii) the  determination by the Independent
Accountants, as set forth in a notice to be  delivered to both Seller
Representative and Buyer within sixty (60) days of  the  submission to the
Independent Accountants of the issues remaining in dispute,  shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties and shall be used in  the  calculation
of the Closing Net Working Capital; and (iii) the fees and  costs of the
Independent Accountants will be allocated to be paid by Buyer,  on  the one
hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which  the 
portion of the contested amount now awarded to each party bears to the
amount  actually contested by such party, as determined by the Independent 
Accountants.

2.10(b). Buyer shall then  determine the EBITDA as of as of 11:59 p.m.
Dallas, Texas time on the Period  End  Date (the " **Closing  EBITDA** ") 
, the  calculation of which shall be based upon the Closing Financial
Statements,  using  the same methodology as was used to calculate the

Consents;  Maintenance of Liquor Licenses

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) If  there  are any Material Consents that have not yet been obtained (or
otherwise are  not  in full force and effect) as of the Closing, in the case
of each Seller Contract  as to which such Material Consents were not obtained
(or otherwise are not  in  full force and effect) (the " **Restricted 
Material Contracts** "),  Buyer  may waive the closing conditions as to any
such Material Consent and  either:

 

 

(i) elect  to  have Sellers continue their efforts to obtain the Material
Consents;  or

 

 

(ii) elect  to  have Sellers retain that Restricted Material Contract and
all Liabilities  arising therefrom or relating thereto.

 

 

If  Buyer  elects to have Sellers continue their efforts to obtain any
Material Consents  and the Closing occurs, notwithstanding Sections 2.1 and
2.4, neither this  Agreement nor the Assignment and Assumption Agreements nor
any other document  related to the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions shall constitute  a  sale, assignment, assumption, transfer,
conveyance or delivery or an attempted  sale, assignment, assumption,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of the Restricted  Material Contracts, and
following the Closing, the parties shall use  commercially reasonable
efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain the  Material Consent
relating to each Restricted Material Contract as quickly as  practicable.
Pending the obtaining of such Material Consents relating to any  Restricted
Material Contract, the parties shall cooperate with each other in  any 
reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to Buyer the benefits 
of  use of the Restricted Material Contract for its term (or any right or
benefit  arising thereunder, including the enforcement for the benefit of
Buyer of any  and all rights of Sellers against a Third Party thereunder),
subject to Buyer's  responsibility for the obligations related thereto. Once
a Material Consent  for  the sale, assignment, assumption, transfer,
conveyance and delivery of a  Restricted Material Contract is obtained,
Sellers shall promptly assign,  transfer, convey and deliver such Restricted
Material Contract to Buyer, and  Buyer shall assume the obligations under
such Restricted Material Contract  assigned to Buyer from and after the date
of assignment to Buyer pursuant to  a  special-purpose assignment and
assumption agreement substantially similar in  terms to those of the
Assignment and Assumption Agreements (which  special-purpose agreement the
parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in  good  faith at the time of
such transfer, all at no additional cost to  Buyer).

 

 

(b) If  there  are any Consents not listed on Part 7.3 necessary for the
assignment and  transfer of any Seller Contracts to Buyer (the "
**Nonmaterial  Consents** ")  which  have not yet been obtained (or
otherwise are not in full force and effect)  as of  the Closing, Buyer shall
elect at the Closing, in the case of each of the Seller  Contracts as to
which such Nonmaterial Consents were not obtained (or otherwise  are not in
full force and effect) (the " **Restricted  Nonmaterial Contracts** "), 
whether to:

 

 

(i) accept  the assignment of such Restricted Nonmaterial Contract, in which
case, as  between Buyer and Sellers, such Restricted Nonmaterial Contract
shall, to the  maximum extent practicable and notwithstanding the failure to
obtain the  applicable Nonmaterial Consent, be transferred at the Closing
pursuant to the  Assignment and Assumption Agreements as elsewhere provided
under this Agreement;  or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) reject  the assignment of such Restricted Nonmaterial Contract, in which
case,  notwithstanding Sections 2.1 and 2.4, (A) neither this Agreement nor
the  Assignment and Assumption Agreements nor any other document related to
the  consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall constitute a sale, 
assignment, assumption, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale,
assignment,  assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such Restricted
Nonmaterial  Contract, and (B) Sellers shall retain such Restricted
Nonmaterial Contract  and all Liabilities arising therefrom or relating
thereto.

 

 

(c) Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any
Governmental  Authorization pertaining to the transfer of the Liquor Licenses
to Buyer or  any  Buyer Designee have not yet been obtained (or otherwise
are not in full force  and effect) as of the Closing, the parties shall use
commercially reasonable  efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain
the Consent relating to any  such Liquor License for which such Governmental
Authorizations were not obtained  (a " **Non-Transferred  Liquor License**
")  as  quickly as practicable following the Closing. In furtherance of the
foregoing,  each Seller holding a Non-Transferred Liquor License shall (i)
continue to  maintain such Non-Transferred Liquor License in full force
effect, subject  to  Buyer's or such Buyer Designee's responsibility for the
obligations related  thereto, and (ii) pending the obtaining of such
Governmental Authorizations  relating to any Non-Transferred Liquor License,
cooperate with Buyer or the  applicable Buyer Designee in any reasonable and
lawful arrangements designed  to  provide to Buyer or the applicable Buyer
Designee the benefits of use of the  Non-Transferred Liquor License until
such time as such Seller may transfer  such  Non-Transferred Liquor License
to Buyer or the applicable Buyer  Designee.

date) of all Leases to which Sellers are a party with respect  to  the

(a) Use  of  the Leased Real Property for the various purposes for which it
is presently  being used, is permitted as of right under all applicable
zoning legal  requirements and is not subject to "permitted nonconforming"
use or structure  classifications. All Improvements to Leased Real Property
are in compliance  with  all applicable Legal Requirements, including those
pertaining to zoning,  building and the disabled, are in good repair and in
good condition, ordinary  wear and tear excepted, and are free from latent
and patent defects. No part  of  any Improvement encroaches on any real
property not included in the Leased  Real  Property. There is no existing or
proposed plan to modify or realign any street  or highway or any existing or
proposed eminent domain proceeding that would  result in the taking of all or
any part of any Facility or that would prevent  or  hinder the continued use
of any Facility as heretofore used in the conduct  of  the business of each
Seller.

 

 

(b) Each  item  of Tangible Personal Property is in good repair and good
operating condition,  ordinary wear and tear excepted, is suitable for
immediate use in the Ordinary  Course of Business and is free from latent and
patent defects. To the Knowledge  of each Seller, no item of Tangible
Personal Property owned or leased by such  Seller is in need of repair or
replacement other than as part of routine  maintenance in the Ordinary Course
of Business. Except as disclosed in Part  3.9(b), all Tangible Personal
Property used in the Business by each Seller  is in  the possession of such
Seller.

All  Accounts Receivable that are reflected on the Balance Sheet or the
Interim  Balance Sheet or on the accounting Records of each Seller as of the
Closing  Date  represent or will represent valid obligations arising from
sales actually made  or services actually performed by such Sellers in the
Ordinary Course of  Business. Except to the extent paid prior to the Closing
Date, such Accounts  Receivable are or will be as of the Closing Date current
and collectible net  of  the respective reserves shown on the Balance Sheet
or the Interim Balance Sheet  or on the Closing Balance Sheet (which reserves
are adequate and calculated  consistent with past practice and, in the case
of the reserve on the Closing  Balance Sheet, will not represent a greater
percentage of the Accounts  Receivable reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet
than the reserve reflected  on  the Interim Balance Sheet represented of the
Accounts Receivable reflected  thereon and will not represent a material and
adverse change in the composition  of such Accounts Receivable in terms of
aging). There is no contest, claim,  defense or right of setoff, other than
returns in the Ordinary Course of  Business of Sellers, under any Contract
with any account debtor of an Account  Receivable relating to the amount or
validity of such Account Receivable.

Sellers are not in  possession of any inventory not owned by Sellers,
including goods already sold.  All of the Inventories have been valued at the
lower of cost or market value  on  a first in, first out basis. Inventories
now on hand that were purchased after  the date of the Balance Sheet or the
Interim Balance Sheet were purchased in  the  Ordinary Course of Business of
Sellers at a cost not exceeding market prices  prevailing at the time of
purchase. The quantities of each item of Inventories  held by each Seller
(whether raw materials, work-in-process or finished goods)  are sufficient
for such Seller to operate in the Ordinary Course of Business.  Work-in-
process Inventories are now valued, and will be valued on the Closing  Date,
on a tax basis.

material respects in form and operation,  and has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with, its  terms  and all applicable laws,
including ERISA and the Code, and all contributions  required to be made
under the terms of any of the Assumed Benefit Plans as  of  the date of this

the Assumed  Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, there  exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection
with which any Seller  is reasonably likely to be subject to any material
liability (other than for  routine benefit liabilities) under the terms of,
or with respect to, such  Assumed Benefit Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other
Legal Requirements.

(d) _Tax  Qualification of Plans._   Each  Target Benefit Plan that is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a), Section  401(k), Section 401(m), or
Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code has either (i)  received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified  status, or (ii) may

trust established in connection with any Target Benefit Plan which  is 
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of 
the  Code is so exempt, and to the Knowledge of Sellers, no fact or event
has  occurred that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualified
status  of  any such Target Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such
trust. 

 

 

(e) _Prohibited  Transactions, Legal Actions, Ability to Amend, and 
Deductibility._   To the  Knowledge of Sellers, there has been no prohibited
transaction (within the  meaning of Section 406 of ERISA, or Section 4975 of
the Code and other than  a  transaction that is exempt under a statutory or

the Sellers, nor to the Knowledge  of Sellers, any other Person (with the
exception of Buyer) has any legally  enforceable right or commitment to
adopt, modify or terminate any Assumed  Benefit Plan, other than with respect
to a modification or termination required  by ERISA or the Code. No suit,
administrative proceeding, action or other  litigation has been brought
within the last six years or is threatened against  or with respect to any
such Assumed Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry  by the IRS or
United States Department of Labor. Neither the Sellers nor any  ERISA
Affiliate has any liability under ERISA Section 502 with respect to any 
Assumed Benefit Plan. All contributions and payments to each Assumed Benefit 
Plan are deductible under Code Sections 162 or 404. No excise tax could 
reasonably be expected to be imposed upon any of the Sellers under Chapter 
43 of  the Code.

or Section  412 of the Code, and neither any Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate
(as defined  below) has, within the past six years, sponsored, maintained,
participated  in,  contributed to, or has been required to participate in or
contribute to, or  has  any liability in respect of, whether actual or
contingent, a Multiemployer  Plan  or other pension plan subject to Title IV
or Part 3 of Title I of ERISA or  Section 412 of the Code. None of the assets
of the Sellers or any ERISA  Affiliate is, or may reasonably be expected to
become, the subject of any lien  arising under ERISA or Section 412(n) of the
Code. For purposes of this  Agreement, " **ERISA  Affiliate,** " with 
respect to any Person, shall mean any entity (whether or not incorporated) 
other  than such Person that, together with such Person, is required to be
treated  as a  single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code.

 

 

(g) _Change  in Control_. Except  as  provided in Part 3.15(g), neither the

Assumed Benefit Plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37

cash, property, the vesting of property  or otherwise) as a result of or in
connection with the consummation of the  Contemplated Transactions (either
alone or in combination with any other event)  or by any of the ancillary
agreements, by any shareholder, employee, officer,  director or other service
provider of any Seller who is a "disqualified  individual" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)  could reasonably be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined  in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 

 

(i) _Retiree  Health/COBRA_.  Except  as required by applicable Legal
Requirements, no Target Benefit Plan provides  any of the following retiree
or post-employment benefits to any person: medical,  disability or life
insurance benefits. No Target Benefit Plan is a voluntary  employee benefit
association under Section 501(a)(9) of the Code. The Sellers  and, with
respect to clause (i), each ERISA Affiliate are in compliance in  all 
material respects with (i) the applicable requirements of the Consolidated 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the regulations 
thereunder and any similar state law and (ii) the applicable requirements of 
the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended,
and  the  regulations thereunder.

 

 

(j) _Code  Section 409A_.  Except  as set forth in Part 3.15(j), no Assumed
Benefit Plan or payment or benefit  provided pursuant to any Assumed Benefit
Plan between one or more Sellers and  any "service provider" (within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code) provides  or is reasonably likely to
provide for the deferral of compensation subject  to  Section 409A of the
Code, whether pursuant to the execution and delivery of  this  Agreement or
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (either alone  or  upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) or otherwise. Each 
Assumed Benefit Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
subject  to Section 409A of the Code has been operated and administered in
good faith  compliance with Section 409A of the Code from the period
beginning January  1,  2005 through the date hereof.

 

 

(k) _Plans  Subject to Laws of Non-United States Jurisdictions_.  Except 
as set forth in Part 3.15(k), no Seller maintains, participates in,
contributes  to or has any liability with respect to any employee benefit
plan, program,  or  other similar arrangement providing compensation or
benefits to any employee  or  former employee of any Seller (or any
dependent thereof) which plan, program  or  other similar arrangement is
subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside  of  the United States.

 

 

(l) _ERISA  Affiliates_.  Part  3.15(l) sets forth a list of each ERISA
Affiliate of each of the Sellers  (except, with respect to any Seller, for
any other Sellers which are ERISA  Affiliates of such Seller). No Assumed
Benefit Plan is, and none of the Sellers  nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof
contributes to or has any liability or  obligation, whether actual or
contingent, with respect to (i) any "multiple  employer plan" (within the
meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), or (ii) any  "multiple employer
welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of Section 3(40)  of  ERISA).

 

 

(m) _Certain  Insured Plans._ Except  as  described in Part 3.15(m), no
Assumed  Benefit  Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section  3(1) of ERISA provides health or welfare benefits that
are not fully insured  through an insurance contract, and no Seller is
obligated to directly pay any  such benefits or to reimburse any third Person
payor for the payment of such  benefits.

Proposal.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent

information or draft agreements with  respect to Parent or any of its

or discussions). Parent  agrees that it shall keep Seller Representative

proposal, offer, information request,  negotiations or discussions (including

shall promptly (and in any event within  forty-eight (48) hours) following
determination by the board  of  directors of Parent (the " **Parent 
Board** ")  that an  Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal notify
Seller Representative of  the  making of such determination. Prior to

any other Person in connection with  an  Acquisition Proposal, Parent shall
notify Seller Representative of the provision  of such non-public information
to such Person and shall provide to Seller  Representative any such non-
public information which has not been previously  provided or made available

obligations under Section 9.2(b), terminate this  Agreement if, in the case
of clause (iii), (A) the Parent Board has reasonably  determined in good
faith that the failure to take such action would be  inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Parent's stockholders under applicable  Legal
Requirements, (B) Parent has given Seller Representative five (5) business 
days' prior notice of its intention to take any such action (the " **Notice 
of Superior Proposal** "),  and  (C) at the end of such five (5) business
day period, Parent and the Parent  Board, on the one hand, and Seller
Representative, on the other, shall have  failed to agree upon such
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms  and conditions of this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions as would  be  necessary to (x)
ensure that the Parent Shares and the shares Parent Common  Stock issuable
upon the conversion of the Parent Notes would represent not  more  than
thirty-five percent (35%) of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock  on 
the Closing Date and (y) make any corresponding increase to the cash
payments  to  be made to Sellers and the Escrow Agent at Closing to offset
any decrease in  the  number of Parent Securities to be issued at Closing;
provided, however, that  Seller Representative shall not have any obligation
to accept any such  adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and
conditions of this  Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

disclosing to  the  stockholders of Parent a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2 promulgated under  the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of Parent  if,  in the good faith judgment of the Parent
Board, such disclosure would be  necessary under applicable Legal
Requirements.

Effect  of Termination

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) Each  party's right of termination under Section 9.1 is in addition to
any other  rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the
exercise of such  right of termination will not be an election of remedies,
except as otherwise  set forth in this Section 9.2. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to  Section 9.1, all obligations of the parties under
this Agreement will terminate,  except that the obligations of the parties in
this Section 9.2 and Article  12  (except for those in Section 12.5) will
survive, provided, however, that, if  this Agreement is terminated because of
a breach of this Agreement by the  nonterminating party or because one or
more of the conditions to the terminating  party's obligations under this
Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the  party's failure to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement, the  terminating party's right to
pursue all legal remedies will survive such  termination unimpaired.

 

 

(b) In  the  event this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section
9.1(e) or by  Seller Representative pursuant to Section 9.1(f), Parent shall
pay to Seller  Representative an amount equal to $3,000,000 (the "
**Termination  Fee** ").

 

 

(c) In  the  event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Seller
Representative pursuant  to  Section 9.1(b) (as a result of a breach by
Parent of Section 6.6), (ii) on  or  before the date of any such
termination, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with  respect to Parent shall
have been publicly announced or disclosed and (iii)  within twelve (12)
months of such termination, Parent shall have entered into  a  definitive
agreement with respect to, or Parent shall have consummated, an  Acquisition
Transaction (with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition 
Transaction increased to fifty percent (50%)) with the Person making such 
previously announced or disclosed Acquisition Proposal, then Parent shall
pay  to  Seller Representative, upon the consummation of such Acquisition
Transaction,  an  amount equal to the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section  9.2(d).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(d) Any  payment required to be made pursuant to Section 9.2(b) shall be made
not more  than two (2) business days after the termination giving rise to the
payments  provided for in Section 9.2(b), and any payment required to be made
pursuant  to  Section 9.2(c) shall be made as provided for in Section
9.2(c). Any payment  made  pursuant to Sections 9.2(b) or (c) shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to an account designated by
Seller Representative. The parties  hereto acknowledge and agree that any
Termination Fee paid by Parent pursuant  to  this Section 9.2 shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages in lieu of all other  Damages and as Sellers'
sole and exclusive remedy in such event. The parties  hereto further
acknowledge and agree that the extent of Damages to Sellers  occasioned by
the events giving rise to the payment of such Termination Fee  would be
impossible or extremely impractical to ascertain and that the amount  of 
the Termination Fee is a fair and reasonable estimate of such Damages to
Sellers  under the circumstances.

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) _Information  on Active Employees_.  For the  purpose of this
Agreement, the term " **Active  Employees** " shall  mean all employees
employed immediately before the Closing Date by any of the  Sellers, 
including employees on temporary leave of absence, including family medical 
leave, military leave, temporary disability or sick leave, but excluding 
employees on long-term disability leave. Part 10.1 sets forth a list of each 
Active Employee as of the date hereof. From the date hereof through Closing, 
Sellers shall give Buyer updates no less often than weekly of any
terminations  of Active Employees.

 

 

(b) _Employment  of Active Employees by Buyer; Establishment of Benefit
Plans_.

 

 

(i) Sellers  and their Affiliates shall take all necessary action to (A)
cause the employment  of all of the Active Employees to terminate effective
as of the Closing, and  (B)  cause the active participation of all Active
Employees in any Target Benefit  Plans that are not Assumed Benefit Plans to
cease effective as of the Closing.  On or before the Closing, Buyer shall
extend offers of employment effective  immediately after the Closing to each
such Active Employee with Buyer or one  of  its Affiliates on substantially
the same terms and conditions on which each  such  Active Employee was
employed with Sellers or their Affiliates immediately prior  to the Closing.
On or before the Closing Date, Seller or its Affiliates shall  notify each
Active Employee of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement  and that
reporting to work at such Active Employee's normal work location in 
accordance with such Active Employee's normal work schedule after the
Closing  shall be deemed acceptance of employment with Buyer or its
Affiliate, as  applicable, on the first date on which such Active Employee so
reports (each  Active Employee so reporting, a " **Hired  Active Employee**
").  The  offers and acceptances of employment described in this Section
10.1(b)(i) shall  occur upon the events described in this Section 10.1(b)(i)
without further  action by Buyer or its Affiliates. Subject to Legal
Requirements, Buyer will  have reasonable access before the Closing Date to
the Facilities and personnel  Records (including performance appraisals,
disciplinary actions, grievances  and  medical Records, except to the extent
prohibited by applicable Legal  Requirements) of Sellers. Access will be
provided by Sellers upon reasonable  prior notice during normal business
hours.

(ii) Effective  as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume the Assumed
Benefit Plans, together  with (A) all assets and benefit obligations in
connection therewith and (B)  all  Liabilities associated therewith which
are not Assumed Benefit Plan Retained  Liabilities. Sellers shall retain all
Assumed Benefit Plan Retained Liabilities  in all events. Buyer or its
Affiliates, as applicable, shall honor the accrued  unused vacation and other
paid leave each Hired Active Employee had with the  Seller or its Affiliates
immediately before the Closing Date.

 

 

(iii) No  Seller  or their Related Persons shall solicit the employment of
any Active Employee  or  the employment of any Hired Active Employee after
the Closing. Sellers shall  be  solely liable for complying with the WARN
Act with respect to the termination  of  employment of any Active Employee
on or before the Closing Date.

 

 

(iv) Prior  to  the Closing, (A) Buyer and Seller Representative shall
cooperate in good faith  to determine which Target Benefit Plans shall be
assigned or otherwise  transferred to Buyer (or a Buyer Designee) at Closing
(such Target Benefit  Plans, the " **Assumed  Benefit Plans** "),  and 
(B)  Sellers shall take all actions necessary or desirable, including 
without limitation, obtaining  any necessary consents and authorizations 
and  adopting any necessary plan amendments,  to (x) assign  or 
otherwise transfer sponsorship to the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer of 
each  of the Assumed Benefit Plans, by  their  terms and in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements,  effective as of the Closing Date, and (y) 
cause  all Sellers and their Affiliates to cease  being "participating
employers" and sponsors of all Assumed Benefit Plans, as  applicable. If, 
for  any reason, Sellers materially fail to comply with the requirements of
this  Section 10.1(b)(iv) with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan, then such
Assumed  Benefit Plan shall not become an Assumed Benefit Plan for any
purposes at any  time, and all assets, obligations and liabilities associated
with, arising  under  or in connection with, or otherwise relating to any
such plan shall remain  solely with Sellers and shall not be assumed by
Buyer.

 

 

(v) It  is  understood and agreed that (A) Buyer's expressed intention to
extend offers of  employment as set forth in this section shall not
constitute any commitment,  Contract or understanding (expressed or implied)
of any obligation on the part  of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to a post-
Closing employment relationship  of  any fixed term or duration or upon any
terms or conditions other than those  that  Buyer or any of its Affiliates
have agreed to establish as set forth above  or  may establish pursuant to
individual offers of employment, and (B) employment  offered by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates is "at will" and may be terminated by  Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or by any Hired Active Employee at any time  for  any reason
(subject to (x) any written commitments to the contrary made by  Buyer  or
an Affiliate of Buyer and (y) Legal Requirements, including without 
limitation the Family and Medical Leave Act). Nothing in this Agreement
shall  be  deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right of Buyer to
terminate,  reassign, promote or demote any of the Hired Active Employees
after the Closing  or to change adversely or favorably the title, powers,
duties, responsibilities,  functions, locations, salaries, other compensation
or terms or conditions of  employment of such employees. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to or shall  create any third-party rights or benefits
in any Third Parties, including  without limit any Active Employees, Hired
Active Employees, former employees  or  any beneficiaries or dependents of
the foregoing. Nothing in this Agreement  shall obligate Buyer or its
Affiliates to adopt or maintain any employee benefit  plan at any time.

         |  

11.8

    |  

Third-Party  Claims

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) Promptly  after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under Section
11.2 or 11.3  (an " **Indemnified  Person** ")  of  notice of assertion
of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified Person  will give notice
to the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an  "
**Indemnifying  Person** ")  of the  assertion of such claim. If Sellers
are the Indemnifying Person under Section  11.2 then Buyer need only give
notice to Seller Representative and Seller  Representative shall take all
actions for Sellers as an Indemnifying Person  pursuant to this Section 11.8
with respect to such Third-Party Claim. If Buyer  or the Buyer Designees are
the Indemnifying Person under Section 11.3 then  Sellers need only give
notice to Buyer and Buyer shall take all actions for  Buyer or the Buyer
Designees as an Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section  11.8 with
respect to such Third-Party Claim. Failure to notify the Indemnifying  Person
will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may  have
to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying  Person
demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is materially 
prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice.

 

 

(b) If  any  Third-Party Claim referred to in Section 11.8(a) is asserted
against an  Indemnified Person and the Indemnified Person gives notice to the
Indemnifying  Person of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person  will  be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Third-Party Claim and, to  the  extent that it wishes (unless (i) the
Indemnifying Person is also a Person  against whom the Third Party Claim is
made and the Indemnified Person reasonably  believes that there is a conflict
of interest between the Indemnifying Person  and the Indemnified Person or
(ii) the Indemnifying Person fails to provide  reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to  defend such Third-Party
Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such  Third-Party Claim),
to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel  reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person at any time within thirty  (30)  days
after the Indemnified Person has given notice of the assertion of such 
Third-Party Claim and, after notice from the Indemnifying Person to the 
Indemnified Person of its election to assume the exclusive defense of such 
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person will not, as long as it conducts 
such  defense with reasonable diligence, be liable to the Indemnified Person
under  this Article 11 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses
with respect  to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case
subsequently incurred  by  the Indemnified Person in connection with the
defense of such Third-Party Claim,  other than as expressly set forth in this
Section 11.8. If the Indemnifying  Person assumes the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, (i) such assumption will  conclusively establish for purpose of
this Agreement that the claims made in  the  Third Party Claim are within
the scope of and subject to indemnification  hereunder, (ii) no compromise or
settlement of such claims may be effected  by  the Indemnifying Person
without the Indemnified Person's consent (which may not  be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless (A) there is no finding or admission  of any
violation of Legal Requirements that would reasonably be expected to 
adversely affect Buyer in any material respect or any violation of the
rights  of  any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the  Indemnified Person and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that  are  paid in full by the Indemnifying Person, (iii) the
Indemnified Person will  have  no liability with respect to any compromise
or settlement of such claims  effected without its consent, (iv) the
Indemnified Person may participate in  the  defense, settlement or
compromise of the Third-Party Claim and employ separate  counsel at its sole
expense except as expressly provided in this Section 11.8,  and (v) the
Indemnifying Person shall consult with the Indemnified Person and  take into
account the advice and opinions of the Indemnified Person and its  counsel in
the conduct of such defense or settlement. The Indemnifying Person  shall
bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel  if: 
(x) the Indemnified Person reasonably believes that the there is a
reasonable  likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying
Person and the  Indemnified Person or (y) the Indemnifying Person shall not
have employed  counsel to represent the Indemnified Person within a
reasonable time after  the  Indemnifying Person has received notice of the
assertion of such Third-Party  Claim. If notice is given to an Indemnifying
Person of the assertion of any  Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person
does not, within thirty (30)  days  after the Indemnified Person's notice is
given, give notice to the Indemnified  Person of its election to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the  Indemnifying Person will be bound by
any determination, compromise or settlement  of the Third-Party Claim
effected by the Indemnified Person.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

77  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in
good faith after  consulting with counsel that (i) there is a reasonable
probability that a  Third-Party Claim may adversely affect the Indemnified
Person or its Affiliates  other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it would be entitled to  indemnification under this Agreement, (ii)
there is a conflict of interest  that  would prevent the Indemnifying Person
from fully or adequately representing  the  Indemnified Person's interests
with respect to a Third-Party Claim, (iii) the  Indemnifying Person assumes
such defense but fails to conduct the defense of  such Third-Party Claim with
reasonable diligence or (iv) the Indemnifying Person  declines to direct the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim pursuant to this  Section 11.8 or
withdraws from such defense, the Indemnified Person may, by  notice to the
Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend,  compromise or
settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will  be 
entitled to participate in such Third-Party Claim at its own expense. The 
Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any determination of a Third-Party 
Claim so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its
consent  (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 12.4, each Seller hereby
consents to the nonexclusive  jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding
in respect of a Third-Party  Claim is brought against any Buyer Indemnified
Person for purposes of any claim  that a Buyer Indemnified Person may have
under this Agreement with respect  to  such Proceeding or the matters
alleged therein and agree that process may be  served on Seller with respect
to such a claim anywhere in the  world.

 

 

(e) With  respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this Article  11: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person, as the  case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed of
the status of such  Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings at all
stages thereof where such  Person is not represented by its own counsel, and
(ii) the parties agree  (each at its own expense) to render to each other
such assistance as they may  reasonably require of each other and to
cooperate in good faith with each other  in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of any Third-Party  Claim.

 

 

(f) With  respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this Article  11, the parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to
preserve in full  (to  the extent possible) the confidentiality of all
Confidential Information and  the  attorney-client and work-product
privileges. In connection therewith, each  party  agrees that: (i) it will
use its commercially reasonable efforts, in  respect of any Third-Party Claim
in which it has assumed or participated in  the  defense, to avoid
production of Confidential Information (consistent with  applicable law and
rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between  any party hereto
and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense  of  any Third-
Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve  any
applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.

Other  Claims

A  claim  for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim may be  asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought. If Sellers  are the indemnifying parties under Section 11.2, Buyer
need only give notice  to  Seller Representative and Seller Representative
shall take all actions for  Sellers as an indemnifying party pursuant to this
Section 11.9 with respect  to  any claim hereunder. If Buyer is the
indemnifying party under Section 11.3,  Sellers need only give notice to
Buyer and Buyer shall take all actions as  an  indemnifying party pursuant

The  amount of any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
calculated  net of any proceeds of insurance from Seller insurance policies
existing as  of  the Closing Date received by Parent or Buyer following the
Closing Date with  respect to such Damages. Any insurance deductible paid or
payable by Buyer  and/or Parent under any such insurance policy shall be
subject to  indemnification hereunder. Buyer and/or Parent shall use
commercially reasonable  efforts, in cooperation with Seller Representative,
to pursue any possible  recovery under such insurance policies; provided,
however that neither Buyer  nor  Parent shall have no obligation hereunder
to seek insurance proceeds or make  any  insurance claim prior to the
seeking indemnification hereunder. If any amounts  are reimbursed under any
such insurance policies subsequent to indemnification  under this Article 11,
Buyer and/or Parent shall reimburse the applicable  Seller(s) in an amount
equal to the amounts subsequently received under such  insurance policy (net
of any insurance deductible paid) up to the amount of  the  indemnification
payments recovered from such Seller(s) hereunder.

responsibility of any Seller  therefor.

Any  Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
Contemplated  Transaction may be brought as follows: (a) if brought by any
Buyer Indemnified  Person against Sellers, Seller Representative, or any
Seller, shall be brought,  except as provided in Section 11.8(d), solely in

Enforcement  of Agreement

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

Each  of  the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto
would be  irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed  in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of
this Agreement  by  a party hereto could not be adequately compensated in
all cases by monetary  damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other
right or remedy to which  they may be entitled, at law or in equity, each
party hereto shall be entitled  to enforce any provision of this Agreement by
a decree of specific performance  and to temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief to prevent  breaches or threatened breaches of any of the
provisions of this Agreement,  without posting any bond or other undertaking.

Waiver;  Remedies Cumulative

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

The  rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not  alternative. Neither any failure nor any delay by any party in
exercising any  right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the
documents referred  to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege,  and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege will  preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power or privilege or  the  exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted  by applicable Legal
Requirements, (a) no claim or right arising out of this  Agreement or any of
the documents referred to in this Agreement can be  discharged by one party,
in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of  the  claim or right
unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver  that may be given
by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance  for which it
is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be  deemed to be a
waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right of the  party giving
such notice or demand to take further action without notice or  demand as
provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this  Agreement.

Entire  Agreement and Modification

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

This  Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral,
between  the  parties with respect to its subject matter (including any
letter of intent  between Buyer and Sellers and the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated April 1,  2008, among Parent, Seller Representative and HI)
and constitutes (along with  the Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Disclosure
Letter, the Exhibits and other  documents delivered pursuant to this
Agreement) a complete and exclusive  statement of the terms of the agreement
between the parties with respect to  its  subject matter. This Agreement may
not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise  modified except by a written
agreement executed by Parent, Buyer and Seller  Representative, on behalf of
Sellers.

Disclosure  Letters

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) The  information in the Disclosure Letter constitutes (i) exceptions to
the  representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of each Seller as
set  forth in this Agreement or (ii) descriptions or lists of assets and
liabilities  and other items referred to in this Agreement. The information
in the Buyer  Disclosure Letter constitutes exceptions to the
representations, warranties,  covenants and obligations of Buyer and Parent
as set forth in this Agreement.  If  there is any inconsistency between the
statements in this Agreement and those  in  the Disclosure Letter or the
Buyer Disclosure Letter, the statements in this  Agreement will control.

 

 

(b) Nothing  in the Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter is
intended to broaden  the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or  to  create any covenant unless clearly specified to the
contrary therein. Any  disclosure on one Part of the Disclosure Letter or the
Buyer Disclosure Letter  shall be deemed to be disclosed on any other Parts
of the Disclosure Letter  or  the Buyer Disclosure Letter (as the case may
be), and to qualify any other  representation or warranty in this Agreement,
to the extent that the meaning  of  such disclosure is reasonably apparent
on its face.

following the consummation  of  the transactions contemplated by the HI
Purchase Agreement, HI, the HI Acquired  Companies or any of their respective
direct or indirect Subsidiaries) and (b)  may collaterally assign its rights
hereunder to any financial institution  providing the Financing. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement  will  apply to, be binding in all
respects upon and inure to the benefit of the  successors and permitted
assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred  to in this Agreement
will be construed to give any Person other than the parties  to this
Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with 
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except such
rights  as shall inure to a successor or permitted assignee pursuant to this
Section  12.9.

and authority in  each of their names and on behalf of each of them:

 

 

(i) to  act on  behalf of each of them in the absolute discretion of Seller
Representative  with  respect to this Agreement and the Contemplated

or made by Seller Representative  pursuant to this Section 12.14. Each Seller
agrees that Seller Representative  shall have no obligation or liability to
any Person for any action or omission  taken or omitted by Seller
Representative in good faith hereunder, and each  Seller shall indemnify and
hold Seller Representative harmless from and against  any and all Liabilities
which Seller Representative may sustain as a result  of  any such action or
omission by Seller Representative hereunder. Each Seller  further agrees that
the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely  on  any action
taken by Seller Representative, on behalf of Sellers, pursuant to  the 
Section 12.14 (an " **Authorized  Action** ")  and  that any such
Authorized Action shall be binding upon all of  Sellers.

 

 

(b) Buyer  and  the Escrow Agent designated in the Escrow Agreement shall be
entitled to rely  upon any document or other paper delivered by Seller
Representative as  (i) genuine and correct and (ii) having been duly signed
or sent by  Seller Representative, and neither Buyer nor such Escrow Agent
shall be liable  to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
Buyer or such  Escrow Agent in such reliance.

 

 

(c) Seller  Representative may resign by giving not less than 60 days notice
to Buyer and  Sellers. Sellers may remove Seller Representative; provided
that Seller  Representative and Buyer have been given written notice of such
removal not  less  than ten (10) business days prior to such removal. Upon
any resignation or  removal of Seller Representative, Sellers shall designate
another Seller  Representative and shall give Buyer prompt written notice of
such designation  (which notice shall in no event be delivered to Buyer later
than five (5)  business days after such designation).
