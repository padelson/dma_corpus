 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (" **Agreement** ") is made and entered
into as of October 14, 2003, by and among CELESTICA INC., a corporation
organized under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada (" **Parent**
"); MSL ACQUISITION SUB INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" **Merger Sub** "), and Manufacturers Services
Limited, a Delaware corporation (the " **Company** ").  Certain capitalized
terms used in this Agreement are defined in **_Exhibit A_**.

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of the Company
with and into the Merger Sub in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL
(the " **Merger** "). Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company will cease
to exist, and the Merger Sub will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

  



  

It is intended that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
**Code** ").

  



  

The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
declared the advisability of and approved this Agreement and approved the
Merger.

  



  

As a condition to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent has required that (a) specified
officers and directors of the Company agree, among other things, to vote all
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such officers and
directors in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in the event that such
matter is put to the stockholders of the Company for a vote and (b) certain
stockholders of the Company agree, among other things (i) to vote all shares
of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred
beneficially owned by such stockholders in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement in the event that such matter is put to the stockholders of the
Company for a vote, and (ii) to grant an option to Parent for the purchase,
under certain circumstances, of a portion of the shares of Company Common
Stock beneficially owned by such stockholders and representing 30% of the
aggregate voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company (the "
**Stockholder Options")** , all as specified in, and in accordance with, the
terms and provisions of stockholder agreements, dated as of the date hereof,
among each stockholder (collectively, the " **Stockholders** "), Parent and
Merger Sub, the forms of which are attached hereto as **_Exhibit B-1_** and
**_Exhibit B-2_**  (the " **Stockholder Agreements** "); and in order to
induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the Stockholders
are each executing and delivering their respective Stockholder Agreements
simultaneously herewith.

1.1 _Merger_ _ of the Company with and into Merger Sub_.  Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, and the separate

"), which shall be no later than the fifth business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6, 7 and 8 (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the
applicable requirements of the DGCL (the " **Certificate of Merger** ") shall
be duly executed by the Company and, simultaneously with or as soon as

action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company or Merger Sub:

  



  



  

2      
   



  

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;

  



  

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to
Sections 1.5(b) and 1.5(c), each share of Company Common Stock then
outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive a number (which may
be less than one) of Parent Subordinate Voting Shares equal to the Share
Exchange Ratio;

  



  

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
then outstanding shall remain outstanding;

  



  

(v) each share of Series A Preferred then outstanding (other than Dissenting
Shares and other than shares for which a valid Stock Election has been made)

$52.50, plus an amount equal to the dividends accrued and unpaid on such
share of Series A Preferred to the date on which the Effective Time occurs;

  



  

(vi) each share of Series B Preferred then outstanding (other than Dissenting
Shares and other than shares for which a valid Stock Election has been made)
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
$52.50, plus an amount equal to the dividends accrued and unpaid on such
share of Series B Preferred to the date on which the Effective Time occurs;

  



  

(vii) each share of Series A Preferred then outstanding for which a valid

Parent Subordinate Voting Shares equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock into which a share of Series A Preferred is
convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of
the Preferred Governing Documents and (y) the Share Exchange Ratio; and

  



  

(viii) each share of Series B Preferred then outstanding for which a valid
Stock Election has been made (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive (a) an amount in cash equal to $2.25 or,
at the election of the Company (as directed in writing by Parent), a number
(which may be less than one) of Parent Subordinate Voting Shares equal to the
product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable in
satisfaction of the Optional Make Whole Payment (as defined in the Preferred
Governing Documents) under the Preferred Governing Documents and (2) the
Share Exchange Ratio and (b) a number (which may be less than one) of Parent

3

outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or the outstanding Parent
Subordinate Voting Shares are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Share Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(c) No fractional Parent Subordinate Voting Shares shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of capital stock of the
Company who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent
Subordinate Voting Share (after aggregating all fractional Parent Subordinate
Voting Shares issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a
share and, upon surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s), be
paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a
Parent Subordinate Voting Share on The New York Stock Exchange on the date
the Merger becomes effective.

all shares of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be

representing shares of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred and Series B
Preferred that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such
shares of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred
shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,

Company Common Stock and Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred with

against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Company Stock Certificate.

under the Securities Act) of the Company has not delivered to Parent and the
Company a duly executed Affiliate Agreement as contemplated by Section 5.10,

holder, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional Parent Subordinate Voting Share to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(c) and the proportionate amount of
any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective

Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other
applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

  

### 

  

### (f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred or Series

## 1.8 _Shares of Dissenting Pre_ _ferred Stockholders_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred held by a
person (a " **Dissenting Stockholder** ") who shall not have voted to adopt
this Agreement and who properly demands appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not
be converted as described in Section 1.5, but shall be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the DGCL, unless such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal. If, after the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or
loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Series
A Preferred or Series B Preferred shall no longer be considered Dissenting
Shares for the purposes of this Agreement and such holders shares of Series
A Preferred or Series B Preferred shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the merger
consideration set forth in Section 1.5.

Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name

it purports to own or use, and to perform all of its obligations under
Acquired Corporation Contracts to which it is a party. Each Acquired
Corporation is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in
which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or
the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so qualified would not be reasonably likely
to, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect the Acquired
Corporations in any material respect.

  

### 

  

### (b) Part 2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Acquired
Corporations and indicates as to each its jurisdiction of organization and,
except in the case of the Company, its stockholders. The Company has made

as required by the DGCL). The Board of Directors of the Company
has unanimously approved this Agreement, declared it to be advisable and
resolved to recommend to stockholders of the Company that they vote in favor

to any of the assets owned or used by any of the Acquired Corporations,

any report referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above (collectively, the "
**Certifications** "), and (vii) all comment letters received by the Company
from the Staff of the SEC since December 31, 2000 and all responses to such

## 2.5 _Financial_ _Statements_. The financial statements and notes
contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Reports fairly
present the financial condition and the results of operations, changes in
stockholders equity, and cash flow of the Company, on a consolidated basis,
as at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such
financial statements, all in accordance with US GAAP and Regulation S-X of
the SEC, subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal
recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which will not, individually or
in the aggregate, be materially adverse on a consolidated basis) and the
omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X of the SEC (that,
if presented, would not, except as set forth in Part 2.5 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, differ materially from notes to the financial
statements included in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K included in
the Filed Company SEC Reports); the financial statements referred to in
this Section 2.5 reflect the consistent application of such
accounting principles throughout the periods involved, except as disclosed in
the notes to such financial statements. No financial statements of any
Person other than the Acquired Corporations are required by US GAAP to be
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Part 2.5(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a description of all non-audit
services performed by the Companys auditors for the Acquired Corporations
since the beginning of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the Company
and the fees paid for such services; all such non-audit services performed
after the effective time of Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
were approved as required thereby. The Acquired Corporations have designed
and are using a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes

in accordance with US GAAP and the Exchange Act. The Company has delivered
to Parent copies of the documents creating or governing all of
the securitization transactions to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. The corporate records and minute books of the
Acquired Corporations have been maintained substantially in accordance with
all applicable Legal Requirements and are complete and accurate in all
material respects. Financial books and records and accounts of the Acquired
Corporations used in preparation of the Companys Financial Statements:  (x)
have been maintained in accordance with good business practices on a basis
consistent with prior years, (y) are stated in reasonable detail and reflect
the transactions of the Acquired Corporations in all material respects, and
(z) reflect the basis for the Companys consolidated financial statements in
all material respects.  The projections and forecasts of the Acquired
Corporations for their 2004 fiscal year prepared by the Senior Management as
of the date of this Agreement and previously provided to Parent (the
**"Projections"** ) were prepared in good faith for the Acquired Corporations
on a stand alone basis (without taking into account any business combination
or acquisition), were based on information deemed relevant by Senior
Management, and were based upon Senior Managements good faith estimates and
assumptions as of the date of this Agreement.

possession of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such
lease is valid and in full force and effect without default thereunder by the
lessee or the lessor, other than defaults that would not reasonably be likely
to, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect the Acquired
Corporations in any material respect.

### (b) Except as described in Part 2.6(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and except for reasonable variation in the normal course of an
electronics manufacturing services business, the Inventory does not include

# SECTION 3: _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_.

  

# 

  

Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  



  

## 3.1 _Organization_ _and Good Standing_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
are corporations duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation, with all
requisite corporate power and authority to conduct their respective
businesses as now being conducted, to own or use the

  

## 

  

## 31      
   

## 

  

## respective properties and assets that they purport to own or use, and to
perform all their respective obligations under Contracts to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets are bound. Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries are duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
and are in good standing under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction
in which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or used by them
or the nature of the activities conducted by them requires such
qualifications, except where the failure to be so qualified would not be
reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

## 

  

## 3.2 _Authority; N_ _o Conflict_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Parent and Merger Sub each have all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other agreements
referred to in this Agreement, to perform their respective obligations
hereunder and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
Contemplated Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on its part and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the Contemplated Transactions (other than, with respect to the
Merger, the filing of a certificate of merger required by the DGCL). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  

### 

  

### (b) Except as set forth in Part 3.2(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
any of the Contemplated Transactions will, directly or indirectly (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both): (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in a violation of (A) any provision of the Organizational Documents of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) any resolution adopted by the Board
of Directors or the shareholders of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; or
(ii) subject to compliance with the requirements specified in clauses (A)
through (D) of Section 3.2(c), contravene, conflict with, or result in a
violation of, or give any Governmental Body or other Person the right to
challenge any of the Contemplated Transactions or to exercise any remedy or
obtain any relief under, any Legal Requirement or any order, injunction, writ
or decree to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the assets
owned or used by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, may be subject, except,
in the case of clause (ii), for any such conflicts or violations that would
not be reasonably likely to prevent or delay consummation of the Merger in
any material respect, or otherwise would not prevent Parent from performing
any of its material obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

  

### 

  

### (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent do not, and
the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions by Parent will not, require any Consent of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Body, except (i) for (A) applicable
requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, The New York
Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange, (B) the pre-merger notification
requirements of the HSR Act, (C) filing of appropriate merger documents as

  

### 

  

### 32      
   

### 

  

### required by the DGCL and (D) the non-United States competition, antitrust
and investment laws set forth in Part 3.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) where failure to obtain such Consents, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not prevent or delay consummation of the
Merger in any material respect, or otherwise prevent Parent from performing
any of its material obligations under this Agreement in any material respect,
and would not reasonably be likely to, individually or in the aggregate,
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

###

extend or enter into any such Option. Except for repurchase
obligations pursuant to the indenture governing the LYONs, there are no
outstanding rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of
any kind obligating Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or
dispose of any shares of capital stock or other equity or voting securities
of Parent or any securities of the type described in the two immediately

## 3.4 _SEC_ _Reports_.  Parent has on a timely basis filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since December
31, 2000. Part 3.4 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists and Parent has
delivered to the Company copies in the form filed with the SEC of all of the
following, except to the extent available in full without redaction (other
than redaction as to which confidential treatment has been requested or
granted) on the SECs web site through EDGAR two days prior to the date of
this Agreement: (i) Parents Annual Reports on Form 20-F for each fiscal year
of Parent beginning since December 31, 2000, (ii) all proxy statements
relating to Parents meetings of stockholders (whether annual or special)
held, and all information statements relating to stockholder consents, since
the beginning of the first fiscal year referred to in clause (i) above, (iii)
its Current Reports on Form 6-K filed since the beginning of the first fiscal
year referred to in clause (i) above, (iv) all other forms, reports,
registration statements and other documents (other than preliminary materials
if the corresponding definitive materials have been provided to the Company
pursuant to, or are available through EDGAR as contemplated by, this Section
3.4) filed by Parent with the SEC since the beginning of the first fiscal
year referred to in clause (i) above (the forms, reports, registration
statements and other documents referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv) above, whether or not available through EDGAR, are, collectively, the "
**Parent SEC Reports** "), and (v) all certifications and statements required
by (x) the SECs Order dated June 27, 2002 pursuant to Section 21(a)(1) of
the Exchange Act (File No. 4-460), (y) Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act, or (z) 18 U.S.C. §1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002) with respect to any report referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above
(collectively, the " **Certifications** "), and (vi) all comment letters
received by Parent from the Staff of the SEC since December 31, 2000 and all
responses to such comment letters by or on behalf of Parent. The Parent
SEC Reports (x) were or will be prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations thereunder and (y) did not at the time they
were filed with the SEC, or will not at the time they are filed with the SEC,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Certifications (other than those containing
materiality qualifications) are each true and correct in all material
respects and the Certificates containing materiality qualifications are each
true and correct in all respects. No Subsidiary of Parent is or has been
required to file any form, report, registration statement or other document
with the SEC. The Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain disclosure controls
and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all material information
concerning Parent and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of Parents filings with the SEC
and other public disclosure documents. Parent is in compliance with the
applicable listing rules of The New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock
Exchange and has not since December 31, 2000 received any notice from The New
York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange asserting any non-
compliance with such rules. As used in this Section 3.4, the term " **file**
" has the meaning given to it in Section 2.4.

  

## 

  

## 3.5 _Financ_ _ial Statements_. The financial statements and notes contained
or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Reports fairly present the
financial condition and the results of operations, changes in stockholders
equity, and cash flow of Parent and its Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial statements, all in
accordance with generally accepted Canadian accounting principles (and, in
the

## 34      
   

## 

  

## case of the Parents annual financial statements included in its Annual
Reports on Form 20-F, with a reconciliation to US GAAP), subject, in the case
of interim financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments
(the effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be
materially adverse) and the omission of notes (that, if presented, would not
differ materially from notes to the financial statements included in Parents
Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2002); the
financial statements referred to in this Section 3.5 reflect the consistent
application of such accounting principles throughout the periods involved,
except as disclosed in the notes to such financial statements. No financial
statements of any Person other than Parent and its Subsidiaries are required
by generally accepted Canadian accounting principles to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company. Parent has designed and is
using a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles and the
Exchange Act.

  

## 

  

## 3.6 _Tax M_ _atters_.  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has taken any action,

accounting principles or disclosed in the notes thereto, except for
liabilities or obligations adequately and fully reflected or reserved against
in the balance sheet, or disclosed in the notes thereto, included in Parents
balance sheet dated June 30, 2003 as filed with Parents Form 6-K filed with
the SEC, liabilities incurred since June 30, 2003 in the ordinary course of
business, and contingent or inchoate liabilities that would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

## 

  

## 3.8 _Leg_ _al Proceedings_.  Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Reports, at the date of this Agreement, there is no pending Legal Proceeding
(a) that has been commenced by or against Parent or its Subsidiaries or that
otherwise relates to or may affect the business of, or any of the assets
owned or used by, Parent or its Subsidiaries, except for such Legal
Proceedings as are normally incident to the business carried on by Parent and
its Subsidiaries and would not reasonably be likely to, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (b) that would
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
or (c) against any director or officer of Parent pursuant to Section 8A or
20(b) of the Securities Act or Section 21(d) or 21C of the Exchange Act.

Adverse Effect on Parent or which would prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

## 

  

## there has not been any Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and (b) no event
has occurred or circumstance exists that would be reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

  

## 

  

## 3.10 _Bro_ _kers_. No broker, finder, investment banker or other Person is
entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection
with the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent.

  

## 

  

## 3.11 _F-4/Proxy_ _Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Form F-4 Registration Statement will, at the time the Form
F-4 Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a

to, any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of
the Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder

such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing (A) customary
limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral

favorable to the Company than the provisions contained in that certain mutual
nondisclosure agreement dated May 27, 2003 between the Company and Parent
(the " **Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement** ") and (B) "standstill" provisions
that prohibit such Person from purchasing any Company securities or
commencing any exchange or tender offer for Company securities other than

furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges
and agrees that any violation of or the taking of any action inconsistent

Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations shall be deemed
to constitute a breach of this Section 4.3 by the Company.

from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality or "standstill" agreement that prohibits any Person from
purchasing any Company securities or commencing any exchange or tender offer
for Company securities without the prior approval of the Board of Directors
of the Company, to which any of the Acquired Corporations is a party, and
will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such
agreement. The Company also will promptly request each Person that
has executed, within 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement,
a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a
possible Acquisition Transaction or equity investment with the Company or any
other Acquired Corporation to return all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired
Corporations.

the Company in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) of the stock option plan under which it was issued and the terms
of the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced or the warrant
agreement under which it was issued, as applicable. From and after
the Effective Time: (i) each Option of the Company assumed by Parent may be
exercised solely for Parent Subordinate Voting Shares; (ii) the number of
Parent Subordinate Voting Shares subject to each Option of the Company that
represents the right to acquire one share of Company Common Stock shall be
equal to the Share Exchange Ratio of a Parent Subordinate Voting Share and
the exercise price under each such Option of the Company shall remain the
same; (iii) the number of Parent Subordinate Voting Shares subject to each
Option of the Company that represents the right to acquire more than one
share of Company Common Stock shall be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Option of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Share Exchange Ratio, rounding up or
down to the nearest whole share, and the per share exercise price under each
such Option of the Company shall be adjusted by dividing the per share
exercise price under such Option of the Company by the Share Exchange Ratio
and rounding down or up to the nearest cent; and (iv) any restriction on the
exercise of any such Option of the Company shall continue in full force and
effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of
such Option of the Company remaining in effect after the Effective Time shall
otherwise remain unchanged; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Option of the
Company assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 5.4(a) shall, in
accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent to
the Effective Time.  Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than five
business days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective, a
registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the Parent Subordinate Voting
Shares issuable with respect to the Company Stock Options and a registration
statement on Form F-3 relating to the resale of the Parent Subordinate Voting
Shares issuable with respect to warrants assumed by Parent in accordance with
this Section 5.4(a) and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Company Stock Options or warrants remain outstanding. In addition,
Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to file all documents
required to be filed to cause the Parent Subordinate Voting Shares issuable
with respect to the Options of the Company assumed by Parent in accordance
with this Section 5.4(a) to be listed on The New York Stock Exchange and the
Toronto Stock Exchange on or before the Effective Time, subject to notice of
issuance.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.4, in lieu of assuming outstanding Options of the Company in accordance
with Section 5.4(a), Parent may, at its election or shall, if required by the
terms of any Option of the Company (including the warrants issued on March
14, 2002 and the warrants issued on July 3, 2003), cause such outstanding
Options of the Company to be replaced by issuing replacement instruments of
Parent as nearly equivalent as practicable in substitution therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) Within ten days after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
each holder of an Option of the Company an appropriate notice setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to the Option of the Company, as provided in
this Section 5.4.

### 

  

### (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take all
action that may be necessary (under the Plans pursuant to which Options of
the Company are outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 5.4 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
holders of Options of the Company have no rights with respect thereto other
than those specifically provided in this Section 5.4.

  

### 

  

### (e) As of the Effective Time, the ESPP shall be terminated. The rights of
participants in the ESPP with respect to any offering period then underway
under the ESPP shall be determined by treating the last business day prior to
the Effective Time as the last day of such offering period and by making such
other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under such
Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
5.4(e).

  

### 

  

### (f) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture
or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement
or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has any
rights, then the Parent Subordinate Voting Shares issued in exchange for such
shares of Company Common Stock will also be and subject to the same
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
certificates representing Parent Subordinate Voting Shares may accordingly be
marked with appropriate legends. The Company shall take all action that
may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth
in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

  

### 

  

### (g) Prior to and at the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions (which shall be in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements)
as may be necessary under the Companys (i) Second Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, (ii) Certificate of Designations of 5.25% Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock and (iii) Certificate of Designations of 4.5% Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock, and/or any other applicable governing documents
or resolutions (collectively, the **"Preferred Governing Documents"** ),
including the giving of notices as specified therein, such that at the
Effective Time, each outstanding share of Series A Preferred and Series B
Preferred shall, subject to Section 1.5 and Section 1.8, without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and cease to be outstanding,
and the rights of the holders thereof as stockholders of the Company shall
cease (except for the right to receive the applicable cash consideration or,
if a valid Stock Election was made with respect thereto, the applicable
number of Parent Subordinate Voting Shares and any cash consideration payable
in respect of the Optional Make Whole Payment, if any). If, after the
Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of
Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred (other than Dissenting Shares) is
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such certificate shall be
canceled and exchanged for cash or, if a valid Stock Election was made with
respect thereto, for Parent Subordinate Voting Shares and any cash
consideration payable in respect of the Optional Make Whole Payment, if any,
in accordance with the terms hereof.

## 5.5 _Employee Benefits_. Parent agrees that all employees of the Acquired
Corporations who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("
**Continuing Employees** ") shall be eligible to continue to participate in
the Surviving Corporations health, vacation and other non-equity based
employee benefit plans; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (a) nothing in this
Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health, vacation or
other employee benefit plans at any time, and (b) if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation terminates any such health, vacation or other employee benefit
plan, then, subject to any necessary transition period, the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents health, vacation and
other non-equity based employee benefit plans (or those of a Subsidiary of
Parent), to substantially the same extent as employees of Parent (or a
Subsidiary, if applicable) in similar positions and at similar grade levels.
For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the Parent or any
Subsidiary (other than such plans providing for retiree medical benefits)
providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Closing (the " **New
Plans** "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her
periods of service with the Company before the Closing for purposes of
participation, vesting and benefits levels where length of service is
relevant to benefit levels, but not for benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plan or any accrual that would result in any duplication of benefits.
 In addition, and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence:
(i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plans replaces coverage under a comparable Plan (such Plans,
collectively, the " **Old Plans** ") and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, the Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan that did not
apply to the Old Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents and shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under any Old Plan to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for purposes of any New Plan which provides a type of coverage not
afforded to Continuing Employees under any of the Old Plans, or any Plan of
Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent which provides either post-retirement or

eligible to participate, or shall participate at Parents sole discretion

construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to any
other binding agreement between an employee and Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent, the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

## 

  

### (a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director or officer of

  

### 

  

### 49      
   

### 

  

### the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the **"Covered Parties"** ),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements (collectively, **"Costs"** ), incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
the fact that the Covered Party is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (including the taking of any action or the
failure to take any action as a director or officer of any Acquired
Corporation in connection with the Contemplated Transactions), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under the DGCL for officers and directors of Delaware
corporations. Each Covered Party will be entitled, subject to applicable
Legal Requirements, to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation within ten business days of receipt by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from the Covered Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ _that _ any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it
is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

  

### 

  

### (b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Company.

  

### 

  

### (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six years from the Effective Time
the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of
200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 200%,
the **"Maximum Premium"** ). If the Companys existing insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the
Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for
an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Covered Parties than the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is made against any Covered Party, on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of Section 5.6(a)
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

### 

  

### (e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person

the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

  

### 

  

## 5.7 _Disclosure_.  Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
with respect to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Parent nor the
Company shall, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, make any
disclosure regarding the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
unless (a) the other shall have approved such disclosure or (b) such party
shall have determined in good faith that such disclosure is required by
applicable Legal Requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party to
the transaction (and each employee or other Representative of each such
party) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitations of any kind,
the tax treatment and tax structure of the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to the party relating to such tax treatment and
tax structure; provided, however, that the foregoing permission to disclose
the tax treatment and tax structure does not permit the disclosure of any
information that is not relevant to understanding the tax treatment or tax
structure of the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; provided,
further, however, that the tax treatment and tax structure shall be kept
confidential to the extent necessary to comply with federal or state
securities laws. In addition, no party is subject to any restriction
concerning its consulting with its tax advisers regarding the tax treatment
or tax structure of the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions at any
time.

Date.

  

## 

  

## 5.9 _Section 16_ _b-3_. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company shall take all
such steps as may be required and within its control to cause the
Contemplated Transactions and any other dispositions of equity securities of

Affiliate Agreement in the form of **Exhibit D** (each, an **Affiliate
Agreement** ").

  

##

representation letters delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence dated as of the Closing Date, and modified to reflect changes in
Legal Requirements, if any, and such other matters as Kaye Scholer LLP and
Hale and Dorr LLP may reasonably request. Following delivery of the tax
representation letters contemplated pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 5.12(a), each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause Kaye Scholer LLP to deliver to Parent, and Hale and Dorr LLP
to deliver to the Company, a tax opinion with respect to matters as are
appropriate for description, and inclusion as exhibits, in the Form F-4
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement, such opinions to be
substantially similar in substance. In rendering such opinions, each of such
counsel shall be entitled to rely on the tax representation letters referred
to in this Section 5.12(a).

  

### 

  

### (b) None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company will take any action that
would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or fail to
take any action the omission of which would reasonably by expected to cause
the Merger to fail to so qualify.

  

### 

  

### (c) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
certificates, either (i) duly completed and executed pursuant to Section

demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent (with respect to the

inaccuracies in the representation and warranties contained in this Agreement
or any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) waive
