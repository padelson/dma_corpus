with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, " **Dissenting Company Shares** ")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger

Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer
be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section
2.08_.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for

Consideration _less_ the per share exercise price of such Company Option (the

the Effective Time, subject to _Section 2.08(e)_, an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the number of Company Shares subject to such cancelled
Company PSU Award multiplied by the Merger Consideration (the " **Company PSU
Consideration** "). The total number of Company Shares subject to a Company
PSU Award shall be determined (A) for Company PSU Awards with a performance
period ending prior to the Closing Date by its terms, based on actual
performance through the end of such performance period and (B) for Company PSU
Awards with a performance period not ending prior to the Closing Date by its
terms, at 100% of target levels.

necessary to (i) ensure that no new "Payment Period" (as such term is defined
in the Company ESPP) commences after the date hereof, (ii) ensure that no new
participants be permitted to participate in the Company ESPP and that the
existing participants thereunder may not increase their elections with respect
to the Payment Period in effect on the date hereof (the " **Final Payment
Period** ") and (iii) provide notice to participants describing the treatment
of the Company ESPP pursuant to this _Section 2.07(h)_. If the Effective Time

invested in Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
notionally reinvested in one or more other "Earnings Measures" (as defined in
the

(j) The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by _Section 2.07(d)_, _Section 2.07(e)_ and _Section 2.07(f)_
under all Company Option Company Restricted Stock Unit and Company PSU Award
agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including
delivering all required notices, obtaining any consents, making any amendments
and passing resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Surviving Corporation cash in

and (iv) to each of the holders of Company Deferred Cash Awards, the

Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

Section 2.08. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " **Payment Agent** ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent, on behalf of
Acquisition Sub, shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment
Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, for payment
to the holders of Company Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders
of Company Shares become entitled under this _Article II_. For purposes of
determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent shall assume that
no Company Stockholder shall perfect any right to appraisal of such Company
Stockholders Company Shares. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Payment
Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of
the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America (such cash amount being referred to herein as the
" **Exchange Fund** "). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund is
otherwise insufficient for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by this _Article II_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to

 



      
 

 



 

ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient
for the Payment Agent to make such payments contemplated by this _Article
II_.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time), Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a
certificate or certificates (the " **Certificates** ") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares and whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.07_ (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment
Agent) and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and uncertificated Company Shares (the " **Uncertificated
Shares** "), in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such
Certificates that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.07_, by (y) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and such
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No holder of
Uncertificated Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_ARTICLE II_. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more
Uncertificated Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares represented
by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.07_ by
(y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in
respect thereof), and the Uncertificated Shares shall forthwith be cancelled.
The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this _Section 2.08_. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is

 



      
 

 



 

properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and
the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated
by Parent) any transfer taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

 



 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Shares, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, Company PSU
Awards and Company Deferred Cash Awards such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or received
Merger Consideration with respect to Uncertificated Shares for exchange
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.08_ shall thereafter look for
payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent, as
general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article II_. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which the Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 2.09. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after
the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder
of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 2.08_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares. From and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent or the Payment Agent in their respective reasonable and customary
discretion, the posting, by such holder of a bond in such reasonable amount as
the Payment Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent with respect to such Certificate, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.07_.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except (a) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on

authority would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its

bylaws.

 



 

Section 3.02. _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, and,

consummation of the Merger, obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval and
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and Acquisition Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except

Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) subject in the case of the Company
to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, (b) subject to obtaining the Consents set forth in _Section

Section 4.10. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies, as
of the date of this Agreement, of an executed commitment letter and fee letter
(the " **Fee Letter** ") (provided that fee, "market flex" and other economic
terms which do not affect the amount, availability or conditionality of any
portion of the Debt Financing have been redacted (the " **Redacted Fee
Letter** ")) from the financial institutions identified therein (the " **Debt
Commitment Letter** ") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively
referred to as the " **Debt Financing** ").

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Parent will have sufficient funds to (i) pay the Merger
Consideration payable hereunder, (ii) refinance any existing indebtedness for
borrowed money that may become due and payable as a result of the Merger,
(iii) pay any and all fees and expenses in connection with the Merger or the
financing thereof (including each of the transactions described in _Section

other payment obligations hereunder.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect, is a valid and binding obligation of Acquisition Sub and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, and is enforceable in
accordance with its respective terms against Acquisition Sub and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each case, subject
to the Enforceability Limitations. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been
amended or modified, and the obligations and commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Parent
or Acquisition Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the
date hereof. Assuming accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Article III_, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any other parties thereto, or result in a failure of any condition,
under the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise result in any of the Debt
Financing to be unavailable at the Closing. There are no side letters or other
Contracts or arrangements (except for any agreements entered into after the
date of this Agreement that are expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter) relating to the Debt Financing.

conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ and (ii)
satisfaction by the Company of its obligations under _Section 6.10_, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be
available to Parent or Acquisition Sub on the date of the Closing. The Debt
Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of the parties thereunder to make the Debt Financing available to Parent on
the terms therein.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has, directly or indirectly, entered
into any exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement, arrangement or
binding understanding with any bank or investment bank or other potential
provider of debt or equity financing that prohibits such provider from
providing or seeking to provide services, including debt or equity financing,
to any third Person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making of any
Acquisition Proposal) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.11. _Solvency_. Assuming that the most recent financial statements
included in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed by the Company with the SEC present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated
results of operations of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the
periods covered thereby, then at and immediately following the Effective Time
and after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the funding of the Debt Financing, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation will be, on a
consolidated basis, Solvent. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is entering
into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.

 



 

Section 4.12. _Acknowledgement of No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges that it has conducted its
own independent investigation and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise)
and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and that it and its
representatives have received access to such books and records, facilities,
equipment, Contracts and other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
it and its representatives have desired for such purpose and that it and its
representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and to discuss the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and
prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, except with respect to the representations and warranties
contained in _ARTICLE III_ or any breach of any covenant or other agreement
of the Company contained in this Agreement, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall
have any liability to Parent or Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates
or Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal
or state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information or
statements (or any omissions therefrom) provided or made available by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or Representatives to
Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any Contract or
any commitments to enter into any Contract pursuant to which: (i) any
stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote against, or not to tender
Company Shares in any offer in connection with, any Superior Proposal; or (ii)
any third party has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, any capital
(other than pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter) to Parent or the Company
to finance in whole or in part any of the uses of the Debt Financing described
in clauses (i) through (iv) of _Section 4.10(b)_.

restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, inapplicable to any
Person other than Parent and its Affiliates or to any transactions
constituting or contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal; or (vi) adopt
resolutions to do any of the foregoing or agree to do any of the foregoing.
The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof
instruct each Person that has within the two years prior to the date hereof
executed a confidentiality agreement (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company promptly to return to the
Company or destroy all confidential information, documents, and materials
relating to the Acquisition Proposal or to the Company or its businesses,
operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its
Representatives to such Person or any of its Representatives in accordance
with the terms of such confidentiality agreement with such Person.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.02(a)_, if after
the date of this Agreement but prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.02(a)_ which the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside counsel and financial advisors, constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take the actions described in clauses
"(i)" and "(ii)" below would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the Company Boards fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, then the Company may
take the following actions: (i) furnish information to the third party making
such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that substantially concurrently the
Company makes available such information to Parent to the extent such
information is material and was not previously made available to Parent) and
(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect
to the Acquisition Proposal, in each case of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)", if, and
only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from
the third party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement
(an " **Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement** "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall provide written notice to Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable after any such determination by the Company Board and before first
taking any of the actions described in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above. From
and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall notify Parent
promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) of the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, and (A) if it is in writing, deliver to Parent a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal and any related draft agreement and other written
material received from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal setting
forth the terms and conditions of such Acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal or (B) if oral, provide to Parent a summary of the material terms and
conditions thereof including the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
prompt and timely basis of the status and material details of any such
Acquisition Proposal and with respect to any material change to the terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal within 24 hours of such material change.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, amend,
modify or waive any rights under, or release any Person (other than Parent and
Acquisition Sub) from, any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Person, on the
other; _provided_ , that if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law not to do so, the
Company may waive any standstill or similar provisions in such agreements to
the extent necessary to permit a Person to make, on a confidential basis to
the Company Board, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such Person
agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent and Acquisition
Sub, in each case as contemplated by and subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.02_.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 5.02(e)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall: (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, the Company Board Recommendation; or (ii) approve, endorse or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal; (each of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)", a "
**Company Board Recommendation Change** "); _provided, further_ , that a
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed
to be a Company Board Recommendation Change or a Triggering Event. At any time
following the making by any Person of a public Acquisition Proposal, Parent
may submit one time a written request to the Company Board that the Company
Board publicly reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of such a request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each public Acquisition Proposal and any publicly disclosed change to the
material terms thereof shall renew Parents right to request reaffirmation of
the Company Board Recommendation.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may: (i) make a Company Board Recommendation
Change only in response to (A) the Company receiving an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal and not
involving a material breach of _Section 5.02(a)_ of this Agreement or (B) an
Intervening Event; or (ii) if the Company has complied in all material
respects with _Section 5.02_, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
and, substantially concurrently with, and as a condition to such termination,
cause the Company to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for
such Superior Proposal, which proposal did not result from any breach of this
_Section 5.02_, if and only if, in all cases, (x) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with and receiving advice from
outside counsel, that (1) the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change or (2) terminate this Agreement and enter into a definitive written
agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, in each case, would reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law
and (y) the Company complies with the provisions of _Section 5.02(g)_ and
_Section 5.02(h)_.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from: (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Delaware Law; _provided_ , that this _Section 5.02(f)_ shall not
in and of itself be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change that would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to
_Section 5.02(e)_.

 



 

(g) Subject to _Section 5.02(h)_, (i) no Company Board Recommendation Change
may be made in response to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event and (ii)
no termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 5.02(e)_ may be
made: (A) until the fourth (4th) Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends
to, in the case of clause "(i)", make such Company Board Recommendation
Change, or, in the case of clause "(ii)", terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 5.02(e)_ (each, a " **Company Board Recommendation
Notice** ") which notice shall specify (1) in the case of such an action taken
in connection with a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and a copy of the then-current forms of all of the relevant proposed
transaction documents related thereto, including definitive agreements with
respect to such Superior Proposal) or (2) if the basis of the proposed action
by the Company Board is an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed
description of the Intervening Event; and (B) unless the Company shall have,
(x) during the four (4) Business Day period specified above (and any
additional period related to a revision to the Superior Proposal, as provided
below), negotiated, and directed the Companys financial advisors and legal
counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
indicates to the Company that Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to
proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed to
be made in writing by Parent so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in the case of a Company Board
Recommendation Notice that is related to an Intervening Event, so that the
failure to make such Company Board Recommendation Change would no longer be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under Delaware Law) and
no such agreement is reached and (y) substantially concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.02(e)_, pay the
Termination Fee as forth in _Section 8.03(b)(i)_ ( _provided_ that Parent
shall have provided wiring instructions for such payment or, if not, then such
payment shall be paid promptly following delivery of such instructions).

 



 

(h) The parties agree that, in the case of such actions taken in connection
with a Superior Proposal, any material amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company
Board Recommendation Notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period
(the period inclusive of all such days, the " **Notice Period** "). The
Company agrees that: (i) during the Notice Period the Company shall, and shall
direct the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (if Parent indicates to the Company that
Parent desires to negotiate) the terms of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and (ii) the Company shall take into account all changes to the
terms of this Agreement agreed to be made in writing by Parent in determining
whether such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.
The Company shall promptly keep Parent informed of all material developments
affecting the material terms of any such Superior Proposal (and the Company
shall provide Parent with copies of any additional material written materials
received that relate to such Superior Proposal).

adversely affecting the consummation of the Merger or the ability of such
party to fully perform its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be required prior to

agreed by the parties). Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other
with any information that may be required in order to make such filings and

its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as

notice of all in-person meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to
the Merger, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such

the event the parties to this Agreement disagree, in good faith, despite good
faith cooperation and consultation of the parties as required herein, on any
strategy related to Antitrust Law (including whether to take any action
required hereby), Parent shall, subject to and without limiting Parents
obligations under this _Section 6.02_, be permitted to implement a strategy
which it has previously discussed and consulted with and as to which it has
taken the Companys views into account in good faith and

 



      
 

 



 

which it has developed, implemented and pursued with a view to obtaining any
necessary clearances under Antitrust Law as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event by the Termination Date). Any such disclosures, rights to
participate or provisions of information by one party to the other may be made
on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Law or as
appropriate to protect confidential business information and may be redacted
(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or
applicable Laws and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client
or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to: (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by this _Section 6.02_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not

from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) promptly make any filings,

registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals under applicable
Antitrust Law (collectively, " **Antitrust Clearances** "), including
accepting operational restrictions or limitations on, and committing to or
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, the
sale, license, disposition or holding separate of, such assets or businesses
of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with, and
submission to decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders of such Governmental
Authority) as may be required to obtain such Antitrust Clearances or to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees,
judgments, injunctions or orders under any Antitrust Laws that would otherwise
have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event no later than thirteen (13) Business Days (subject to a five (5)
Business Day cure period) after the date of this Agreement or such later date
to which Parent consents (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed)), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to _Section 5.02(e)_, include the
Company Board Recommendation, and the Company and Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments by
the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement and use reasonable efforts to
cause the definitive Proxy Statement and notice of the Company Stockholder
Meeting to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cooperate
with the Company in the preparation of

 



      
 

 



 

the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish all information reasonably requested by
the Company that is customarily included in a proxy statement prepared in
connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, or as
otherwise required by Law or requested by the SEC. The Company shall promptly
notify Parents counsel upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parents counsel with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to Proxy Statement. The
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and propose
comments on the Proxy Statement (and any amendments or supplements thereto) or
any responses to the SEC and shall in good faith consider such comments
reasonably proposed by Parent for inclusion therein. The Company shall cause
the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as of the
record date established for the Company Meeting as promptly as practicable,
and in no event more than five (5) Business Days after the date on which the
SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or as
otherwise agreed to by Parent.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of the Company
Stockholder Meeting. In addition, the Company shall as soon as practicable
after the definitive Proxy Statement is first disseminated to the Company
Stockholders, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose
of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that the Company
Stockholder Meeting shall be held no later than forty (40) days after the
definitive Proxy Statement is first disseminated to the Company Stockholders
(unless adjourned in accordance with the terms of this _Section 6.03(b)_).
Subject to _Section 5.02(e)_, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part to obtain from the
Company Stockholders the Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company
Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Unless this
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Companys
obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting in accordance with the foregoing sentence of this _Section 6.03(b)_
shall apply notwithstanding the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission of any Acquisition Proposal to the Company, the Company Board, its
Representatives or the Company Stockholders, or by any Company Board
Recommendation Change, and the Company shall not submit to the vote of the
Company Stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting except that the Company may, without
the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting, after consultation with Parent, (A) if the failure to
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting would reasonably be
expected to be a violation of applicable Law or for the distribution of any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement, (B) if as of the time
for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Shares
represented (either in Person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting or (C) to allow time
for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure
document that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) is necessary or
required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Laws or for the Company
to comply with its obligations under _Section 5.02(g)_ or _Section 5.02(h)_;
_provided_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

 _however_ , that in the event that there are insufficient votes to obtain the
Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company
may, and upon Parents request, the Company shall postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting up to two (2) times for up to thirty (30) days to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release
with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release
to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. None of the Company,
on the one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue
any public release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to
which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow, to the extent practicable and permissible
pursuant to applicable Law, the other party or parties hereto reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it
being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the disclosing party); _provided, however_ ,
that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.04_ shall not apply to (a)
any release or announcement made or proposed to be made following a Company
Board Recommendation Change or with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (b)
any release or announcement that is consistent in all material respects with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by a
party hereto in accordance with this Agreement, in each case under this clause
(b) to the extent such disclosure is still accurate.

 



 

Section 6.05. _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover
or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Access; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the
Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, and subject to the other restrictions in
this _Section 6.06_, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and
records and personnel of the Company; _provided, however_ , that the Company
may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to
the extent that (i) any Contract or applicable Law requires the Company to
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii)
access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of

 



      
 

 



 

waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information, (iii) such
access would violate any obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to confidentiality obligations to any third party; or (iv) result
in a competitor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receiving
information that is competitively sensitive; and _provided further_ , that no
information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.06_ shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent
and Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does not provide
access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in
a way that would not violate the foregoing restrictions, including by
providing such information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such a
privilege or comply with such Law or otherwise make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements, to the extent possible. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.06_ shall be conducted
in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this _Section 6.06_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, none of Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants or other agents and representatives shall, without
the prior written consent of the Company, conduct any environmental
investigation at any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property involving any
sampling or other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater,
or soil at or in connection with any Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property.

 



 

(b) The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
any information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 6.06_. Except for disclosures expressly
permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall hold,
and shall cause its Representatives to hold, all information received from the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.07. _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall be permitted to
take all actions reasonably necessary or advisable to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities
of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.08. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
existing in favor of those Persons who are present or former directors and
officers of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " **Indemnified Parties** ") for
their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided
in the indemnification agreements between the Company and said Indemnified
Parties (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the forms made
available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause them to be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware Law. In
furtherance of the foregoing, for not less than six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or
other similar documents) of each of the Companys Subsidiaries shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are
currently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company or the equivalent organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against (i) all losses,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next
sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on
or arise out of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or
fiduciary under benefit plans, including payment on behalf of or advancement
to the Indemnified Party of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, (the " **Indemnified Liabilities** "), and (ii) all
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or
pertain to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and including any
expenses incurred in enforcing such Persons rights under this _Section
6.08_; provided, that (x) none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (y)
except for legal counsel engaged for one or more Indemnified Parties on the
date hereof, none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
under this _Section 6.08(a)_ to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
legal counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties)
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single
legal action except to the extent that, on the advice of any such Indemnified
Partys counsel, two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have
conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. In the event of any such
loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly, and in any
event within thirty (30) days, after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred (provided that, if legally required,
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective Time, and if the
Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, obtain
and fully pay the premium for an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for a period from the Effective Time through and including
the date six (6) years after the Closing Date (a " **Tail Policy** ") with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, and which Tail Policy shall contain coverage and amounts
equivalent to and in any event at least as favorable to the Indemnified
Parties as the coverage currently provided by Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance policies (in the aggregate); provided, however,
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend, for the entire Tail Policy, in excess of three (3) times the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, provided,
further that, if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy or
policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to
obtain such "tail" insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought
before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the
directors and officers liability insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are equivalent
to and in any event at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable
directors and officers liability insurance for such six-year period (and for
so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year
period thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are equivalent to and in any event at least as
favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay annual premiums in the aggregate more than an amount equal to
300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such directors and
officers liability insurance.

 



 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.08_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.08_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs. This _Section 6.08_ may not be amended, altered or repealed after the
Effective Time without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified
Party.

 



 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.08_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.09. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the one (1) year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide each employee
of the Company and any Subsidiary who continues to be employed by the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof following the Effective Time
(the " **Continuing Employees** ") with (i) base wages or salary, (ii) annual
cash bonus opportunities (as a percentage of base salary), (iii) level of
severance benefits and (iv) all other employee benefits (except for retention
benefits) that with respect to "(i)", "(ii)", "(iii)" and "(iv)" are at least
substantially comparable in the aggregate to that provided to Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, and taking into account the
target value of annual equity incentive awards granted to Continuing Employees
prior to the Closing Date in determining such substantially comparable
compensation and benefits (whether or not provided as equity awards). For
purposes of clause (ii) of this _Section 6.09(a)_, the severance benefits
that are available to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date shall be determined under the terms of the applicable severance plan,
policy, agreement or guidelines maintained by the Company at such time and as
otherwise listed as Company Benefit Plans on _Section 3.17(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and determination of
the level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the
Effective Time (the " **New Plans** "), each Continuing Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with or recognized by the Company
and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that
the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, (i) each Continuing Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans that are health and welfare plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan is analogous to a Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " **Old Plans** "), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing health benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents
to the extent such conditions would have been waived under the Old Plans in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.09(a)_, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, honor,
in accordance with its terms, each Company Benefit Plan and all obligations
thereunder, including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in

 



      
 

 



 

combination with any other event, including termination of employment). Parent
hereby agrees and acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger constitutes
a change of control, a change in control or corporate transaction, as the case
may be, for all purposes under any plan, agreement or arrangement set forth in
_Section 3.17(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.09_ shall (i) create any right in any
Continuing Employee to continued employment by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any Subsidiary thereof or (ii) require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any Subsidiary thereof to continue any Company Benefit Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination of any Company Benefit Plan
after the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section 6.09_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed as an amendment to any benefit plan of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective affiliate.

 



 

Section 6.10. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein, (ii) to satisfy all
conditions applicable to Parent and/or Acquisition Sub in such definitive
agreements that are within their control and (iii) subject to _Section
6.10(b)_, prepare any pro forma financial statements and other financial
information (other than the Required Information) necessary for the
preparation of a customary confidential information memorandum for senior
secured term loan financings, including all historical audited and unaudited
financial information (including pro forma financial information) or financial
information otherwise reasonably requested by the Financing Sources. In the
event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative
sources on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice
of any material breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall not permit any material
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter without first consulting
with the Company or, if such amendment would or would be reasonably expected
to materially delay Parents ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, without first obtaining the Companys prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has
not been obtained, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall continue to be obligated
to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ of this Agreement and to Parents rights
under _Section 8.01_, regardless of whether Parent and Acquisition Sub have
complied with all of their other obligations under this Agreement (including
their obligations under this _Section 6.10_).

 



 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide to Parent and Acquisition Sub, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use

 



      
 

 



 

its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to direct its Representatives, including legal and accounting, to
provide, in each case at Parents sole expense, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent that is customary in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or
alternative financing (collectively with the Financing, the " **Available
Financing** " it being understood that for purposes of this _Section 6.10_,
for the avoidance of doubt, Available Financing shall include any offering of
debt securities or incurrence of loans) ( _provided_ that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (it being understood and agreed that the actions
enumerated in the immediate succeeding sentence are customary in connection
with the arrangement of the Available Financing); provided, further, that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to
enter into any definitive agreement related to any proposed Debt Financing
that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective at or prior
to the Effective Time and neither the Company Board nor any of the boards of
directors of the Companys Subsidiaries (or equivalent bodies) shall be
required to approve any Debt Financing or agreements related thereto at or
prior to the Effective Time. Such cooperation shall include, but not be
limited to, using reasonable best efforts to, and subject to _Section
6.10(a)_:

 



 

(i) furnish, as promptly as reasonably practicable following Parents request,
with such pertinent and customary information, regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent to obtain the
Available Financing and with such other information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including information to be used in the preparation of one
or more information packages regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries) as is customary
for the arrangement or marketing of the Available Financing to assist in
preparation of customary offering or information documents or rating agency or
lender presentations relating to the Available Financing;

 



 

(ii) furnish all financial statements and other financial data and financial
information of the Company and its Subsidiaries for completed fiscal periods

"(ii)" above shall mean the " **Required Information** ");

 



 

(iii) assist Parent in connection with Parents preparation of pro forma

and senior management and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, of the Company), presentations and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the Available Financing;

 



 

(v) assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
bank information memoranda, and similar documents required in connection with
the Available Financing;

Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the
Available Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to
the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time;

 



 

(viii) execute and deliver any customary pledge and security documents
(subject to occurrence of the Effective Time), closing certificates and

(ix) direct accountants to consent to the use of their reports in any material
relating to the Available Financing;

 



 

(x) assist in (A) the negotiation, preparation and execution of one or more
credit agreements, indentures, purchase agreements, currency or interest
hedging agreements and/or (B) the amendment of any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries currency or interest hedging agreements, in each case, on terms
that are reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Available
Financing; _provided_ that no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such agreements or amendments shall be effective until
the occurrence of the Effective Time;

 



 

(xi) provide customary authorization letters with respect to the Required
Information;

 



 

(xii) arrange for customary payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments
of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing for the payoff, discharge

Agreement to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date:

 



 

(xiii) assisting Parent in obtaining corporate and facilities ratings for the
Debt Financing; and

 



 

(xiv) as soon as practicable, furnish written notice to Parent and Acquisition
Sub if the Company shall have Knowledge of (A) any facts as a result of which
a restatement of any financial statements for such financial statements to
comply with GAAP is probable or (B) that the Required Information ceases to be
Compliant; and

 



 

(xv) provide, at least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all

Parent at least nine (9) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument (other
than the authorization letters referred to above) shall be effective until the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or
other fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Available
Financing prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
consummation of the Merger shall not be conditioned on the obtaining of (or
the failure to obtain) the Debt Financing and, (ii) prior to any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, they shall continue to be
obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt Financing,
subject to the requirements of _Section 2.03_ and the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_.

 



 

(d) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide any indemnity in connection with any Debt Financing or any of the
foregoing prior to the Effective Time. The Company will be in compliance in
all material respects with the condition set forth in _Section 7.02(b)_ as it
relates to _Section 6.10_, unless (i) the Company has breached its
obligations under this _Section 6.10_ in any material respect, (ii) Parent
has provided to the Company written notice of such breach and (iii) and the
Company fails to cure such breach by the earlier of eight (8) Business Days

reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its

Except as a result of gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or, to the extent acting on their behalf, their
respective Representatives, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the its Subsidiaries and their Representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,

than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries).

 



 

(e) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Available Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall promptly,
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and

except to the extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arise out
of or result from (i) information provided by or on behalf of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives and/or (ii) gross negligence,
fraud or willful misconduct by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, as determined
by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 8.03_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

by Parent, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(ii)_, or (B) substantially concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(b)(ii)_ and as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination
_(provided_ that Parent shall have provided wiring instructions for such
payment or, if not, then such payment shall be paid promptly following

(ii) The Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent, net of any expenses
reimbursement previously paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section
8.03(a)_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or

entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Competing Acquisition
Transaction or any Competing Acquisition Transaction has been consummated. For
purposes of the foregoing, a " **Competing Acquisition Transaction** " shall
have the same meaning as an "Acquisition Transaction" except that all
references therein to "more than twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be
references to "more than fifty percent (50%)."

 



 

(iii) In the event that Parent or its designee shall receive full payment
pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_, together with reimbursement of any
applicable Expenses pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_, the receipt of the
applicable Termination Fee and Expense (if applicable) shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Acquisition Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any
of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 8.03(b)_
shall limit the rights of Parent and Acquisition Sub under _Section 9.08_.
The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

 



 

(c) _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement but subject to _Section 9.08_ and the proviso to this sentence,
Parents right to receive payment from the Company of (i) Expenses pursuant to
_Section 8.03(a)_ and/or (ii) the applicable Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.03(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Acquisition Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " **Company
Related Parties** ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise, and upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of fraud or its willful and
material breach of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the aggregate
amount of any damages determined by a court to be payable by the Company
pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by the amount of any
Expenses and Termination Fee previously paid to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 8.03_.

 



 

Section 8.04. _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ , that
in the event that this Agreement has been adopted by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stockholders in accordance with the DGCL, no amendment shall be made
to this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders
under Delaware Law without such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Section 8.03(c)_, this _Section 8.04_, _Section
9.08_, _Section 9.09_, _Section 9.10_ and _Section 9.13_ (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or
modification of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise
modified in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to any
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source
party to the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

Section 8.05. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to
the Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance

parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

Section 9.03. _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties, except that Parent and Acquisition Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its respective rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliates, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent, Acquisition Sub or Guarantor of any of their obligations
hereunder; _provided_ , if such assignment would or would be reasonably
expected to materially delay Parents ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent must obtain the Companys prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be null and
void.

 



 

Section 9.04. _Confidentiality_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
hereby acknowledge that JAB Holding Company S.a r.l. and the Company have
previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, made as of November 23, 2015
(as amended, the " **Confidentiality Agreement** "), which will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 9.05. _Entire Agreement_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided,
however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and
effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date
on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or
is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR ANY
OF THEIR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE
ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), OR AS TO THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE BY)
BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE
TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders of Company Shares (other
than Cancelled Company Shares), Company Options, Company Restricted Stock
Units, Company PSU Awards and Company Deferred Cash Awards immediately prior
to the Effective Time) and _Section 6.08_ (which shall be for the benefit of
the Indemnified Parties and their heirs), (ii) the rights of the Financing
Sources of the Debt Financing set forth in _Section 9.09(c)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Financing Sources are hereby made express third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 9.06, _Section 9.08_, _Section 9.09(a)_,
_Section 9.09(c)_, _Section 9.10_ and _Section 9.13(b)_.

 



 

Section 9.07. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will

 



      
 

 



 

achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

Section 9.08. _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (in the courts described in _Section 9.09(a)_) without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in
_Section 8.03_ (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for
the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not
be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any partys right
to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. Each of the parties agrees that, (x) the seeking of remedies
pursuant to this _Section 9.08_ shall not in any way constitute a waiver by
any party seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of relief
that may be available to it under this Agreement in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this _Section 9.08_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, (y)
nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require a party to institute any
Legal Proceeding for (or limit a partys right to institute any Legal
Proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 9.08_ prior, or as a
condition, to exercising any termination right under _ARTICLE VIII_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any
Legal Proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this _Section 9.08_ or anything
set forth in this _Section 9.08_ restrict or limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _ARTICLE VIII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter and (z) no party shall require the other to post any bond or other
security as a condition to institute any Legal Proceeding for specific
performance under this _Section 9.08_. Each of the parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (A) the other party has an adequate remedy
at law or (B) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or equity.

 



 

Section 9.09. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding

of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with _Section
9.02_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section 9.09_ shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not
have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court
within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy arises
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (iii)
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise any claim (A) that it is not
personally subject to the personal jurisdiction of such court or (B) that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise); (iv) agrees that any actions or
proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal or other state court within the State of
Delaware); (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action
or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or
claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than
the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees
that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided
above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 9.09(b)_, each of the parties hereto hereby
agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source, or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction located within the, Borough of Manhattan in the City of
New York, New York, whether a state or Federal court, and that the provisions
of _Section 9.10_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any
such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim, (ii)
service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed
to them at their respective addresses provided in _Section 9.09_, or in any
other manner permitted by applicable Law, shall be effective service of
process against them for any such Action brought in any such action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim, (iii) a final judgment in any such action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law and (iv) any such action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State
that would result in the application of the laws of any other State.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT,
ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

Section 9.11. _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The parties hereto agree
that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (ii) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 



 

Section 9.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all

Section 9.13. _Non-Recourse_.

 



 

(a) No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney, representative or affiliate of
any party hereto or of any of their respective Affiliates (unless such
Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement) shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations or liabilities of such
party arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions

breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that none of the Financing

irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not as a

and Acquisition Sub of all of Parents and Acquisition Subs respective
covenants, obligations, undertakings and liabilities

 



      
 

 



 

under this Agreement, including any indemnity obligations hereunder or
thereunder (collectively, the " **Guaranteed Obligations** "). The Guarantor
acknowledges that it is receiving benefits in connection with providing this
Guaranty pursuant to this _Section 9.14_ (this " **Guaranty** "). The
liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable.

 



 

(b) The Guarantor hereby waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or
proof of reliance by the Company upon this Guaranty or acceptance of this
Guaranty. When pursuing its rights and remedies under this Guaranty against
the Guarantor, the Company shall be under no obligation to pursue such rights
and remedies it may have against Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Person
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with respect
thereto, and any failure by the Company to pursue such other rights or
remedies or to collect any payments from Parent, Acquisition Sub or any such
other Person or to realize upon or to exercise any such right of offset, and
any release by the Company of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any such other Person
or any right of offset, shall not relieve the Guarantor of any Liability under
this Guaranty, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether
express, implied or available as a matter of Law, of the Company. Furthermore,

of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, protest,
promptness, obligation to protect, secure or perfect any security interest,
notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, all defenses that
may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other
similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshaling of
assets of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Person interested in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all suretyship defenses
generally (in each case, other than any defense that Parent or Acquisition Sub
may have that payment of all applicable Guaranteed Obligations has been made
and all other applicable Guaranteed Obligations have been performed and
satisfied, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement).

 



 

(c) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to
exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against Parent
or Acquisition Sub or any other Person liable with respect to any of the
