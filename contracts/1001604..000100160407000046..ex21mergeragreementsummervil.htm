NOW  THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants,  promises and the mutual agreements contained herein, the Parties
agree as  follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

** ARTICLE I**

 

 

**THE  MERGER**

 

 

1.1 _The  Merger_.  Upon  and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Transitory  Subsidiary shall merge with and into the Company
at the Effective Time. From  and  after the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of the Transitory  Subsidiary shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the Surviving  Corporation. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 251 of  the DGCL.

 

 

1.2 _The  Closing_.  The  Closing shall take place at the offices of
Riddell Williams P.S., 1001  Fourth Avenue, Suite 4500, Seattle, WA 98154,
commencing at 9:00 a.m.  local time on the Closing Date. The "Closing Date"
shall be two (2) business  days after the satisfaction or waiver of all of
the conditions to the  obligations of the Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby  (excluding the delivery at the Closing of
any of the documents set forth in  _Article V_),  or  such other date as
may be mutually acceptable to the Parties.

 

 

1.3 _Actions  at the Closing_. 

 

 

(a) At  the  Closing:

 

 

(i) The  Company shall deliver to Parent and the Transitory Subsidiary the
various  certificates, instruments and documents referred to in _Section
__5.2_ ;

 

 

(ii) Parent  and the Transitory Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company the
various  certificates, instruments and documents referred to in _Section
__5.3_ ; 

 

 

(iii) The  Surviving Corporation shall file with the Secretary of State of
the State of  Delaware the Certificate of Merger;

 

 

(iv) Parent  shall issue and/or deliver to the Exchange Agent, the Merger
Consideration  and  cash sufficient to make the payments required by
_Section __1.6(d)_   and  _1.6(e)_ ;

 

 

(v) Parent  shall issue and/or deliver to each employee of the Company
entitled thereto  (the "Participating Employees") such employee's share of
the Employee Participation  Amount in either shares of Parent Common Stock or
cash as provided in  _Section __1.6(e)_ ;

 

 

(vi) Each  outstanding Company Warrant and Company Option, and any Company
Stock Plan,  shall be terminated at or prior to the Effective Time;

 

 

(vii) Parent  shall pay to Apollo the Apollo Debt Repayment and the Company
shall cause Apollo  to surrender to Parent the original promissory notes in
respect of the Apollo  Debt Repayment marked "canceled" and deliver to Parent
an investment  representation substantially similar to the representation set
forth in  _Section __6.7_ ;  and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

(viii) On  the  Closing Date, Parent shall file a registration statement on
Form S-8, or  any successor form, to register any portion of the Employee
Participation Amount  issued in shares pursuant to _Section __1.3(a)(v)_. 

 

 

(b) The  Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from  amounts otherwise payable in accordance with this Agreement to
the Participating  Employees such amounts as the Parent or the Exchange Agent
reasonably believes  is required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such  payment under the Code or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law.  To  the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing  authority by the Parent or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall  be  treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder  of  the shares of Company Stock
or the Participating Employees in respect of which  such deduction and
withholding was made by the Parent or the Exchange Agent.  Each Participating
Employee whose portion of the Employee Participation Amount  is paid in
shares of Parent Common Stock shall have the number of shares to  be 
received reduced by the number of shares required to satisfy Parent or
Exchange  Agent's withholding obligation under the Code or any provision of
state, local  or foreign Tax law calculated based on the average of the daily
market prices  of  the Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive
trading days ending three  (3) trading days prior to the Closing. The market
price for each such trading  day shall be the last sales price on such day as

such Certificate  shall receive in exchange therefore the Merger
Consideration for which the  shares formerly held by such holder are to be
exchanged in accordance with  _Section __1.6_ ,  and the  Certificates so

Certificate is properly  endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and the Person requesting  such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Tax
required by reason of the  payment to a Person other than the registered

such Tax has been paid or is not  applicable.

 

 

(c) All  cash  and/or shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the
surrender of Certificates  in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ 
shall be  deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the  shares of Company Stock represented by such certificates,
and there shall be  no  further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving  Corporation of the shares of Company Stock
which were outstanding immediately  prior to the Closing. If, after the

or any of their  respective Affiliates or the Exchange Agent shall be liable
to any person in  respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock or cash
delivered to a public  official in accordance with any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or other  similar law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered prior to three  (3) years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date  on  which any amounts payable in
accordance with this _Article I_  would  otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any  such amounts shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the  property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest  of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

reasonably request,  the payment to the Exchange Agent by such holder of any
indemnity/surety bond  in  such amount as required by the Exchange Agent and
the payment to the Exchange  Agent by such holder of any handling or other
fee required by the Exchange  Agent, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or  destroyed Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect thereto  in accordance with _Section
__1.6_.

 

 

1.8 _Dissenting  Shares_.  Upon  consummation of the Merger, Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into or  represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, if any, but shall  instead be converted into the right
to receive such consideration as may be  determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to  Section 262 of the DGCL. After the
Effective Time, if a Company Stockholder  forfeits or withdraws his, her or
its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares,  then, as of the occurrence of
such event, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall  cease to be Dissenting
Shares, and each share of Company Stock held by such  formerly dissenting
stockholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted  into the right
to receive and become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time,  the Merger
Consideration specified and allocated in _Section __1.6_.  The  Company
shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for  payment of
Company Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and any  written demands
for appraisal of any Company Stock, withdrawals of such demands,  and any
other

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 


 

instruments  that relate to such demands received by the Company and (b) the

demands for appraisal  under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent  of  Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal of  Company Stock, (ii) offer to settle or settle any
such demands or  (iii) waive any failure by a former stockholder of the
Company to timely  deliver a written objection or to perform any other act
perfecting appraisal  rights in accordance with applicable law.

 

 

1.9 _No  Further Rights_.  From  and after the Effective Time, no Company
Stock shall be deemed to be  outstanding, and holders of certificates
formerly representing Company Stock  shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto except as provided herein  or  by law.

 

 

1.10 _Closing  of Transfer Books_.  At the  Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and  no  transfer of Company
Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective  Time, certificates
formerly representing Company Stock are presented to Parent  or the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the  Merger
Consideration, if any, in accordance with _Section __1.6_.

to carry on the businesses in which it is engaged and to own,  lease or
otherwise use the properties owned, leased and used by it. The Company  has

Subsidiary of the Company are  duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid
and nonassessable. There are no  outstanding or authorized options, warrants,
rights, agreements, preemptive  rights, or commitments to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a  party or which are binding on any of them

3.8 _SEC  Filings; Parent Financial Statements_. 

 

 

(a) Parent  has filed each report and definitive proxy statement (together
with all  amendments thereof and supplements thereto) required to be filed by
it with  the  SEC since January 1, 2004 (as such documents have since the
time of their  filing been amended or supplemented, the "Parent SEC

to any amendments or  supplements thereto filed prior to the date hereof, (i)
each Parent SEC  Report complied as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of  the  Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and (ii) none of  the Parent SEC Reports contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or  omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary  in  order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances  under which they were made, not misleading. To
the extent required by the  Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and pursuant
to the rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder, each Parent SEC Report
contained the required disclosure  of transactions with, or for the benefit
of, any officer or director or  beneficial owner of more than 5% of the

or any national securities exchange or quotation  service.

consistent basis throughout  the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or,  in  the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and  each presents fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial  position, results of operations and
cash flows of Parent and its consolidated  Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods  indicated therein, except as
otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case  of  unaudited statements, to
normal year-end adjustments and the absence of complete  footnotes).

 

 

(c) Parent  has furnished to the Company a complete and correct copy of any
amendments  or  modifications, which have not yet been filed with the SEC
but which are required  to be filed, to agreements, documents or other
instruments that previously  had  been filed by Parent with the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Act or the Exchange  Act.

ensure  that material information relating to the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, is made  known to the management of Parent by others within
those entities and (y) a  system of internal control over financial reporting
sufficient to provide  reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and  the  preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with  GAAP, and (ii) has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation prior to  the date hereof, to Parent's auditors
and the audit committee of the Parent's  Board of Directors (A) any
significant deficiencies in the design or  operation of internal controls
which could adversely affect Parent's ability to  record, process, summarize
and report financial data and have identified for  Parent's auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any  fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees  who  have a
significant role in the Parent's internal controls. Parent has Made 
Available to the Company a summary of any such disclosure made by management 
to  Parent's auditors and audit committee.

 

 

(f) Except  as  set forth in the Parent SEC Reports, since January 1, 2004,
Parent has not  received any oral or written notification of a "reportable
condition" or "material weakness" in Parent's internal controls (as defined
in the Statements  of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on the date
hereof).

 

 

3.9 _No  Parent Material Adverse Effect_.  Since  December 31, 2006, there
has not been any Parent Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

3.10 _Parent  Licenses_.  Except  as set forth in _Section __3.10_   of
the  Parent Disclosure Letter, the Parent Facilities have all material
permits,  licenses, regulatory approvals, and comparable authorizations

governmental  authorities that have jurisdiction over any aspect of Parent
Facilities or  over  the operation thereof necessary for the use, operation
and maintenance of the  Parent Facilities in its current use and conduct as
an assisted living facility.  Parent or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
is the holder of all of the Parent  Licenses.

 

 

3.11 _Real  Property_.  _Section __3.11_   of the  Parent Disclosure
Letter contains a list of all real property and interests  in  real property
owned in fee by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent  Owned Real
Property"). Parent or one of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable  title
to each parcel of Parent Owned Real Property free and clear of all liens, 
except (i) liens which are reflected in the Parent Financial Statements, 
(ii) liens which arose in the Ordinary Course of Business, and  (iii) zoning
and building restrictions, easements, covenants, rights-of-way  and other
similar restrictions of record, none of which materially impairs  the 
current or proposed use of such Parent Owned Real Property. There are no 
outstanding options or rights of first refusal to purchase such parcel of
Parent  Owned Real Property, or any portion thereof or interest therein.

 

 

3.12 _Absence  of Notices_.  Except  as disclosed in _Section __3.12_   of
the  Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent has not received any written notice,
and has  no  Knowledge, that any material customer or supplier of Parent
intends to  discontinue, substantially alter prices or terms to, or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 


 

significantly  diminish its relationship with the Parent, its Subsidiaries or
the Parent  Facilities as a result of the transaction contemplated hereby
or  otherwise.

__3.13_   of the  Parent Disclosure Letter:

 

 

(a) _No  Labor Actions_.  No  labor strike, picketing action, dispute,
slowdown or stoppage, or unfair labor  practices are actually pending or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, threatened  against, or involving, Parent, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of the Parent  Facilities.

 

 

(b) _No  Bargaining Agreements_.  Neither  Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining  agreement, and no
collective bargaining agreement is currently being negotiated  by Parent.

 

 

(c) _WARN  Act_.  Neither  Parent nor Transitory Subsidiary has any present
plans or intentions to carry  out, following the Closing, any plant closing
or mass layoff which would violate  the WARN Act at any of the Company
Facilities (assuming for purposes of this  subsection that no notice would be
given in connection with any such closing  or  layoff).

 

 

3.14 _Employee  Benefit Plans_.  No  option was granted under any Parent
Plan with an exercise price which, on the  date of grant, was less than "fair
market value" (within the meaning of the 409A  Authorities). Each Parent Plan
that is a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation  Plan  has been operated in
material compliance with Section 409A of the Code  since January 1, 2005,
based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation  of the 409A Authorities.
No Parent Plan that would otherwise be a Nonqualified  Deferred Compensation
Plan but for the effective date provisions that are  applicable to Section
409A of the Code (as set forth in Section 885 of  the AJCA) has been
"materially modified " within the meaning of  Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the
AJCA after October 3, 2004, as determined  on the basis of a good faith,
reasonable interpretation of the AJCA and the  409A  Authorities.

 

 

3.15 _Inventory  and Supplies_.  As of  the date of this Agreement and at
the Closing, the Parent's Inventories are and  will be in sufficient quantity
and condition for the normal operation of its  business at the Parent
Facilities and in compliance with all requirements of  Governmental Entities.

 

 

3.16 _Brokers '  Fees_.  Except  as set forth in _Section __3.16_   of
the  Parent Disclosure Letter, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any  liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker,
finder  or  agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement.

 

 

3.17 _Taxes_.

 

 

(a) Parent  and each of its Subsidiaries has filed (or has had filed on their
behalf) on  a  timely basis all Tax Returns that such entity was required to
file, and all  such  Tax Returns were complete and accurate in all material
respects. Parent and  each  of its Subsidiaries has paid on a timely basis
all material Taxes that were  due  and payable. All material Taxes that
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or  was  required by law to withhold or
collect have been duly withheld or collected  and,  to the extent required,
have been paid to the proper Governmental

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Entity,  and have been properly reported as required under applicable
information  reporting requirements.

 

 

(b) Parent  or  the relevant Subsidiary has paid all deficiencies resulting
from any examination  or audit relating to Taxes. The federal and material
state income Tax Returns  of  Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are closed
by the applicable statute of  limitations for all taxable years through 1999.
No examination or audit of  any  Tax Return of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity  is  currently in progress or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, threatened or contemplated  and neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been informed in writing  by  any jurisdiction
that the jurisdiction believes that Parent or any such  Subsidiary was
required to file any Tax Return that was not filed. Neither  Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with  respect to
Taxes or agreed to an extension of time with respect to a Tax  assessment or
deficiency, or executed any power of attorney with respect to  any  Tax
matter that is currently in force.

 

 

(c) There  are  no liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of Parent or
any of its  Subsidiaries, except for liens arising as a matter of law
relating to current  Taxes not yet due and liens which would not reasonably
be expected to have  a  Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(d) Neither  Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take
any action that  would prevent the Merger from constituting a reorganization
within the meaning  of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent is not aware of any
agreement, plan  or other circumstance that would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a  reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the 
Code.

 

 

(e) Parent  has not been a United States real property holding corporation
within the  meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code during the applicable
period  specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code except as to
persons  owning, during the relevant testing period, more than five percent
(5%) of  any  class of Parent stock traded on an established securities
market. The charges,  reserves and accruals on the books and records of
Parent and its Subsidiaries  for Taxes are adequate (determined in accordance
with GAAP) and are equal to  or  greater than the Tax liabilities of Parent
and its Subsidiaries to which such  charges, reserves and accrual relate.

 

 

3.18 _Disclaimer_.  Except  as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the
Parent Related Documents, Parent  and Transitory Subsidiary make no
representations or warranties, express or  implied, at law or in equity, in
respect of Parent, each of its Subsidiaries,  or  any of their respective
assets, liabilities or operations, including, without  limitation, with
respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular  purpose, and any
such other representations or warranties are hereby expressly  disclaimed.

39  

 

 

 

 

 

4.6 _Indemnification  and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) Parent  shall not, for a period of six years after the Closing, take any
action to  unilaterally alter or impair any exculpatory or indemnification
provisions  now  existing in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
the Company or any  other contract or agreement between or among the Company

individual who served as  a  director or officer of the Company at any time
prior to the Closing, except  for  any changes which may be required to

the application of such provisions to acts  or  omissions of such
individuals prior to the Closing.

liabilities or amounts paid in  settlement incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding  or  investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising  out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing  based directly or
indirectly on, or arising directly or indirectly out of,  the  fact that
such Indemnified Executive is an officer or director of the Company,  whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest  extent
permitted under Delaware law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation  shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under 
Delaware law, provided the Indemnified Executive to whom expenses are

indemnification).

 

 

(c) The  Company will use Reasonable Best Efforts to maintain in full force
and effect  through the Closing Date all material insurance policies
applicable to the  Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
properties and assets in  effect on the date hereof. If and as requested by
Parent, the Company will  use  its Reasonable Best Efforts to cause the
Company's insurers to waive any  provisions in such insurance policies that
would allow the insurer to terminate  or adversely modify coverage upon
consummation of the Merger.

 

 

4.7 _WARN  Act_.  Parent  shall not, and shall not cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of its  Subsidiaries to, at any time within the seventy

law, affecting in whole or in part  any  site of employment, facility,
operating unit or employee of the Company or  its  Subsidiaries, without
complying with the notice requirements and all other  provisions of the WARN
Act and any similar law.

 

 

4.8 _Parent  Major Shareholders_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  the Parent Major Shareholders represents and warrants,
severally and not  jointly, that _Section __4.8_   of the  Parent
Disclosure Letter sets forth the number of shares of Parent Common Stock 
(the "Parent Shares"), of which each Parent Major Shareholder is the record
or  beneficial owner as of the date of this Agreement. Each of the Parent
Major  Shareholders further represents and warrants, severally and not
jointly, that  he  or it has the power to vote all Parent Shares owned by it
without restriction  and that no proxies heretofore given in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 


 

respect  of any or all of such Parent Shares are irrevocable and that any
such proxies  have heretofore been revoked.

Parent Shares owned by it, or any interest  therein, or any other securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Parent  capital stock, or any voting
rights with respect thereto or enter into any  contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect thereto  (including any voting
trust or agreement and the granting of any proxy), other  than: (i) pursuant
to the Merger or the terms of this Agreement,  (ii) to an Affiliate agreeing
to be bound hereby or (iii) with the  prior written consent of the Company.

 

 

(d) If  it is  ever held by any court of competent jurisdiction that the
restrictions placed  on  any Party to this Agreement by _Section __4.8_  
are too  onerous and are not necessary for the protection of the other Party
or Parties  hereto, each Party to this Agreement agrees that any court of
competent  jurisdiction may impose lesser restrictions which such court may
consider to  be  necessary or appropriate to properly protect the other
Party or Parties  hereto.

 

 

4.9 _Notification_.  Each of  the Company and Parent shall notify the other
Party in writing of the existence  or happening of any fact, event or
occurrence which should be included in the  Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, in order  to make the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article II_  or  _Article
III_,  as  applicable, true and correct in all material respects as of the
Closing Date,  it  being understood and agreed that the delivery of such
information shall not  in  any manner constitute a waiver by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, of  any  of the conditions precedent to the Closing
hereunder; provided, however, that  in  determining whether there is a
breach of any representation or warranty  contained in _Article II_  or 
_Article III_,  as  applicable, for purposes of the indemnification to be
provided by Indemnifying  Party pursuant to _Article VI_,  such 
representation or warranty shall be qualified by any information provided

of shares of  Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. The Company shall
furnish all  information concerning itself as Parent may reasonably request
in connection  with such actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement.

 

 

(b) Parent  shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity

41  

 

 

 

 

 


 

amendment  or supplement with the SEC, and reasonable and good faith
consideration shall  be  given to any comments made by the Company and its
counsel. Parent shall  (i) promptly provide the Company and its counsel with
any comments or other  communications, whether written or oral, that it or
its counsel may receive  from  time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement  promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and  (ii) provide the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in  the response to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to  which reasonable and good faith consideration
shall be given).

 

 

(c) The  information supplied by the Company and Parent, as applicable, for
inclusion  in  the Proxy Statement shall not, (i) at the time the Proxy
Statement (or any  amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed
to the Parent  Shareholders or (ii) at the time of the Parent Shareholders'
Meeting,  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state
any material  fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

event or  circumstance relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the
case of the  Company, or to Parent and its Subsidiaries, in the case of
Parent, or their  respective officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent  that should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement  so that any of such documents will not
contain any untrue statement of a  material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make  the  statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading, the Company
or Parent, as applicable, shall promptly inform  the  other Party. All
documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC  in  connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement
will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with  the 
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

 

 

4.11 _Meeting  of Parent Shareholders_.

 

 

(a) As  promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall call,
convene and  hold a meeting of the Parent Shareholders to consider the
approval of the  issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger. Parent shall  (i) use its Reasonable Best Efforts to solicit from the
Parent Shareholders  proxies in favor of the adoption of the issuance of
shares of Parent Common  Stock pursuant to the Merger, and secure the vote of
the Parent Shareholders  required by the rules of the American Stock Exchange
and the WBCA, to obtain  such approvals, and (ii) otherwise comply with all
legal requirements  applicable to such meeting.

 

 

(b) (i) The  Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend that the Parent

shall include a  statement that the Board of Directors of Parent has
recommended that the Parent  Shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of
the issuance of shares of Parent  Common Stock pursuant to the Merger;

directors, employees,  accountants, counsel and other agents
("Representatives") reasonable access  during normal business hours to its
employees, properties, assets and records,  during the period prior to the

other Party may reasonably request. Each of  the  Company and Parent shall
furnish to the other Party all such documents and  copies of documents and
records and information with respect to itself and  its  Subsidiaries and

reasonably request. Nothing in this _Section __4.12_   shall  require the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, to provide any access, or  to 
disclose any information, if permitting such access or disclosing such 
information would (i) violate applicable law, (ii) violate any of its 
obligations with respect to confidentiality (provided that each Party shall, 
upon the request of the other Party, use its Reasonable Best Efforts to
obtain  the required consent of any third party to such access or
disclosure), or  (iii) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
(provided that each  Party shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to allow for
such access or  disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client  privilege). Each of the Company and Parent also will consult
with the other  Party regarding its business on a regular basis.

 

 

(b) At  least  three weeks prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide
to Parent for each  employee of the Company and for each Resident,

Disclosure Letter (the "Employee Participation Amount").

 

 

4.15 _Section 16_. 

 

 

(a) Provided  that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information
in a timely  fashion, prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
Parent, or  an  appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt resolutions  consistent with the interpretative guidance of the
SEC so that the receipt  by  any officer or director of the Company who may
become a covered Person of Parent  for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act ("Section 16") of  shares of Parent Common Stock upon exchange of shares
of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Company  Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and to the extent
such  securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, shall be an
exempt  transaction for purposes of Section 16\. "Section 16 Information"
shall  mean, with respect to each officer or director of the Company who may
become  a  covered Person of Parent for purposes of Section 16, the number
of shares  of Company Stock held by each such officer or director and

the disposition of shares  of  Company Stock pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger by any officer or  director of the Company who is a covered Person
of the Company for purposes  of  Section 16 shall be an exempt transaction
for purposes of  Section 16.

within the  meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations
promulgated  under the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement, each
party hereto  shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify, and will  not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be
taken, fail to take any  action or cause any action to fail to be taken which
action or failure to act  would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a  reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the  Code.

terminated at  or  prior to the Effective Time.

the provisions of  Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent,
Transitory Subsidiary  and the Company will be a party to the reorganization
within the meaning of  Section 368(b) of the Code, which opinion shall not
have been withdrawn or  modified in any material respect. The issuance of
such opinion shall be  conditioned on receipt by Riddell Williams of
representation letters from each  of Parent and the Company as contemplated
in _Section __4.16_   of this  Agreement. Each such representation letter
shall be dated on or before the  date  of such opinion and shall not have
been withdrawn or modified in any

material  respect as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
if Parent's counsel does not render such opinion, this condition  shall
nevertheless be deemed satisfied if Morgan Lewis, counsel to the Company, 
renders such opinion in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

Company to consummate the Merger is subject to the  satisfaction (or waiver
by the Company) of the following additional  conditions;  provided, however,
that the conditions set forth in _Section __5.3(b)_ ,  _(d)_ ,  _(e)_
_(iii)_ ,  _(g)_ ,  and  _(h)_   shall be  deemed waived by the Company,
unless the failure to meet such conditions is  likely to result in aggregate
Damages to the Company in excess of  $20,000,000.  No such  deemed waiver
shall limit Indemnified Securityholders' right to seek  indemnification
pursuant to _Article VI_.

 

 

(a) The  Parent Shareholder Approval shall have been obtained;

 

 

(b) Parent  and its Subsidiaries shall have obtained at their own expense

by _Section __4.2_ ,  with  respect to Governmental Entities, which are
required on the part of Parent  or  its Subsidiaries, except for (i) any
waivers, permits, consents, approvals,  licenses or other authorizations
which may be delivered or issued subsequent  to  the Closing Date pursuant
to applicable law, rule or regulation relating to  such  waiver, permit,
consent, approval, license or other authorization; and  (ii) any failure to
provide the appropriate notice or obtain the  appropriate permit,
authorization, consent or approval, or where any such  conflict, breach,
default, acceleration, termination, modification or  cancellation, or any
such imposition of any Security Interest, has not had  or  would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,  a  Parent
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability  of  the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement;

 

 

(c) The  representations and warranties of Parent and the Transitory
Subsidiary set  forth  in this Agreement that are qualified as to
materiality shall be true and correct  and the representations and warranties
of Parent and the Transitory Subsidiary  that are not qualified as to
materiality shall be true and correct in all  material respects, in each
case, as of the Closing as though made as of the  Closing, provided that, to
the extent that any such representation or warranty  speaks as of a specified
date, it need only be true and correct as of such  specified date, and Parent
shall have delivered to the Company an unaudited  consolidated balance sheet
of Parent and unaudited consolidated statements  of  income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the period ended as  of last day of
the month prior to the month of the Closing;

 

 

(d) Each  of  Parent and the Transitory Subsidiary shall have performed or
complied with  in  all material respects its agreements and covenants
required to be performed  or  complied with under this Agreement as of or
prior to the Closing;

 

 

(e) No  Legal  Proceeding shall be pending or threatened wherein an
unfavorable judgment,  order, decree, stipulation or injunction would (i)
prevent consummation 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 


 

of  the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) cause the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement to be rescinded following
consummation, or  (iii) have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse  Effect;

 

 

(f) Parent  shall have delivered, or Made Available, to the Company the
Parent Certificate; 

 

 

(g) The  Company shall have received such other certificates and instruments
(including  certificates of good standing of Parent and the Transitory
Subsidiary in their  jurisdiction of organization, certified charter
documents, certificates as  to  the incumbency of officers and the adoption
of authorizing resolutions) as  it  shall reasonably request in connection
with the Closing;

 

 

(h) There  shall have been no Parent Material Adverse Effect; provided,
however, that  none  of the following shall be deemed, either alone or in
combination, to constitute,  and none of the following shall be taken into
account in determining whether  there has been a Parent Material Adverse
Effect: (i) any failure by Parent  or its Subsidiaries to meet any internal
or published projections, forecasts,  or  revenue or earnings predictions
for any period ending on or after the date  of  this Agreement; (ii) any
adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state  of facts or development to
the extent attributable to the announcement or  pendency of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) to the  extent that they do not have a
materially disproportionate effect on Parent  and  its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, any adverse change, effect, event,  occurrence, state of facts or
development attributable to conditions affecting  (A) the industry(ies) in
which Parent or its Subsidiaries operate,  (B) the U.S. securities or
financial markets, (C) the U.S. economy as  a whole, or (D) the economy of
any foreign country as a whole; or  (iv) any adverse change, effect, event,
occurrence, state of facts or  development resulting from (1) the taking of
any action required by this  Agreement, (2) any change in accounting
requirements or principles or any  change in applicable laws, rules or
regulations or the interpretation or  enforcement thereof, (3) something
attributable to the acts or omissions  of, the Company, (4) the acts or
omissions of, or on behalf of, the  Company, or (5) to the extent that they
do not have a materially  disproportionate effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, acts  of  war, terrorism, or other conflict.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event  the average of the daily market
prices of the Parent Common Stock for any five  (5) consecutive trading days
is less than $12.50, a Parent Material Adverse  Effect shall be deemed to
have occurred. The market price for each such trading  day shall be the last
sales price on such day as reported on the consolidated  transaction
reporting system for the American Stock Exchange.

 

 

**(i)** The  Parties shall have entered into a registration rights agreement

Company,  based upon representations of Parent, Transitory Subsidiary and the

49  

 

 

 

 

 


 

of  Parent, Transitory Subsidiary and the Company will be a party to the 
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, which

representation letter shall be dated on or before the  date  of such opinion
and shall not have been withdrawn or modified in any material  respect as of
the Effective Time.

50  

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Parent  or  Transitory Subsidiary breaches any of its representations,
warranties, and  covenants contained in this Agreement and the Parent Related
Documents;  or

 

 

(b) any  liability of the Company arising from events occurring after the
Closing Date,  (except to the extent of any indemnification by the Apollo
Stockholders pursuant  to _Section __6.1_ ).

 

 

6.3 _Indemnification  Claims_.

 

 

(a) (i)If  any  third party notifies any Indemnified Party with respect to
any matter (a "Third  Party Claim ") that may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against an  Indemnifying Party under _Article VI_,  then 
the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notification to the 
Indemnifying Party thereof. Such notification shall be given within ten (10) 
days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of such Third Party
Claim,  and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the
Indemnified  Party) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party
Claim and the  amount of the claimed damages (if available); provided,
however, that no delay  or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in so
notifying the Indemnifying  Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability or obligation  hereunder except to the extent of any damage or
liability caused by or arising  out of such failure.

 

 

(ii) The  Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the
Indemnified Party,  assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim
with counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that
(i) the Indemnifying  Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within
fifteen (15) days after  the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third
Party Claim that the  Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party
from and against the  Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting
from, arising out of,  relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third
Party Claim (subject  to  the provisions of this _Article VI_);  (ii) the
ad damnum is less than or equal to the amount of Damages for which  the
Indemnifying Party is liable under this _Article VI_;  (iii) the Indemnifying
Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence  acceptable to the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will have the  financial
resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its 
indemnification obligations hereunder; (iv) the Third Party Claim does not 
involve criminal liability and seeks only money damages and not equitable
relief  against the Indemnified Party; (v) settlement of, or an adverse
judgment  with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith
judgment of  the  Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential
custom or practice adverse  to the continuing business interests or the
reputation of the Indemnified Party,  and (vi) the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of the Third Party  Claim actively and diligently.

 

 

(iii) If  the  Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under the
terms hereof to,  so  assume control of the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party  shall control such defense.

 

 

(iv) The  Non-controlling Party may participate in such defense at its own
expense. The  Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised
of the status  of  such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall
consider in good faith  recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party
with respect thereto. The  Non-controlling

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Party  shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may
have with  respect to such Third Party Claim (including copies of any
summons, complaint  or  other pleading which may have been served on such
party and any written claim,  demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same)  and  shall otherwise cooperate with and
assist the Controlling Party in the defense  of such Third Party Claim. The
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the  Indemnified Party with
respect to a Third Party Claim shall be considered  Damages for purposes of
this Agreement if (x) the Indemnified Party  controls the defense of such
Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this  _Section __6.3(a)_   or 
(y) the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the 
Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the 
Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available 
with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 

 

(v) The  Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any  judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent  of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed;  provided that the consent of the Indemnified Party
shall not be required if  the  Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay
any amounts payable pursuant to  such  settlement or judgment and such
settlement or judgment includes a complete  release of the Indemnified Party
from further liability and has no other adverse  effect on the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any  settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party  Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall  not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

(b) Within  twenty (20) days after delivery of the notification of a Third
Party Claim  as  provided in _Section __6.3(a)(i)_   (a "Claim Notice"),
the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a  Response, in
which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the  Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which  case the Response
shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party  to  the
Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer),  (ii)
agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the Agreed  Amount
(in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the 
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check 
or by  wire transfer), or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to  receive any of the Claimed Amount.

 

 

(c) During  the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that
reflects a Dispute,  the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
use good faith efforts  to  resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not
resolved within such 30-day period,  the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall discuss in good faith  the  submission of the
Dispute to binding arbitration, and if the Indemnifying Party  and the
Indemnified Party agree in writing to submit the Dispute to such 
arbitration, then the provisions of _Section __6.3(d)_   shall  become
effective with respect to such Dispute. The provisions of this  _Section
__6.3(c)_   shall  not obligate the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party to submit to  arbitration or any other alternative dispute resolution
procedure with respect  to any Dispute, and in the absence of an agreement by
the Indemnifying Party  and  the Indemnified Party to arbitrate a Dispute,
such Dispute shall be resolved  in  a state or federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware, in accordance with  _Section __9.11_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

(d) If,  as  set forth in _Section __6.3(c)_ ,  the  Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party agree to submit any Dispute to  binding arbitration,
the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator  (the "Arbitrator")
in accordance with the Commercial Rules in effect from time  to time and the
following provisions:

 

 

(i) In  the  event of any conflict between the Commercial Rules in effect
from time to time  and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of
this Agreement shall  prevail and be controlling.

 

 

(ii) The  parties shall commence the arbitration by jointly filing a written
submission  with the Wilmington, Delaware office of the AAA in accordance
with Commercial  Rule 5 (or any successor provision).

 

 

(iii) No  depositions or other discovery shall be conducted in connection
with the  arbitration.

 

 

(iv) Not  later  than thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the
arbitration hearing, the  Arbitrator shall prepare and distribute to the
parties a writing setting forth  the arbitral award and the Arbitrator's
reasons therefor. Any award rendered by  the Arbitrator shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the parties, and  judgment thereon may be entered
and enforced in any court of competent  jurisdiction (subject to _Section
__9.11_ ),  provided that the Arbitrator shall have no power or authority to
(x) award  damages in excess of the portion of the Claimed Amount that is
subject to such  Dispute, (y) award multiple, consequential, punitive or
exemplary damages,  or (z) grant injunctive relief, specific performance or
other equitable  relief.

 

 

(v) The  Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under the Commercial
Rules or  otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of this
Agreement,  including the provisions of this _Section __6.3(d)_ ,  or  (y)
address or resolve any issue not submitted by the parties. 

 

 

(vi) In  connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this
Agreement, each  party shall bear its own costs and expenses, except that the
fees and costs  of  the AAA and the Arbitrator, the costs and expenses of
obtaining the facility  where the arbitration hearing is held, and such other
costs and expenses as  the  Arbitrator may determine to be directly related
to the conduct of the  arbitration and appropriately borne jointly by the
parties (which shall not  include any party's attorneys' fees or costs,
witness fees (if any), costs of  investigation and similar expenses) shall be
shared equally by the Indemnified  Party and the Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  the other provisions of this _Section __6.3_ ,  if a 
third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that an Indemnified 
Party  is liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which
may  constitute or result in Damages for which such Indemnified Party may be
entitled  to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VI_,  and  such
Indemnified Party reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason 
to fulfill such obligation, then (i) such Indemnified Party shall be 
entitled to satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or consent from 
the  Indemnifying Party, (ii) such Indemnified Party may subsequently make
a  claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

_Article VI_  and  (iii) such Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed, in
accordance with the  provisions of this _Article VI_,  for any  such
Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this 
_Article VI_  (subject  to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute
the Indemnified Party's  entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for
which it is entitled to  indemnification, under the terms of this _Article
VI_).

 

 

(f) For  purposes of this _Section __6.3_ ,  (i) if the Apollo Stockholders
comprise the Indemnifying Party, any  references to the Indemnifying Party
(except provisions relating to an  obligation to make any payments) shall be
deemed to refer to the Stockholder  Representative and (ii) if the
Indemnified Securityholders comprise the  Indemnified Party, any references
to the Indemnified Party (except provisions  relating to an obligation to
make or a right to receive any payments) shall  be  deemed to refer to the
Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder  Representative shall have full
power and authority on behalf of each Indemnified  Securityholder to take any
and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all  instruments on behalf of,
and execute or waive any and all rights of, the  Indemnified Securityholders
under this _Article VI_.  The  Stockholder Representative shall have no
liability to any Indemnified  Securityholder for any action taken or omitted
on behalf of the Indemnified  Securityholders pursuant to this _Article
VI_. 

 

 

6.4 _Survival  of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

 

 

(a) The  representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement
or any  certificate required to be delivered at Closing to Parent or
Transitory  Subsidiary, and the representations and warranties of Parent and
Transitory  Subsidiary or any certificate required to be delivered at Closing
to the  Company, and the covenants and agreements of the Company and Parent
which by  their terms do not contemplate performance after the Closing, shall
survive  the  Closing and remain in full force and effect for twenty (20)
months following  the  Closing Date.

 

 

(b) The  rights to indemnification set forth in this _Article VI_  shall 
not be affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of an 
Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) 
by an  Indemnified Party, whether before or after the Closing Date, with
respect to  the  inaccuracy or noncompliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or  obligation which is the subject of indemnification
hereunder or (ii) any  waiver by an Indemnified Party of any closing
condition relating to the accuracy  of representations and warranties or the
performance of or compliance with  agreements and covenants.

 

 

6.5 _Limitations_.

 

 

(a) The  Apollo Stockholders shall not have any obligation to indemnify
Parent from  and  against any Damages under _Section __6.1_ ,  other  than
Damages resulting by reason of any fraud or intentional misrepresentation, 
until the Parent Indemnitees have suffered Damages by reason of all such 
breaches in excess of a $2,000,000 aggregated deductible (after which point 
the  Apollo Stockholders will be obligated to indemnify the Parent
Indemnitees from  and against all such Damages, including the first
$2,000,000) and such  indemnification obligation shall not exceed $20,00,000
except in the case of  fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Parent  shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Securityholders  from  and against Damages under _Section __6.2_ ,  other 
than Damages resulting by reason of any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation,  until the Indemnified Securityholders have suffered
Damages by reason of all  such breaches in excess of a $2,000,000 aggregated
deductible (after which  point  Parent will be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Securityholders from  and  against all such Damages, including
the first $2,000,000) and such  indemnification obligation shall not exceed
$20,00,000 except in the case of  fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

 

 

(c) The  rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Article VI_  shall
be  the exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to any and
all  matters arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement,
the  Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective assets and
liabilities;  provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement,  nothing herein shall limit any claim of any Party for
remedies at law or in  equity for fraud or intentional misrepresentations.

 

 

(d) No  Apollo  Stockholder shall have any right of contribution against the
Company or the  Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by the
Company of any of its  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

 

 

(e) The  amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party under this
_Article VI_  shall be  reduced by any proceeds received by such Indemnified
Party or an Affiliate,  with  respect to the Damages to which such indemnity
claim relates, from an insurance  carrier or any third party. Each
Indemnified Party shall use its Reasonable  Best  Efforts to seek payment or
reimbursement for any Damages from its insurance  carrier or other collateral
sources. In the event that an Indemnified Party  shall receive funds from any
insurance carrier or collateral source with respect  to any Damages, any such
amounts so received shall be payable to the  Indemnifying Party, regardless
of when received by the Indemnified Party, up  to  such amount previously
paid by the Indemnifying Party or their Affiliates with  respect to such
Damages.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
following a determination  that the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party  pursuant to _Sections __6.1(a)_   or 
_6.2(a)_ ,  and  subject to the deductible amounts set forth in _Sections
__6.5(a)_   or  _6.5(b)_ ,  and  solely for purposes of determining the
amount of any Damages that are the  subject matter of a claim for
indemnification hereunder, each representation  and  warranty in this
Agreement and each certificate of document delivered pursuant  hereto shall
be read without regard and without giving effect to the term(s)  "material"
or "Material Adverse Effect" in each instance where the effect of  such
term(s) would be to make such representation and warranty less restrictive 
(as if such words and surrounding related words (e.g. "reasonably be
expected  to," "could have" and similar restrictions and qualifiers were
deleted from such  representations and warranty).

 

 

(g) To  the  extent that Parent's payment in cash of any indemnification
obligation of Parent  under _Section __6.2_   would  cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a reorganization under  Section 368(a) of the Code, such
indemnification obligation shall be paid  by Parent in the form of shares of
common stock of Parent having a fair market  value of any such
indemnification obligation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

6.6 _Treatment  of Indemnification Payments_.  The  Parties hereto agree to
treat all indemnification payments made pursuant to  this  _Article VI_ 
(including, without limitation, payments pursuant to _Sections __6.1_   and 
_6.2_ )  as  adjustments to the Merger Consideration for all income Tax
purposes and to  take  no position contrary thereto in any Tax Return or
audit or examination by,  or  proceeding before, any taxing authority,
except as required by a change in  law  or a "determination" as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code and the  Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 

 

6.7 _Investment_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  the Apollo Stockholders acknowledges that (a) it has been
furnished with  such documents, materials and information as it deems
necessary or appropriate  for evaluating an investment in Parent (including,
without limitation, Parent's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2006, all  reports filed by Parent under Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act since  December 31, 2006, and Parent's proxy statement dated
April 28, 2006)  and confirms that it has made such further investigation of
Parent as was deemed  appropriate to evaluate the merits and risks of an
investment in Parent and  (b) it has had the opportunity to ask questions of,
and receive answers  from, the officers of Parent and persons acting on
Parent's behalf concerning  the terms and conditions of the offering of the
Parent Common Stock pursuant  to  this Agreement. Each Apollo Stockholder is
acquiring the shares of Parent Common  Stock to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement solely for its own account for  purposes of investment, and has no
intention of selling such shares in violation  of the federal securities laws
or any applicable state securities laws. Each  of  the Apollo Stockholders
is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in  Rule 501(a) of
