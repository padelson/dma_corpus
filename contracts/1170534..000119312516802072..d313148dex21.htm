 _CALCULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT_

 

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_.

 

(a) The " _Estimated Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to (without
duplication):

 

(i) Three Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars ($350,000,000),

 

(ii) plus the Investments Note,

 

(iii) plus the Mitel Units,

 

(iv) plus the Working Capital Overage, if any,

 

(v) plus the Cash Amount Overage, if any,

 

(vi) plus the Advances, if any,

 



20 (vii) minus, without duplication, the sum of:

 

(A) the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses;

 

(B) the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount;

 

(C) the Cash Amount Underage, if any; and

 

(D) the Working Capital Underage, if any.

 

The Estimated Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment following the

(b) At the Closing provided for in _Article 3_ , upon the terms and subject to

and clear of all Liens excluding restrictions on transfer under applicable
securities Law, for an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price,
subject to _Section 2.1(d)_. The purchase and sale of the Shares is referred
to herein as the " _Acquisition_ ". The Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements are referred
to herein as the " _Transactions_ ".

(c) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer a good faith estimate of: (i) Reference Date
Working Capital prepared in accordance with Balance Sheet Rules and the
resulting Working Capital Overage or Working Capital Underage (the " _Working

accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules (the " _Estimated Assumed Indebtedness
Amount_ "); (iii) the Reference Date Cash Amount and the resulting
Cash Amount Overage or Cash Amount Underage (the " _Estimated Cash Amount_
"); (iv) the Advances (the " _Estimated Advances_ "); and (v) the Seller
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses_ "). The
Seller shall make a good faith effort to resolve any objections or disputes of
the Buyer regarding the calculation of the Working Capital Estimate, the
Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount, the Estimated Cash Amount,
the Estimated Advances and the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses, and
such calculations shall be subject to the written consent and approval of
Buyer (which consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); provided that the Closing shall not be delayed for more than two
(2) Business Days notwithstanding such consent and approval has not been
given.

(d) In the event there is any Working Capital Overage, such Working Capital
Overage shall not be payable at the Closing and instead the amount equal to
the Working Capital Overage shall be payable by the Buyer to the Seller no
later than sixty (60) days after the Closing unless such sixtieth (60th) day
is not a Business Day, in which case the next Business Day following such
sixtieth (60th) day. The obligations of the Buyer under this _Section 2.1(d)_
are absolute and are not contingent or conditional in any way.

 



21 Section 2.2 _Transactions to be Effected at the Closing_. At the Closing,
the following transactions shall be effected by the parties:

(a) The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer (i) the certificate(s) representing
the Shares marked cancelled and (ii) the newly issued certificate(s)

(b) The Buyer shall pay to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated in writing by the Seller (such
designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date) an

amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price _minus_ the Working Capital
Overage, if any.

(c) Investments shall deliver to the Seller the Investments Note duly executed
by Investments.

(d) Investments shall deliver to the Seller a certificate representing the

(h) Investments shall deliver to the Seller the Seller Joinder duly executed

(i) The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer the FIRPTA Certificate duly executed
by the Seller.

 

Section 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to
the Seller a statement (the " _Statement_ ") of the Reference Date Working
Capital, the Assumed Indebtedness, the Reference Date Cash Amount, the
Advances and the Seller Transaction Expenses in each case prepared in
accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules. The Buyer shall not amend,
supplement or modify the Statement following its delivery to the Seller. The
Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that no adjustments shall be made to the Base
Amount or the Base Cash Amount.

 

(b) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the
thirtieth (30th) day following the date on which the Statement was delivered
to the Seller, unless the Seller delivers written notice of its disagreement
with

 



22 the Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Buyer prior to such
date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the
nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include good faith
disagreements based on Reference Date Working Capital, Assumed Indebtedness,
the Reference Date Cash Amount, the Advances and/or Seller Transaction
Expenses not being calculated in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules. If a
Notice of Disagreement is received by the Buyer prior to the thirtieth (30th)
day following the date on which the Statement was delivered to the Seller,
then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become
final and binding upon the Seller and the Buyer on the earlier of (A) the date
the Seller and the Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the
date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting
Firm. During the fourteen (14)-day period following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, the Seller and the Buyer shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such
fourteen (14)-day period the Seller and the Buyer have not resolved in
writing the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the Seller and
the Buyer shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting
Firm_ ") for arbitration, in accordance with the standards set forth in this
_Section 2.3_, only matters that remain in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall
be Grant Thornton LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such
other internationally recognized independent public accounting firm or
valuation firm as shall be agreed upon by the Seller and the Buyer in writing.
The Seller and the Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting
Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to the
Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such submission. The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited
to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the items in dispute
were determined in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules and the Accounting
Firm is not to make any other determination, including any determination as to
whether the Base Amount, Working Capital Estimate, the Estimated Assumed
Indebtedness Amount, the Estimated Cash Amount, Estimated Advances or the
Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses are correct. The Accounting Firms
decision shall be based solely on written submissions by the Seller and the
Buyer and their respective Representatives and not by independent review and
shall be final and binding on all of the parties hereto. The Accounting Firm
may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed
by either party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either
party. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm
in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
incurred pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be borne pro rata as between
the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in proportion
to the final allocation made by such Accounting Firm of the disputed items
weighted in relation to the claims made by the Seller and the Buyer, such
that the prevailing party pays the lesser proportion of such fees, costs and
expenses.

 

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Working Capital_ " means the
Reference Date Working Capital, " _Final Seller Transaction Expenses_ " means
Seller Transaction Expenses, " _Final Cash Amount_ " means the Reference Date
Cash Amount, " _Final Assumed Indebtedness_ " means the Assumed

 



23 Indebtedness and " _Final Advances_ " means the Advances, in each case as
finally agreed or determined in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_. The
Estimated Purchase Price shall be recalculated as follows: (i) increased by
the sum of (1) the amount, if any, that the Final Working Capital exceeds the
Working Capital Estimate, (2) the amount, if any, that the Estimated Assumed
Indebtedness Amount exceeds the Final Assumed Indebtedness, (3) the amount, if
any, that Final Cash Amount exceeds the Estimated Cash Amount, (4) the amount,
if any, that the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses exceeds the Final
Seller Transaction Expenses; and/or (5) the amount, if any, that the Final
Advances exceeds the Estimated Advances; and (ii) decreased by the sum of (1)
the amount, if any, that the Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Final
Working Capital, (2) the amount, if any, that the Final Assumed Indebtedness
exceeds the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount, (3) the amount, if any,
that the Estimated Cash Amount exceeds the Final Cash Amount, (4) the amount,
if any, that the Final Seller Transaction Expenses exceeds the Estimated
Seller Transaction Expenses and/or (5) the amount, if any, that the Estimated
Advances exceeds the Final Advances (such recalculated amount, the " _Final
Purchase Price_ "). If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Purchase Price, the Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Working Capital, the Final Cash Amount, the Final Seller Transaction
Expenses, the Final Advances and the Final Assumed Indebtedness have been
determined, make payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the Seller in the amount of any such excess. If the Final Purchase Price is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price, the Seller shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Working Capital, the Final Cash Amount, the
Final Seller Transaction Expenses, the Final Advances and the Final
Assumed Indebtedness have been determined, make payment by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Buyer in the amount of any such deficit. If
the Final Purchase Price is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, neither the
Seller nor the Buyer shall be required to make any payment to the other party
under this _Section 2.3_. Upon payment of the amounts provided in this
_Section 2.3(c)_, none of the parties hereto may make or assert any claim
under this  _Section 2.3_.

(d) No actions taken by the Buyer on its own behalf or on behalf of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, on or following the Closing Date shall
be given effect for purposes of determining the Reference Date Working
Capital, Reference Date Cash Amount, Seller Transaction Expenses, the Advances
or Assumed Indebtedness. During the period of time from and after the Closing
Date through the final determination and payment of Reference Date Working
Capital, Reference Date Cash Amount, Seller Transaction Expenses, the Advances
and Assumed Indebtedness in accordance with this _Section 2.3_, the Buyer
shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to afford (subject to
execution of appropriate confidentiality agreements), to the Seller and any
accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by the Seller or its
Affiliates in connection with the review of Reference Date Working Capital,
Reference Date Cash Amount, Seller Transaction Expenses, the Advances and
Assumed Indebtedness in accordance with this _Section 2.3_, copies of or
reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice
to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel, Representatives (including
the Companys accountants) and records of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and such Representatives (including the work papers of the
Companys accountants to the extent permitted by the Companys

 



24  accountants) necessary to the review of the Statement and the Buyers
determination of Reference Date Working Capital, Reference Date Cash Amount,
Seller Transaction Expenses, the Advances and Assumed Indebtedness in
accordance with this _Section 2.3_.

Section 2.4 _Withholding_. Each of the Buyer, Investments, the Company
and any Company Subsidiary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Buyer,
the Company or such Company Subsidiary is required to withhold from such
consideration under the Code or any provision of other applicable Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and properly paid over to
the applicable Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. To the
extent that the Buyer becomes aware of any applicable withholding Taxes, the
Buyer (i) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide prompt written
notice to the Seller of the amount of such Tax and (ii) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the Seller in good faith as to the nature
of the Tax and the basis upon which such withholding is required. Each of the
Buyer and the Seller agrees to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain exemptions from, or reductions of, any Taxes required to be withheld
from payments under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 4

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER AND THE GUARANTOR_

 

The Seller and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Buyer, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as though made on
the Closing Date, except to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to another date (in which case as of such other date), as
follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Corporate Existence_. The Seller is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Law of the
State of Delaware. The Guarantor is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing (to the extent such concept exists) under the
Laws of Canada.

 



25 Section 4.2 _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Seller and the Guarantor of this Agreement and, to the
extent applicable, the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by the Seller
and the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated hereby and, to the extent
applicable, thereby are within the Sellers and the Guarantors corporate
power and authority. This Agreement and, to the extent applicable, the
Ancillary Agreements, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
other parties thereto, constitute valid and binding agreements of the Seller
and the Guarantor, to the extent applicable, enforceable against the Seller
and the Guarantor, to the extent applicable, in accordance with their terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or any other similar Law affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

Section 4.3 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Seller and the Guarantor of this Agreement and, to the
extent applicable, the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by the Seller
and the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated hereby and, to the extent
applicable, thereby require no action or approval by or in respect of, or
notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (a)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any non-U.S.
Competition Law and compliance with any applicable requirements and prior
authorization process pursuant to Article L.151-3 and articles R.153-1 and
seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code, and (b) any actions or filings
the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have an effect that would prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and, to the extent applicable, the Ancillary Agreements or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or, to the extent
applicable, thereby.

 

Section 4.4 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Seller and the Guarantor of this Agreement and, to the extent
applicable, the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by the Seller and
the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated hereby and, to the extent
applicable, thereby do not and will not (a) assuming the authorizations,
consents and approvals referred to in _Section 4.3_ are obtained, contravene,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Seller or the Guarantor, (b)
assuming the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in _Section
4.3_ are obtained, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or
breach of any provision of any applicable Law or Order, (c) assuming the
authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in _Section 4.3_ are
obtained, require any consent or other action by or notice to any Person
under, constitute a default or a violation, or an event that, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or a violation,
under or of, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or
other change or trigger of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit
to which the Seller or the Guarantor is entitled under, any provision of any
agreement or other instrument binding upon the Seller or the Guarantor or any
governmental license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other
similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or

 



26 business of the Seller or the Guarantor or (d) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien, other than any Permitted Liens, on any asset of the
Seller or the Guarantor, except, in the case of _clauses (b)_ , _(c)_ and
_(d)_ , which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an effect that would prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Seller or the Guarantor to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.5 _The Shares_. _Schedule 4.5_ sets forth the registered
ownership in the capital of the Company as of the date hereof. Other than the
shares in the capital of the Company listed on _Schedule 4.5_ , no Person has
any other equity interests or rights to acquire equity interests in the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The Seller has exclusive registered
title to the Shares set forth on _Schedule 4.5_ , free and clear of all Liens
with full right, power and authority to transfer, convey and deliver the
Shares, except (i) Permitted Liens against such Shares all of which will be
discharged on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) Liens on transfer imposed
under applicable securities Laws or under the certificate of incorporation of
the Company and (iii) Liens created by the Buyers or its Affiliates acts.
Assuming the Buyer has the requisite power and authority to be the lawful
owner of the Shares, upon delivery to the Buyer at the Closing of certificates

free and clear of any Liens, other than those arising from acts of the Buyer
or its Affiliates and Liens on transfer imposed under applicable securities
Laws or under the certificate of incorporation of the Company. There are no

implied to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party with respect
to the voting of the Shares or any capital stock, equity interests or voting
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

Ranzure in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
any other similar Law affecting creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at Law). Since the execution of the Ranzure License
Agreement, each of the Guarantor and, to the Knowledge of the Guarantor,
Ranzure, has performed the obligations required to be performed by it in
all material respects, as and when required, under the Ranzure License
Agreement. Since the execution of the Ranzure License Agreement, (i) except
for breaches, violations or defaults which have not been, and would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Guarantor, neither the Guarantor, nor to the Guarantors Knowledge
Ranzure, has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act
which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, in any material
respect, would constitute a default under the provisions of the Ranzure
License Agreement, and (ii) the Guarantor has not received written notice that
it has breached, violated or defaulted under the Ranzure License Agreement.
Upon the Ranzure Contribution, all rights and interests of the Guarantor in

event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of the Buyer under any term
or condition of the Financing Commitments. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article 8_ , to the Knowledge of the Buyer, there
exists no fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to (i)
make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the
Financing Commitments inaccurate, (ii) result in any of the terms or
conditions in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied, (iii) cause the
Financing Commitments to be ineffective or (iv) otherwise result in the
Financing Commitments not being available on a timely basis in order to
consummate the Transactions. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Article 8_ , the net proceeds from the Financing Commitments along
with any additional equity financing provided by the Buyer will be sufficient
to consummate the Transactions, including the payment by the Buyer of all
payment obligations hereunder due and owing on the Closing Date. The Buyer has
not incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or liability of any kind,
in each case, which would reasonably be expected to impair or adversely
affect the availability of such proceeds for such uses.

 

Section 6.10 _Solvency_. After giving effect to the Transactions, assuming (a)
the satisfaction of the conditions to Buyers obligations to consummate the
Acquisition set forth in _Article 8_ , (b) the performance in all material
respects by the Seller and the Company of their respective obligations
hereunder, (c) that any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries provided by the Company or the Seller to the Buyer
are based upon reasonable assumptions at the time furnished to the Buyer, and
(d) that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement are true, complete and correct in all material respects, and after
giving effect to the Transactions, each of the Buyer and the Company and the

 



58  Company Subsidiaries (1) will be solvent and (2) will be able to pay its
debts as such debts become due.

 

Section 6.11 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Buyer, threatened against the Buyer or any material portion of its
properties or assets with respect to which there is a substantial possibility
of a determination which questions the validity or legality of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or which seeks to prevent
the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise would reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair the Buyers
ability to effect the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.12 _Buyer s Reliance_. The Buyer acknowledges that none of the
Seller, the Company or any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Shares, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
furnished or made available to the Buyer and its representatives, except
as expressly set forth in _Articles_ 4 and 5 of this Agreement, and neither
of the Seller or any other Person (including any officer, director or
shareholder of the Seller) shall have or be subject to any liability to the
Buyer, or any other Person, resulting from the Buyers use of any
information, documents or material made available to the Buyer in the Data
Site, management presentations, due diligence or in any other form in
expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except as expressly set
forth in _Articles_ 4 and 5. The Buyer acknowledges that, should the Closing
occur, the Buyer shall acquire the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
without any representation or warranty as to merchantability or fitness for
any particular purpose of their respective assets, in an "as is" condition and
on a "where is" basis, except as otherwise expressly represented or warranted
in _Articles_ 4 and 5 of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 6.12 _is intended to limit or modify the
representations and warranties contained in _Articles_ 4 and 5. The Buyer
acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties contained in
_Articles_ 4 and 5, neither the Company, the Seller nor any other Person has
made, and the Buyer has not relied on any other express or implied
representation or warranty by or on behalf of the Company or the Seller. The
Buyer acknowledges that neither the Company, the Seller nor any other Person,
directly or indirectly, has made, and the Buyer has not relied on, any
representation or warranty regarding the pro-forma financial information,
financial projections or other forward-looking statements of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or the Business, and the Buyer will make no claim with
respect thereto.

 

Section 6.13 _Accredited Investor; Investment Intention; Sophistication_. The
Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 promulgated under
the Securities Act. The Buyer will be purchasing the Shares for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the
distribution thereof in violation of applicable securities Laws. The Buyer
has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be
able to evaluate the merits and risks of acquiring the Shares and making an
investment in the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and the Buyer is
a sophisticated entity familiar with transactions similar to those
contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer understands the nature of an

 



59  investment in the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the risks
associated with such an investment.

 

Section 6.14 _Exclusivity of Representations_. The representations and
warranties made by the Buyer in this _Article 6_ and the Ancillary Agreements
are the exclusive representations and warranties made by the Buyer. The Buyer
hereby disclaims any other express or implied representations or warranties.

10_ , the Company and the Guarantor shall give the Buyer and its authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all books,
records, offices and other facilities, personnel and properties of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary as the Buyer, or its authorized
representatives may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such access shall be conducted in a manner not to
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and the Buyer shall not conduct any invasive sampling or
testing with respect to the Leased Real Property. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, (i) neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to disclose any
information to the Buyer or its authorized representatives, if doing so could
violate any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a

Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 21, 2016, by and between
Mitel Networks Corporation and Xura, 

 



63  Inc. (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), unless within an exception
thereto, and shall be held by the Buyer in accordance with and be subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
therein. In the event of the termination of this Agreement for any reason,
the Buyer shall comply with the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, including returning or destroying all Evaluation Material and the

and to the extent set forth therein. Except with respect to Evaluation
Material about the Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Company and its
Subsidiaries), the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate on the Closing
Date.

 

(c) Except for a press release issued pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_, from and
after the Closing Date, the Seller and the Guarantor shall not (and shall,
subject to applicable Law, cause their respective Subsidiaries and
representatives not to) disclose to any Acquiror or Third Party (other than
their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, lenders,
and accountants) any of the terms and conditions of the Transactions or under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements, or any Confidential Information
concerning the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Business, other than any
Confidential Information that is later lawfully acquired by Seller or the
Guarantor from sources other than those related to its prior ownership of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries without any breach of any obligation
(fiduciary, contractual or otherwise) to the Buyer, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Related Persons. The restrictions in
the foregoing sentence shall not apply to a disclosure required by applicable
Law or Governmental Authority or in connection with any legal, regulatory,
judicial, arbitral or administrative process (including any deposition,
interrogatory, oral questioning, requests for information or documents,
subpoena, court order, regulatory filing, civil investigative demand or other
similar legal process) or any audit or inquiry by a regulator, bank examiner
or auditor, self-regulatory authority or pursuant to mandatory professional
ethics rule so long as the disclosing party provides the Buyer with
prior written notice and cooperates with the Buyer, at the Buyers expense,
to obtain a protective Order or other confidential treatment to the extent
requested by the Buyer; _provided_ that such disclosing party shall furnish
only that portion of such information which it is advised by counsel is
legally required to be disclosed. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement
and a description of the Transactions will be filed by the Guarantor with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Canadian securities
regulatory authorities and available to the public. The Buyer shall be given a
reasonable amount of time to review and comment on such filings, which
comments will be reasonably considered by the Guarantor;  _provided_ ,
_however_ that the consent of the Buyer shall not be required in connection
with any such filings.

(d) The initial press releases of the Guarantor and the Buyer with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be issued within 24 hours of the date
hereof in forms reasonably agreed by the Seller and the Buyer. Thereafter, no
party will issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions except
to announce the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will
prohibit any party from issuing or causing publication

 



64  of any such press release or public announcement to the extent that such
disclosure is upon advice of counsel required by Law, in which case the party
making such determination will, if practicable in the circumstances, use
reasonable efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of its issuance; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that nothing herein shall prevent (i) the Guarantor, the Seller,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries from communicating with their
respective employees with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and
(ii) the Buyer and its Affiliates from communicating with their respective
Representatives, suppliers, customers, and Debt Financing Sources regarding
this Agreement and the Transactions.

(e) Each of the parties agrees that it shall, from and after the Closing,
preserve and keep, or cause to be preserved and kept, all books and records in
respect of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in its or its Affiliates
possession for the longer of (i) any applicable statute of limitations and
(ii) a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date. Each of the parties
shall, upon reasonable notice from another party, only to the extent
reasonably necessary in connection with any Proceeding, audit or accounting
matter and subject to any applicable privilege (including attorney-client
privilege), give the other party and its authorized Representatives, in each
case, at the requesting partys sole cost and expense, reasonable access
during normal business hours to examine, inspect and copy the books and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in its or its Affiliates
possession for time periods ending prior to the Closing Date;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such access shall be conducted in a manner not to
interfere with the businesses or operations of any party or its Affiliates.

 

Section 7.3 _Filings and Authorizations; Consummation_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall make, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date of this Agreement (unless
counsel to the parties have previously agreed to extend such fifteen (15)
Business Day period)), an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions. Subject to 
_Section 7.3(d)_, each of the Seller, the Guarantor and the Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be reasonably requested pursuant
to the foregoing, and use reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of (and not to extend) the
applicable waiting periods regarding the foregoing as soon as reasonably
practicable. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it shall pay and shall be
solely responsible for the payment of all filing fees and other charges in
connection with filings required pursuant to Competition Laws.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto, as promptly as practicable, shall make, or
cause to be made, all other filings, consultations, notifications and/or
submissions under Law applicable to it, or to its Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
as may be required for it to consummate the Transactions and, subject to
_Section 7.3(d)_, use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall
not require either party to make any payment or concession to any Person in
connection with obtaining such Persons consent)

 



65  to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all other authorizations, approvals,
consents and waivers from all Persons and Governmental Authorities necessary
to be obtained by it, or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in order for it to
consummate such transactions. The Buyer acknowledges that certain consents and
waivers with respect to the Transactions may be required from parties to
contracts to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party and that
such consents and waivers may not be obtained. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Buyer shall have control over and lead all communications
and strategy relating to obtaining all such consents and waivers, provided
that the Seller shall have the right, (i) prior to any proposed communication
with respect to such consent or waiver, (x) to receive copies of such proposed
communication (if written) or to be informed of such communication (if oral),
and (y) to propose changes to the contents, substance or approach of such
proposed communication, which shall be considered by the Buyer in good faith,
and (ii) to be informed of and have the right to attend and participate in any
meeting, appearance, presentation, argument or any other related in-person
event concerning such consent or waiver.

(c) The parties hereto shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in
exchanging and providing such information to each other and in making the
filings and submissions referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) above (each, a "
_Filing_ ");  _provided_ , that, in connection with any Filing made by a
party, the other party shall have the right, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (i) prior to any proposed Filing, (x) to receive copies of
such proposed Filing, and (y) to propose changes to the contents of any such
proposed Filing, which shall be considered by the filing party in good faith,
and (ii) to be informed of and have the right to attend and participate in any
meeting, appearance, presentation, argument or any other related in-person
event before a Governmental Authority concerning a Filing. The parties hereto
shall supply such reasonable assistance as may be reasonably requested by any
other party hereto in connection with the foregoing. To the extent that any
information or documentation to be provided by either party hereto to the
other pursuant to this _Section 7.3(c)_ is competitively sensitive, such
information may be provided only to external counsel for the Buyer on an
external counsel only basis.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer and
its Affiliates shall have no obligation to, and the Seller, the Guarantor,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall
not, (i) enter into any order, judgment or decree, make any divestiture, pay
any amount, provide any consideration, or divest, license, lease, sell (or
proffer to sell), transfer, dispose of, hold separate (including through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) or otherwise encumber any asset,
license operation, right, product line, business, security, instrument or
interest of the Company, the Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates,
(ii) agree to (or proffer to agree to) any obligation, liability or change, or
impose any limitation or restriction on the Company, the Buyer or any of
their Affiliates to conduct their businesses or own their assets or to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the businesses of the
Company, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, or (iii) take any
other action that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to result in a Burdensome Condition.

 



66 (e) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other parties of any material
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
Transactions. If any party or any Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions, then such party will endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response (which shall
be deemed a Filing) in compliance with such request, subject in each case to
the rights of the parties under _Section 7.3(c)_. In accordance with the
parties rights under _Section 7.3(c)_, the applicable party will advise the
other party promptly in respect of any understandings, undertakings or
agreements (oral or written) (each of which shall be deemed a Filing) which
such party proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions.

 

(f) From the date hereof through the earlier of the Closing or the termination
of this Agreement, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets or enter into a transaction, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger, consolidation or other transaction could reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of any consent, approval,
authorization, declaration, waiver, license, franchise, permit, certificate or
order of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions
or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions or (iii) materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

Section 7.5 _Further Assurances_. From the date hereof until the earlier
of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article 10_ , subject to _Section 7.3(d)_, each of the parties hereto shall

required to carry out the provisions hereof and the actions contemplated
hereby. Each party shall, subject to _Section 7.3(d)_, on or prior to the
Closing Date, use its commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill or obtain the
fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the
Transactions, including the execution and delivery of any documents,
certificates, instruments or other papers that are reasonably required for the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



67 Section 7.6 _Officer and Director Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liability for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (each, a "
_Company Indemnified Party_ ," and collectively, the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ "), as provided in the respective articles of incorporation, by-laws
(or comparable organizational documents), or in indemnification agreements,
shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms for a period of not less than six (6)
years after the Closing Date, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified during such period in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of the Company Indemnified Parties, unless
such modification shall be required by Law.

(b) The covenants contained in this _Section 7.6_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a Company Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. In the event that
the Buyer or the Company or any Company Subsidiary (following the Closing) or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the successors or assigns of the Buyer or the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (following the Closing), as the case may be, to succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_.

Section 7.7 _Termination of Affiliate Obligations_. On or before the
Closing Date, except as set forth on _Schedule 7.7_ , all liabilities and
obligations between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and one or more of its Affiliates (including the Seller and the Guarantor but
not including the Company Subsidiaries) on the other hand, shall be terminated
in full, without any liability for the Company or any Company Subsidiary
thereof following the Closing.

 

Section 7.8 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. Recognizing
that Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP (" _Paul, Weiss_ ") has
acted as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates and may be deemed to have
acted as legal counsel to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing, and that Paul, Weiss intends to act as legal counsel to the
Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing, the Company hereby waives, on its
own behalf and agrees to cause the Company Subsidiaries to waive, any
conflicts that may arise as a result of such previous representation in
connection with Paul, Weiss representing the Seller and its Affiliates after
the Closing.

 



68 Section 7.9 _Seller Guarantees of Assumed Indebtedness._ The parties
hereto acknowledge that on or prior to the Closing, the Seller or its
Affiliates, at their sole cost and expense, shall cause any guarantee by the
Seller or its Affiliates of any Assumed Indebtedness (each a "
_Seller Guarantee_ ") to be released. At Sellers request and sole cost and
expense, the Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Sellers efforts to secure such releases.

 

Section 7.10 _Pre-Closing Insurance_. The parties agree that the Buyer
shall not have the benefit of or access to any insurance policies, including
the self-insurance programs maintained by the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 7.11 _Termination of Services_. The Buyer acknowledges that the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries currently receive or benefit from
certain shared management and administrative and corporate services and
benefits provided by the Seller and its Affiliates, including management,
operations and information technology, customer service, finance, accounting
and payroll and back office services and processing, financial systems,
treasury services (including banking, insurance, administration, taxation and
internal audit), office space, facilities and office management services,
business development and marketing services, product support services,
procurement services, risk management, corporate communications, general
administrative services, executive and management services, legal services,
human resources and personnel services and travel services. Other than as may
be provided pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, the
Buyer further acknowledges that all such services and benefits shall cease,
and any agreement in respect thereof shall terminate as of the Closing Date,
and thereafter, the Sellers and its Affiliates sole obligation with respect
to the provision of any services to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall be as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement.

 

Section 7.12 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility between the Buyer and the Seller for certain Tax
matters following the Closing Date.

(a) _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income, gross or net sales, payments or
receipts, or payroll of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Pre-
Closing Taxable Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity shall be
deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of any other Taxes of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the portion of a Straddle Period that
ends on and includes the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that exemptions, allowances, deductions or Taxes
that are calculated on an annual basis, such as property Taxes and
depreciation deductions, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years
or periods on a daily basis. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company

 



69  or any Company Subsidiary is a "United States shareholder" (within the
meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code) of a controlled foreign corporation
(within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code), amounts, if any, included in
the income of the Company or such Company Subsidiary (as applicable) under
Section 951 of the Code with respect to any Straddle Period of the controlled
foreign corporation shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
periods of the Company or such Company Subsidiary (as applicable) by assuming
that, for purposes of Section 951 of the Code, the Straddle Period of the
controlled foreign corporation consisted of two taxable years or periods, one
of which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of which began
at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date. In the case of any
taxable period that begins before and ends after the Reference Date (a "
_Straddle Reference Date Period_ "), Taxes will be apportioned to the Pre-
Reference Date Taxable Period in the same manner as Taxes are apportioned to
the Pre-Closing Taxable Period in the case of a Straddle Period.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. The Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and the
Seller shall cooperate fully in connection with the preparation and filing of
Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other Proceeding with respect to
Taxes, and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other
documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this  _Section
7.12(b)_. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Buyer or
the Sellers request, as applicable) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. In addition, each party shall promptly notify the other
party in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an
audit received by such party from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person with respect to Taxes for which such other party may be liable. Any
information obtained under this  _Section 7.12(b)_ (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any information provided pursuant to the following
sentence) shall be kept confidential, except as may be necessary in connection
with the filing of a Tax Return or a Tax proceeding. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall permit or be deemed to permit
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or representatives to review or otherwise
have access to a Tax Return of any Affiliated Group that includes the Seller
or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that a tax adviser to the
Buyer shall have access to, and shall have the right to review, any such Tax
Return to the extent such Tax Return relates, or is with respect, to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and, in such tax advisers judgment, such
review is necessary for the determination of any Tax of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, but only in the event such tax adviser confirms that
the information on such Tax Return will be maintained in confidence except to
the extent required to be disclosed in connection with any Tax contest
involving the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

 

(c) _Tax Contests_.

(i) The Seller shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing
at its own expense, of any audit, claim for refund, or other administrative or
judicial Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of the 

 



70  Company Subsidiaries (any such audit, claim for refund, or Proceeding
referred to herein as a " _Contest_ ") relating solely to taxable periods
ending on or before the Reference Date, and all Contests with respect to any
Tax Return of any Affiliated Group that includes the Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than solely the Company or any Company Subsidiary) (a "
_Pre-Closing Consolidated Return_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
Seller shall have no right to represent the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in any such Contest unless the Seller shall have first notified the Buyer in
writing (1) that it will represent the Company and/or any Company Subsidiary
in any such Contest and (2) of the identity of counsel chosen by the Seller in
connection therewith; (B) the Seller will keep the Buyer reasonably informed
concerning the progress, developments and events of such Contest; (C) the
Seller will provide to the Buyer copies of all correspondence and other
documents relevant to such Contest to the extent related to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; and (D) the Seller will not settle, compromise and/or
concede (or permit or cause any Person to settle, compromise and/or concede)
any portion of such Contest that is reasonably likely to affect (1) the Tax
liability or (2) any Tax attribute, including but not limited to any net
operating loss, net operating loss carryforward or tax credit, in each case,
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the Reference Date without the
prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Buyer will have the right to
participate in the defense of any such Contest (which will include
participation in meetings with taxing authorities and reviewing and commenting
on written submissions to taxing authorities) and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Seller; provided that
in the case of a Contest that relates to a Pre-Closing Consolidated Return,
the Buyer shall only have the right to participate in the portion of such
Contest, if any, that relates to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. With
respect to any such Contest other than a Contest that relates to a Pre-Closing
Consolidated Return (x) involving Tax matters or items that could reasonably
be expected to form the basis for a claim of indemnification against the
Seller pursuant to _Section 7.12(j)_, and (y) that the Seller does not or
cannot elect to control pursuant to this _Section 7.12(c)(i)_, the Buyer
will control such Contest, including the defense and settlement thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer will: (1) keep the Seller reasonably
informed concerning the progress, developments and events of such Contest, (2)
provide to the Seller copies of all correspondence and other documents
relevant to such Contest, and (3) not settle, compromise and/or concede any
such Contest without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and the Seller
will have the right to participate in the defense of any such Contest (which
will include participation in meetings with taxing authorities and reviewing
and commenting on written submissions to taxing authorities) and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Buyer.

(ii) In the case of a Contest not described in _Section 7.12(c)(i)_ that
relates to a Straddle Reference Date Period, the Buyer shall control the
conduct of such Contest, but the Seller shall have the right to participate in
such Contest at its own expense. Neither the Buyer nor the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries shall settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest,
to the extent it relates to any Pre-Reference Date Taxable Period, without the
prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Buyer

 



71  fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Contest within a
reasonable period following the receipt by the Buyer of notice of such
Contest, the Seller shall have the right to assume control of such Contest;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller will: (1) keep the Buyer reasonably
informed concerning the progress, developments and events of such Contest, (2)
provide to the Buyer copies of all correspondence and other documents
relevant to such Contest, and (3) not settle, compromise and/or concede such
Contest without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) _Close of Tax Year_. The parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted or
required under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the
taxable period of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all Tax
purposes.

(e) _Seller-Filed Tax Returns_. The Seller shall prepare or cause to be
prepared all income or franchise Tax Returns of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with respect to tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, including all Straddle Periods (but, in the case of Tax Returns for
Straddle Periods, only with respect to Tax Returns of any Affiliated Group
that includes the Seller or any of its Affiliates other than solely the
Company or any Company Subsidiary)) and all Tax Returns of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or before the Closing
Date (together, " _Seller Returns_ "), and the Seller shall remit or cause to
be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Seller Returns. All such Seller
Returns shall be timely prepared in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. The Seller shall submit each of the Seller Returns
(but only to the extent related to the Company or any Company Subsidiary)
that is required to be filed after the Closing Date to the Buyer at least
thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required to be
filed (or, if such due date is within thirty (30) days following the Closing
Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date) (including
extensions) in the case of income Tax Returns and, in the case of any other
Tax Returns, within a reasonable period of time prior to the due date
(including extensions), and the Buyer shall have the right to review and
comment on the Seller Returns. If the Buyer disputes any item on any such Tax
Return, it shall notify the Seller of such disputed item (or items) and the
basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any
such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to
be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in
question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Seller and the Buyer. The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Buyer. The Buyer
shall reimburse the Seller for any Taxes with respect to any Straddle
Reference Date Period for which the Seller is not responsible pursuant to
_Section 7.12(j)_ shown as due on such Seller Returns as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 7.12(e)_ upon written request setting forth in
reasonable detail the computation of the amount owed by the Buyer. Each such
reimbursement shall be made no more than the later of ten (10) days after the
date upon which such request was made (or, if later, the date on which any
dispute is resolved in accordance with this _Section 7.12(e)_) or three (3)
days before the due date of the relevant Seller Return.

 



72 (f) _Other Tax Returns_. Except for the Seller Returns, the Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries the due date of which (taking
into account valid extensions of time to file) is after the Closing Date ("
_Buyer Returns_ "). All such Buyer Returns relating to a Straddle Reference
Date Period shall be prepared timely in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries unless otherwise required
by applicable Law. The Buyer shall submit each of the Buyer Returns relating
to a Straddle Reference Date Period to the Seller at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed (or, if
such due date is within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, as
promptly as practicable following the Closing Date) (including extensions) in
the case of income Tax Returns and, in the case of any other Tax Returns,
within a reasonable period of time prior to the due date
(including extensions), and the Seller shall have the right to review and
comment on such Buyer Returns. If the Seller disputes any item on any such Tax
Return, it shall notify the Buyer of such disputed item (or items) and the
basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any
such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to
be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in
question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Buyer and the Seller. The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller. The Seller
shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for any Taxes with respect to any Pre-
Closing Taxable Period for which the Seller is responsible pursuant to
_Section 7.12(j) _shown as due on such Buyer Returns, as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 7.12(f)_, upon written request setting forth
in reasonable detail the computation of the amount owed by the Seller. Each
such reimbursement shall be made no more than the later of ten (10) days after
the date upon which such request was made (or, if later, the date on which any
dispute is resolved in accordance with this _Section 7.12(f)_) or three (3)
days before the due date of the relevant Buyer Return. For the avoidance of
doubt, the limitations on the liability of the Seller set forth in _Article
11_ shall not apply to the reimbursement obligations under this _Section
7.12(f)_.

(g) _No Amended Tax Returns_. Except as required by Law, none of the Seller,
the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary) shall amend, refile or otherwise modify
any Tax Return relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect
to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period, nor any Straddle Period, without the other
partys written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ , that the Seller and its Affiliates may amend, refile
or otherwise modify any such income or franchise Tax Return that is a
consolidated, affiliated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Return, provided,
however, that none of the Seller or any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile
or otherwise modify any such income or franchise Tax Return to the extent
that such amendment, refiling or other modification, taken together with all
other amendments, refilings and other modifications of any such Tax Returns,
will reduce any federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary existing on the Closing Date (without taking
into account the impact of the Transactions, including the Internal
Reorganization) by more than $25.0 million after the Closing Date, without
the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent will not be

 



73  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, none of the Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall utilize in its consolidated federal income Tax Return any of the net
operating loss carryforwards of Mavenir Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
the time Seller acquired Mavenir Systems, Inc., other than in connection with
the Transactions (including the Internal Reorganization) or in the ordinary
course of business.

(h) _Information to be Provided by the Buyer_. With respect to any taxable
year of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for which the Seller is
required to file a Tax Return pursuant to _Section 7.12(e)_, the Buyer shall
promptly cause the Company to prepare and provide to the Seller a package of
tax information materials (the " _Tax Package_ "), which shall be completed
in accordance with the past practice of the Company or the relevant Company
Subsidiary including past practice as to providing the information, schedules
and work papers and as to the method of computation of separate taxable
income or other relevant measure of income. The Buyer shall cause the Tax
Package for the portion of the taxable period ending on the Closing Date to be
delivered to the Seller within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
Closing Date.

(i) _Limitation on Actions; Certain Elections_.

 

(i) Without the prior written consent of the Seller, the Buyer will not, and
will not permit any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to, make or initiate any voluntary
contact with any Governmental Authority with respect to any Pre-Reference Date
Taxable Period or any Straddle Reference Date Period, including pursuant to
any voluntary disclosure agreement, or make any other voluntary contact with
any Governmental Authority, in each case if such action could reasonably be
expected to increase the Tax liability of the Seller or any of its Affiliates
or to result in an indemnification obligation under _Section 7.12(j)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , (A) to the extent that the Seller refuses to provide
such written consent, any mitigation obligation of the Buyer or any other
Indemnified Party described in _Section 11.2 _with respect to the matters
for which the Seller has not provided such written consent will be deemed to
be satisfied and none of the Seller or any of its Affiliates will take any
inconsistent position that they have so failed to mitigate in any Proceeding
and (B) such limitations described in this _Section 7.12(i)(i)_ shall not
apply to any voluntary disclosure agreement or any other voluntary contact by
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates with any Governmental Authority with
respect to any Tax year or Tax period beginning after the Reference Date if
the Buyer Indemnitees shall have waived in writing their right to any
indemnification obligation hereunder with respect to the specific Tax which
is the subject of such voluntary disclosure or other voluntary contact.

(ii) The Seller agrees that it will not make any election pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reattribute any portion of the
attributes of the Company referred to in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B). The Seller agrees to make a proper election pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-95(c) to apportion all of any Code
Section 382 limitations that apply to the loss subgroup consisting of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, 

 



74  and each element thereof (the value element, the adjustment element and the
net unrealized built-in gain), to the Companys loss subgroup (as such terms
are used in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-95(c)). The Buyer shall
provide to the Seller drafts of the form or forms of such election and the
agreement required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-95(f)(1)(ii) at
least thirty (30) days prior to the time such election is filed. The Seller
and the Buyer shall cooperate to resolve any suggested changes to such draft
that are submitted by the Seller, which shall be provided to the Buyer within
fifteen (15) days after the Seller receives such drafts. 

(j) _Seller Indemnification_. Except to the extent taken into account in the
calculation of Final Working Capital, from and after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall hold harmless and indemnify each of the Buyer Indemnitees from
and against any Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnitees
arising out of, involving, relating to, connected with, or otherwise
in respect of: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Specified
Representation; (ii) without duplication, Taxes imposed on the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary may
otherwise be liable, for any Pre-Closing Taxable Period; and (iii) the items
of Tax disclosed on _Schedule 7.12(j)_ ; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (w) the Seller shall not have any
indemnification obligation pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) of this
_Section 7.12(j)_ in respect of Losses described in such clauses to the
extent such Losses are in respect of Taxes described in clause (iii) of this
_Section 7.12(j)_ , (x) the Seller shall not have any indemnification
obligation in respect of Losses arising under clause (i) of this _Section
7.12(j)_, to the extent such Losses are recoverable under the Representations
and Warranties Insurance Policy or any amended or replacement policy with
such Losses deemed as if such Losses are the last Losses submitted and
resolved under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy or any
amended or replacement policy, (y) the Seller shall not have any
indemnification obligation in respect of Losses for Taxes described in clause
(ii) of this _Section 7.12(j)_ to the extent such Losses also arise under
clause (i) of this _Section 7.12(j)_ (even if such Losses are recoverable
under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy or any amended or
replacement policy) and (z) the Seller shall not have any indemnification
obligation in respect of Losses attributable to Taxes relating to any taxable
period (or portion thereof) after the Reference Date, other than in respect of
Taxes of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) for any Pre-Closing Taxable Period (the " _Post-Reference
Date Taxes_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers obligations under any
of clause (i), clause (ii) or clause (iii) of this _Section 7.12(j)_ shall not
be reduced by the Deductible or by the application of a retention amount
pursuant to the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the
Sellers aggregate liability under this _Section 7.12(j)_ exceed the amount
equal to (i) $350 million _minus_ (ii) all amounts paid or payable by the
Seller or the Guarantor under _Article 11_. The parties agree that for
purposes of this _Section 7.12(j)_, Losses (or any portion thereof) that are
not explicitly excluded from coverage under the Representations and Warranties
Insurance Policy or any amended or replacement policy are recoverable until
the Buyer Indemnitees shall have expended commercially reasonable efforts to
recover such Losses under the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy
or any amended or replacement policy, and it has been finally

 



75  determined that the claim in respect of such Losses (or any portion thereof)
has been denied.

 

(k) Any Tax Sharing Agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other hand, shall be terminated
as to the Company or such Company Subsidiary on or prior to the Reference
Date, and after the Reference Date none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall have any liability thereunder. Any power of attorney with
respect to Taxes relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary granted by
any of the Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be terminated
on or prior to the Closing.

 

(l) _Consideration_. The parties hereto agree to treat the payments of the
Mitel Units and Investments Note as taxable consideration, the value of each
of which shall be as reasonably agreed in writing by the Buyer and the Seller
on or before the Closing Date, received by the Seller in connection with the
Acquisition, and to take no Tax position inconsistent with such
treatment, except as otherwise required by a change in applicable Law or a
good faith resolution of a Contest.

(m) The Seller will be entitled to any refunds (or credits in lieu of
refunds) (including interest received thereon) of Taxes of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in respect of any Pre-Reference Date Taxable Period or the
portion of any Straddle Reference Date Period ending on or before the
Reference Date, except to the extent such amounts are included as assets in
Final Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , the Seller shall not be
entitled to any refund of, or credit with respect to, Taxes of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that results from the carryback of losses, credits or
similar items by the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller (except, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to refunds or credits resulting from a Tax
Return of any Affiliated Group that includes the Seller or any of its
Affiliates). The Buyer shall cause such refund or the amount of such credit to
be paid to the Seller promptly after it is received, allowed or applied
against any Tax liability.

 

(n) _Buyer Indemnification_. The Buyer shall hold harmless and indemnify each
of the Seller Indemnitees from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by
any of the Seller Indemnitees arising out of, involving, relating to,
connected with or otherwise in respect of the Post-Reference Date Taxes. The
parties agree that the utilization of any net operating loss
carryforward shall not be considered a Loss for purposes of this _Section
7.12(n)_.

(o) The parties agree that the principal amount of the Investments Note shall
be automatically increased, without any action required by any Person, by the
aggregate amount of any indemnification payments made by or on behalf of the
Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to clause (iii) of  _Section 7.12(j)_.

Section 7.13 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer
at the Closing a certificate or certificates, in compliance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2, certifying that the transactions contemplated
hereby are exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

 



76 Section 7.14 _Audit of Financial Statements_. If the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates retain an independent accounting firm to audit all or part of the
Financial Statements (an " _Audit_ "), at the Buyers request the Seller and
the Guarantor shall, and shall, subject to applicable Law, cause their
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with the Buyer and its authorized
representatives in connection with the preparation of an Audit including by
providing Buyer with reasonable access to the books and records of the Seller,
the Guarantor, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with
the Audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Seller or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to disclose any
information to the Buyer, or its authorized representatives, if doing so could
violate any Contract to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party
or to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is subject, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
seek waivers to provide such information and shall provide redacted copies of
such information to the extent permissible if waivers cannot be obtained. The
Buyer shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses arising from or
related to an Audit, and the Buyer shall promptly reimburse the Seller,
the Guarantor and their Affiliates for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by them at the Buyers request in connection with an Audit.
Any information about the Seller, the Guarantor and their Affiliates
(excluding, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) provided to
or obtained by the Buyer or its authorized representatives pursuant to this
_Section 7.14_ shall be Evaluation Material (subject to the exclusions set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement) and shall be held by the Buyer in
accordance with and be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
The parties agree that neither the Seller nor its Affiliates shall have any
liability whatsoever for any adjustment to the Financial Statements after the
date hereof arising out of or related to an Audit or for any Losses arising
out of or related to an Audit unless such liability or Loss is for a breach of
a representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement;  _provided_ that
nothing in this sentence is intended to limit or modify the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or any Buyer Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification under this Agreement.

 

Section 7.15 _Name and Logo Change_.

 

(a) The Buyer hereby agrees to (i) change the legal names and logos of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to names and logos that do not contain,
are not derived from, and are not confusingly similar to "Mitel" or any other
trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand names, logos, trade dress,
design rights or other similar designations of source,
sponsorship, association or origin owned by Seller (the " _Seller Marks_ ")
and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to remove any reference to, including
from any signs, products, equipment, literature and business materials
(including schedules, inventories, periodic statements, packaging materials
and similar forms), any of the Seller Marks, in each case, as promptly as
possible but in any event no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days
following the Closing Date and to otherwise cease any use of the Seller Marks
from and after the Closing.

 



77 (b) The Seller and Guarantor hereby agree, on behalf of themselves and their
Subsidiaries, to (i) change the legal names and logos of the Seller, the
Guarantor and each of their applicable Subsidiaries to names and logos that do
not contain, are not derived from, and are not confusingly similar to the
Mavenir Trademarks or any other trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand
names, logos, trade dress, design rights or other similar designations of
source, sponsorship, association or origin owned by Buyer after the Closing
(the " _Buyer Marks_ ") and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to remove any
reference to, including from any signs, products, equipment, literature and
business materials (including schedules, inventories, periodic statements,
packaging materials and similar forms), any of the Buyer Marks, in each case,
as promptly as possible but in any event no later than one hundred and twenty
(120) days following the Closing Date and to otherwise cease any use of the
Buyer Marks from and after the Closing.

 

(c) Except as provided in _Section 7.15(a)_ and _(b)_ , the parties agree
that neither party has a license to use any of the trademarks, service marks,
trade names, brand names, logos, trade dress, design rights or other similar
designations of source, sponsorship, association or origin owned by the other
party, and each party retains full rights to enforce its rights in the
foregoing.

Section 7.16 _Internal Reorganization_. At the request of the Buyer, the
Seller and the Company shall initiate the internal reorganization
transactions set forth in _Schedule 7.16_ (the " _Internal Reorganization_ ")
in accordance therewith and take reasonable steps to allow the Internal
Reorganization to be consummated immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , the Seller and the Company shall not be required to effect the
Internal Reorganization unless the Buyer shall have waived or confirmed in
writing the satisfaction of all conditions set forth in _Article 8_ and shall
have confirmed in writing that the Buyer is prepared to immediately proceed,
following completion of the Internal Reorganization, to consummate the
Closing. Subject to the proviso in the preceding sentence, the Seller and the
Company agree to reasonably cooperate with the Buyer with respect to
effectuating the Internal Reorganization immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The
Buyer agrees to waive for all purposes of this Agreement (including _Article
8_ and _Article 11_ ) any breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant contained herein by the Seller, the Guarantor or the Company where
such breach is a result of an action taken by the Seller, the Guarantor or the
Company to effect the Internal Reorganization. In furtherance of but without
limiting the foregoing, the Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither
the Seller nor any of its Affiliates has undertaken any analysis or provided
any disclosure with respect to whether the transactions contemplated by the
Internal Reorganization constitute a breach or any representation, warranty
or covenant contained herein. The Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with and assist the Seller and the Company in initiating
and consummating the Internal Reorganization and agrees to promptly reimburse
the Seller upon request by the Seller on an after-Tax basis for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with such cooperation, including considering
and implementing

 



78  the Internal Reorganization. The Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the

Reorganization. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

under _Article 11_ with respect to a Loss arising from, or in connection with,
the Internal Reorganization, (ii) the obligation of the Buyer to reimburse and
indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 7.16_ will
be in addition to any other payment Buyer may be obligated to make hereunder
and will survive the termination of this Agreement, and (iii) the Buyer shall
not be required to indemnify the Seller or any of its Affiliates for Losses
(including Taxes) incurred, suffered or paid by any of the Seller or its
Affiliates arising out of or resulting from the Internal Reorganization to the
extent such Losses arise out of or result from the willful misconduct or
intentional fraud by the Guarantor, the Seller, or any of their respective
Related Persons or Representatives. The Buyer affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement that the Internal Reorganization is completed.

Section 7.17 _Agreement Not To Compete_. 

(a) The Seller and the Guarantor understand that the Buyer shall be entitled
to protect and preserve the going concern value of the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by Law and that
the Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of
this _Section 7.17_ and, therefore, for a period of three (3) years from the
Closing, the Seller and the Guarantor shall not, and shall cause each of their
controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly:

anywhere in the world that are substantially in competition with the Business

Subsidiary, or (B) solicit or encourage any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to leave the employment of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

7.17_ shall not apply to any Person (an " _Acquiror_ ") that directly or
indirectly acquires control or

 



79  succeeds to the obligations of the Seller or the Guarantor or any Person
that controls the Seller or the Guarantor after the date hereof by way of an
amalgamation, arrangement, merger, consolidation, share acquisition, asset

aggregate of five percent (5%) of any class of stock of a Person engaged,
directly or indirectly, in Competitive Activities; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such stock is listed on a national securities exchange.

7.17(a)(ii)_ shall not in any way restrict or otherwise prohibit the Seller,
the Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any of the

employee initiates discussions regarding employment on his or her own
initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by the Seller, the
Guarantor or their respective Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, it is understood and agreed
that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to _Article 11_ and other
remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the covenants
contained in _Section 7.17(a)_. The Buyer shall be entitled to equitable
relief, including the remedy of specific performance, with respect to any
breach or attempted breach of such covenants, without the requirement to prove
actual damages or to post a bond or other security.

 

Section 7.18 _Agreement Not To Solicit_. The Seller, the Guarantor and the
Company and their respective Representatives shall effective upon the

Section 11.4 _Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In connection with a claim made by any Person not a
party hereto (other than Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified
Parties) against a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") pursuant to which an Indemnified Party may be entitled
to any indemnification provided for under  _Section 11.1_ (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall notify the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of such Third Party Claim (setting forth in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such Third Party Claim (to the
extent known by the Indemnified Party) and the amount or estimated amount (to
the extent reasonably estimable) of Losses arising out of, involving or
otherwise in respect of such Third Party Claim) within twenty (20) Business
Days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

(b)  _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the 

 



96 Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense thereof if (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable
assurance to the Indemnified Party of its willingness to defend such Third
Party Claim, (ii) the Third Party Claim is a criminal Proceeding, or relates
to such a Proceeding, or (iii) such Third Party Claim may be covered by the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy or any amended or replacement
policy even if the Losses are not expected to exceed the retention under such
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section
11.4(b)_, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof, provided that the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ one (1) counsel to represent such Indemnified Party
(plus one (1) local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction) if the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are both named parties to the
Proceedings and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith and upon advice
of outside legal counsel that joint representation would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them, and in that event the
reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel for the Indemnified
Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Any such participation or
assumption shall not constitute a waiver by any party of any attorney-client
privilege in connection with such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section
11.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party and all of the Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 11.4(b)_ and the
Indemnifying Party does not, within twenty (20) Business Days after such
notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section
11.4(b)_, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any determination made in
such Third Party Claim or any settlement, compromise or discharge effected by
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle such Third Party
Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party unless such settlement (i)
does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law or any
violation of the rights of any Person, (ii) does not involve any relief other
than monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (iii)
does not require the consent of the insurance policy provider pursuant to the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy and (iv) completely, finally
and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party in connection with such
Third Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, cause, or agree to, the waiver of the attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product immunity or any other privilege or protection
in respect of confidential legal memoranda and other privileged materials
drafted by, or otherwise reflecting the

 



97 legal advice of, internal or outside counsel of an Indemnified Party (the "
_Subject Materials_ ") relating to such Third Party Claim. Each party hereto
mutually acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that
(i) each shares a common legal interest in preparing for the defense of legal
proceedings, or potential legal proceedings, arising out of, relating to or
in respect of any actual or threatened Third Party Claim or any related claim
or counterclaim, (ii) the sharing of Subject Materials will further such
common legal interest and (iii) by disclosing any Subject Materials to and/or
sharing any Subject Materials with the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall not waive the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
immunity or any other privilege or protection; provided, however, nothing
herein shall prohibit an Indemnifying Party that does not choose to defend a
Third Party Claim from utilizing Subject Materials to defend itself against a
claim by the party seeking indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified
Party shall not be required to make available to the Indemnifying Party any
information that is subject to an attorney-client or other applicable legal
privilege that based on the advice of outside counsel would be impaired by
such disclosure or any confidentiality restriction under applicable Law.

(d) _Other Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim against
any Indemnifying Party under _Section 11.1_ that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party (setting forth in reasonable detail the facts giving rise
to such claim (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) and the amount
or estimated amount (to the extent reasonably estimable) of Losses arising out
of, involving or otherwise in respect of such claim); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under _Section 11.1_, such claim specified
by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of
any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof)
is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such
portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

(e) _Interest_. Any amounts due hereunder that are not paid on or before the
second (2nd) Business Day after such amounts have been finally determined to
be due hereunder shall bear interest at a rate equal to the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition on the Closing Date.

(f) _Coordination with Tax Contests_. If there shall be any conflicts between
the provisions of this _Section 11.4_ and _Section 7.12_, the provisions of
_Section 7.12_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

 

Section 11.5 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Following the Closing, any
payment made pursuant to this _Article 11_ or  _Section 7.12(j)_ shall be
treated by the parties hereto, for Tax purposes, as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

 



98 Section 11.6 _Set-off; Payment_. Any payment in excess of the RandW Cap to be
made by the Seller or the Guarantor pursuant to this _Article 11_ or _Section
7.12(j)_ shall be first paid by a dollar for dollar set-off against the Buyer
Note unless and until the principal amount owed by Investments thereunder is
equal to zero (taking into account the following sentence), second in cash
unless and until the aggregate cash payments made by Seller or the Guarantor
pursuant to this _Article 11_ or _Section 7.12(j)_ equal $385 million and
third by a forfeiture of Mitel Units with the number of Mitel Units forfeited
to be determined based upon the value of the Mitel Units as established
pursuant to _Section 7.12(l)_. Set-off against the Buyer Note shall be the
exclusive remedy for any Losses for which an Indemnified Party is indemnified
under _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_ (but only to the extent the Indemnified Party is
seeking indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_ and not any other
clause of  _Section 11.1(a)_), and any such set-off shall be deemed to be
the first claim for set-off against the Buyer Note.

 

Section 11.7 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this
_Article 11_) in connection with any claim or demand by any Person other than
the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates, such Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party
as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party
may have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim or demand (except
with respect to the insurer(s) under the Representations and
Warranties Insurance Policy to the extent such insurer(s) have acknowledged
coverage) against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand.
Such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a
reasonable manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting
any subrogated right, defense or claim.

Section 11.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, except in the case of intentional fraud, in connection with a dispute
under _Section 2.3_ (which shall be governed exclusively by _Section
2.3(b)_), or as provided in  _Section 7.12(j)_, or as provided for in
_Section 7.17_, the indemnification provisions of _Article 11_ and the
Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy (or any amended or replacement
policy) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties following the
Closing for any and all breaches or alleged breaches of any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, or any other provision of
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that all Losses
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, other than those for which a
Buyer Indemnitee recovers Losses in accordance with

 

 _Article 11_ , _Section 7.12(j)_ or the Representations and Warranties
Insurance Policy, shall be the sole responsibility of the Buyer, and after
the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. In furtherance (and not
in limitation) of the foregoing, the Buyer irrevocably covenants to refrain,
and to cause its Affiliates to refrain, from directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or
causing to be commenced, any Proceeding of any kind against any Related Person
of the Seller or the Guarantor (other than the Seller and the Guarantor),
based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, the Transactions or the organization, management and operation of
the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary on or prior to the
Closing Date.

 



99 ARTICLE 12

 

 _GUARANTY_

 

Section 12.1 _Guaranty by Guarantor_. Guarantor hereby absolutely and
unconditionally guarantees to the Buyer the prompt payment or performance
when due, of all of the Sellers agreements, undertakings and other
obligations under this Agreement (collectively, " _Obligations_ "), to the
same extent as the Seller has such liability (collectively the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ "). If all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be
punctually paid or performed by the Seller as and when the same become due in
accordance with this Agreement, the Buyer shall provide notice to the
Guarantor of such failure, with such notice providing reasonable details
regarding the Guaranteed Obligations unfulfilled by the Seller and for which
payment or performance is being sought from the Guarantor hereunder.
Such demand(s) may be made after the time for payment or performance of all
or part of the Guaranteed Obligations is due, but not punctually paid or
performed by the Seller, and may be made from time to time with respect to the
same or different items of Guaranteed Obligations. All payments made
hereunder shall be made without reduction, whether by offset, payment in
escrow, or otherwise, except in all cases to the extent of any and all
defenses to payment or performance or offset rights which may be available to
the Seller.

Section 12.2 _Guaranty of Payment, Performance and Collection_.
This guaranty is a guaranty of payment, performance, and collection. The
Guarantor waives any right to require the Buyer to sue the Seller concurrently
with, or as a condition precedent to, any suit or action against the
Guarantor.

 

Section 12.3 _Consideration and Information_. The Guarantor is the owner
of 100% of the equity of the Seller, and will derive substantial economic
benefit from the Transactions, and the Buyers willingness to enter into this
Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, is based, in part, on the
Guarantors agreements under this  _Article 12_. The Guarantor assumes all
responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Sellers financial
condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of
nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of
the risks that the Guarantor assumes and incurs under this _Article 12_ , and
agrees that the Buyer shall not have any duty to advise the Guarantor of
information known to the Buyer regarding those circumstances or risks.

Section 12.4 _Guarantor Successors and Assigns_. If the Guarantor or any
of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger, and any Guaranteed Obligations
remain outstanding, the successors and assigns of the Guarantor shall
immediately assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the Guarantor set
forth in this _Article 12_, mutatis mutandis as if set forth in this _Article
12_ as of the date hereof, without any further action by, or consent required
from, the parties or any other Person. The Guarantor shall take, and shall
cause its Affiliates to take, all actions necessary or beneficial to give
effect to this _Section 12.4_.

response to every representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement in
respect of which such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face.
The inclusion of any matter, information or item in any Schedule to this

(b) The Schedules and Exhibits hereto are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in this

as a waiver of any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or condition,
or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement.

Section 13.8 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted
successors and assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by
operation of law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights, obligations
or liabilities under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other parties to this Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its
absolute discretion; _provided_ , that, without the prior written consent of
any Person, Buyer may (i) assign and/or transfer any of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Buyer, it being acknowledged and
agreed that any such assignment will not relieve Buyer from its obligations
under this Agreement, and/or (ii) assign its rights, but not its obligations,
hereunder to any of its or its Affiliates respective Debt Financing Sources.
Any purported assignment without such prior written consents shall be void.

 

Section 13.9 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
confer any rights, remedies or claims upon any Person or entity not a party

current and former officers, directors and employees of the Company as set

(c) Buyer and its Related Persons with respect to _Section 10.3_, and (d) the
Debt Financing Sources with respect to the Debt Financing Source Provisions.

 

Section 13.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number
of counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart
were upon a single instrument, each of which when delivered to the other
parties (including via facsimile or e-mail portable document format (*.pdf))
will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which,
when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement.

 

Section 13.11 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and any
Proceeding hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of
conflict of Laws thereof to the extent such principles would require or permit
the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

  



103 Section 13.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
may only be instituted in any state or federal court in the State of Delaware,

and the Seller and the Buyer agree to jointly file all required change of

Seller related to the foregoing shall be promptly reimbursed by the Buyer.

 

Section 13.14 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 13.14(b)_, the parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, except as set forth
in _Section 13.14(b)_, each party hereto shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
breaches of the provisions hereof and to enforce the specific performance of
the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Except as
set forth in _Section 13.14(b)_, each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any party seeking (i) an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such order or injunction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Seller, the Guarantor and the Company shall be entitled to
obtain specific performance of the Buyers and Investments obligations to
consummate the Transactions if and only in the event that each of
the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set
forth in _Article 8_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing),
(ii) the Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (iii) the Debt Financing
Sources will make available to the Buyer the full amount of the Debt Financing
pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive debt
agreements, as applicable, if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing
and (iv) the Seller, the Guarantor and the Company have irrevocably confirmed
in a written notice delivered to the Buyer that if specific performance is
granted, then the conditions set forth in _Article 9_

 



104  that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing will be
satisfied promptly and the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, (1)
in no event shall the Company, the Guarantor or the Seller be entitled to
force the Buyer in any manner to consummate the Closing if the Debt Financing
has not been funded or will not be funded at the Closing and (2) in no event
shall the Seller, the Guarantor or the Company be entitled to both specific
performance to consummate the Closing and payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee.

 

Section 13.15 _Severability_. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
reasonably acceptable manner so that the Transactions may be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 13.16 _Lender Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) agrees
that it will not bring or support any person in any action, suit, proceeding,
cause of action, claim, cross claim or third party claim of any kind or
description, whether at Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including, but not limited to, any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any
forum other than the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough
of Manhattan within the City of New York, (ii) agrees that, except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of
action (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or
rules or conflict of Laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction, and (iii)
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to
a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in Law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the Seller, the Guarantor, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and its and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or
stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing
Source, in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of
the Transactions, or in respect of any other document or any of the
Transactions, or in respect of any oral or written representations made or
alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any

 



105  way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise and (b) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any of the Seller, the
Guarantor, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and its and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members, representatives or stockholders for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions or in respect
of any oral or written representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at Law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Debt Financing Sources are intended third
party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the protections of
this provision.
