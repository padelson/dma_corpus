 _THE OFFER_

Section 2.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to
_Article IX_ , Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
commence (within the

 



10  meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within a reasonable
period of time following the date of this Agreement, and in any event within
ten (10) Business Days following the execution of this Agreement by the
parties (or such other date as the parties may agree in writing).

(b) The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to:
(i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn prior
to any then scheduled Expiration Time that number of shares of Company Common
Stock which, together with the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by Parent or Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of the
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended and re-extended in accordance
with this _Section 2.1_) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); (ii) the Company
Board having granted each of Parent and Merger Sub an effective exemption from
the restrictions on transfer and ownership of the Companys stock contained in
Article VII of the Company Charter (the " _Ownership Limit Waivers_ "); and
(iii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Exhibit A_ , as such conditions may
be modified in accordance with this Agreement (together with the Minimum
Condition and the Ownership Limit Waivers, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). For
purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied, any
shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures shall
be included only if such shares have been delivered pursuant to such
procedures. Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other Offer Conditions
as of the Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for
payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after
the Expiration Time. The Offer Price payable in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer shall be paid to the seller in cash, without interest (subject to
any withholding of Tax pursuant to _Section 4.3_), on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set
forth in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub
expressly reserve the right (in their sole discretion) to waive, in whole or
in part, any Offer Condition, to increase the Offer Price or to make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously
approved in writing by the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall (i)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)
reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ or modify or change any Offer Condition in
any manner materially adverse to any stockholders of the Company, (v) except
as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.1_, extend or otherwise change the
expiration date of the Offer, or (vi) otherwise amend, modify or supplement
any of the other terms of the Offer in any manner materially adverse to any
stockholder of the Company.

 



11 (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offer shall
expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20)
Business Days following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") or,
in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this
Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the
Initial Expiration Time, or such later date and time to which the Initial
Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this Agreement, is referred to
as the " _Expiration Time_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) extend the Offer on one or more
occasions, in consecutive increments of up to fifteen (15) Business Days (or
such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) each, if on any then-
scheduled Expiration Time any of the Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied
or waived if in the reasonable discretion of Parent such condition or
conditions are capable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date,
until such time as such condition or conditions are satisfied or waived, and
(ii) extend the Offer for the minimum period required by applicable Law or any
interpretation or position of the SEC applicable to the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event (A) shall Merger Sub be required to extend the
Offer beyond September 17, 2014 (the " _Outside Date_ ") or (B) shall this 
_Section 2.1(e)_ be construed or deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its
sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, make available one (1) or more
"subsequent offering periods" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents may, in Merger Subs sole discretion,
provide for such a reservation of right.

(f) On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of
the Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay the Offer Price (subject to any
withholding of Tax pursuant to _Section 4.3_) pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_
for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the Expiration
Time (as it may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this _Section
2.1_). Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a
timely basis, the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the
Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Subs obligations
under this Agreement. Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to and subject to the Offer Conditions upon the Expiration Time is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on
which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Closing Date_."

(g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the Company, except in
the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article IX_. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ , prior to the acceptance for payment of
the Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to
promptly return, all tendered Company Common Stock to the registered holders
thereof.

 



12 (h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO
shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein by reference or otherwise pursuant to which the Offer will be
made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in
writing all information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
that may be required by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to
the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information is or shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger
Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of
the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments
or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the
Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, relating to
the Offer Documents. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including
any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof
to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable
and good faith consideration to any such comments.

 

Section 2.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC, the Company shall file
with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the provisions of
_Section 7.5_, contain and reflect the Company Recommendation. The Company
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be prepared and
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required by applicable Laws or
reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information is or shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9,
as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders
of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt
of any comments

 



13  from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to
the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent and Merger Sub with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, relating to the Schedule 14D-9. Unless
the Company Board has effected a change in the Company Recommendation, prior
to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or supplements
thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule
14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or
response, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any such comments. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation contained in the Schedule
14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub mailing labels, security position
listings and any other available listings or computer files containing the
names and addresses of all record holders or beneficial owners of the shares
of Company Common Stock, in each case as of the most recent practicable date,
and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such information and assistance
(including lists of record holders or beneficial owners of the shares of
Company Common Stock, updated from time to time upon Parents, Merger Subs
or either of their respective agents reasonable request, and the addresses,
mailing labels and lists of security positions of such record holders or
beneficial owners) as Parent, Merger Sub or either of their respective agents
may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the
record holders and beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files and shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their agents and
Representatives to deliver) to the Company or destroy all copies and any
extract or summaries of such information then in their possession or control.

 

Section 2.3 _Directors_. Until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority
of the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by
Parent (the " _Existing Directors_ ") (or the approval of the sole Existing
Director if there shall only be one Existing Director) shall be required to
authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the
Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize)
(i) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of
this Agreement (including any decrease or change in the form of the Offer
Price), (iii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or
action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, and (iv) any waiver of
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the
benefit of the Company; _provided_ that if there shall be no Existing
Directors as a result of such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations
or refusals to serve, then such actions may be effected by a majority vote of
the Company Board. The Existing Directors will have the authority to retain
counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors
at the reasonable expense of the Company as determined appropriate by the
Existing Directors for the purpose of fulfilling their

 



14  obligations hereunder. Until the Effective Time, any action by the Company
to enforce any obligation of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement shall
be effected only by the action of a majority of the Existing Directors (or
the approval of the sole Existing Director if there shall only be one Existing
Director); _provided_ that if there shall be no Existing Directors as a result
of such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusals to serve,
then such actions may be effected by a majority vote of the Company Board.

Section 2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Section 2.4_, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price,
that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal
to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute
one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (the "
_Short Form Threshold_ "); _provided_ , that the Top-Up Option will not be
exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Top-
Up Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares). The Top-Up Option shall
be exercisable only once, in whole but not in part, at any time following
the Offer Closing and prior to the earliest to occur of (A) the close of
business on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Offer Closing, (B) the
Effective Time and (C) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

(b) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger
Sub shall notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing)
and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase which shall,
unless the Existing Directors otherwise agree, be at the Companys principal
offices not less than one (1) Business Day after receipt of such notice. The
Company shall, promptly following receipt of such notice, deliver written
notice to Merger Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger
Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub.
At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the aggregate purchase price
owed by Merger Sub to the Company for the Top-Up Shares (calculated by
multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by the Offer Price) shall be paid
to the Company at Parents election, either (i) entirely in cash, by wire
transfer of same-day funds or (ii) by issuing to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to
the Top-Up Option (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note (i) shall
bear simple interest at a rate of three percent (3.0%) per annum, (ii) shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution of the Promissory
Note, (iii) shall be full recourse to Parent and Merger Sub, (iv) may be
prepaid, at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and (v)
shall have no other material terms. The Company shall cause to be issued to
Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if the Company
does not then have certificated shares of Company Stock, the applicable number
of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any
legends that are required by the Company Charter or federal or state
securities Laws.

 



15 (c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that any Top-Up Shares issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act
and that all such shares will be issued in reliance upon an applicable
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is,
and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor,"
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

(d) If Merger Sub exercises the Top-Up Option and the number of Top-Up Shares
exceeds the number of shares of authorized Company Common Stock that at the
time of exercise are not outstanding, the Company Board will, as promptly as
practicable after Merger Sub exercises the Top-Up Option, approve an amendment
to the Company Charter increasing the number of shares of Company
Common Stock the Company is authorized to issue to a number that is
sufficient to enable the Company to issue to Merger Sub all of the Top-Up
Shares Merger Sub is to purchase as a result of exercise of the Top-Up Option
and such amendment will be duly executed and filed with and accepted for
record by the SDAT.

ARTICLE III

Section 3.2  _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall

waiver of such conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived by the party
entitled to the benefit of the same or at such other time and date as shall
be agreed upon by the parties. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall

ARTICLE IV

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER_

 

Section 4.1 _Effect on Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holder of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
held by any wholly owned Company Subsidiary, by Parent or by any Parent
Subsidiary shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto.

 



17 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_) shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive, in cash and without
interest, an amount equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
4.1(b)_, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share registered
in the transfer books of the Company (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 4.2_.

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. All shares of common stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain outstanding as shares of common stock of the Surviving Entity.

(d)  _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement
and subject to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, if at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company should split,
combine or otherwise reclassify the Company Common Stock or make a dividend
or other distribution in shares of Company Common Stock (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), or engage in a reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or
exchange or other like change, then (without limiting any other rights of
Parent or Merger Sub hereunder), the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration
(as applicable) shall be ratably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
such change.

Section 4.2 _Exchange Fund; Exchange Agent_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration,
as provided in _Section 4.1(b)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent cash in
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") for the sole benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, payments of the Merger Consideration
out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement, the Articles of
Merger and the Certificate of Merger. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. Any and all interest and other amounts earned on cash
deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving Entity.

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, Persons who held shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Entity for any reason shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

 



18 (c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent or the Surviving Entity
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection
by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal
(a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and
have such other customary provisions as the Company and Parent may reasonably
agree upon, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall
provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder, (1) Certificates may
be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise or (2) the Merger Consideration
in exchange therefor may be collected by check or wire transfer to the
surrendering holder).

 

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate by check or wire transfer, to be mailed or delivered by wire
transfer within two (2) Business Days following the later to occur of (A) the
Effective Time or (B) the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
customary exchange practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 4.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article IV_. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates.

 

(iii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent or the Surviving Entity
shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue and deliver to each holder of Book-
Entry Shares a check or wire transfer representing the Merger Consideration
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 4.1(b)_, in each case without such holder being required to deliver
a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and
such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Book-Entry Shares.

 



19 (iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall
be a condition of payment that any Certificate surrendered in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this _Section 4.2(c)_ shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, or any Book-Entry Share
shall be properly transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer Taxes and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration to which they are
entitled under this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the
Surviving Entity for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

Section 4.3 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

Section 4.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as

 



20  indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_.

Section 4.5 _Rights of Objecting Stockholders_. No rights of an objecting
stockholder (under MGCL Section 3-201 et seq. or otherwise) shall be available
with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after January 1, 2012 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ "). Each
Company SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its
date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of
registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, no Company Subsidiary is separately subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated,
if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared

consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders

the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability

Section 7.3 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required under the MGCL in order to
consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 3-106 of the MGCL, then,
in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws,
the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall establish a record date (which
will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Offer Closing)
for, duly call, give notice of and convene and hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting as promptly as practicable following the Offer Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting prior to the No Shop Period Start Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.3(a)_, if, on a
date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting;
_provided_ that the Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the
Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).

(b) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required under the MGCL in order
to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 3-106 of the MGCL,
then, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company
Bylaws, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Offer Closing,
the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form. Parent shall furnish all information concerning
itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its stock to the Company and provide
such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Proxy
Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by such other
party to be included therein. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise Parent of any oral
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to mailing the Proxy

 



50  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall cooperate and
provide to Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response).

(c) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that such document
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of
any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the
extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this
_Section 7.3(c)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section
7.3(b)_. For purposes of _Section 5.8_, _Section 6.4_ and this _Section
7.3_, any information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or
the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the
Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates
will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 

(d) The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder
Meeting as soon as practicable after the definitive Proxy Statement is filed
with the SEC. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its
stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent
that the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by  _Section 7.5(e)_. If the Company Stockholder Approval is
required under the MGCL in order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant
to Section 3-106 of the MGCL, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to relieve the Company of its obligation to submit the Merger to its
stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof. The Company agrees that,
unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section
9.1_, its obligations to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to
this _Section 7.3(d)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company
Acquisition Proposal or by any Adverse Recommendation Change.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if following the Offer and any subsequent
offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective subsidiaries shall hold, in the aggregate, at
least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action, including
with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of any shares of Company Common
Stock held by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Company
Stockholder Meeting in accordance Section 3-106 of the MGCL.

 



51 Section 7.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, and subject to the reasonable restrictions imposed from time to
time upon advice of counsel, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Parents financing sources and
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective
properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and,
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws,
and (ii) all other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its
business, properties and personnel Parent may reasonably request. Parent, at
its own expense, shall have the right to such reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice in order to prepare or
cause to be prepared surveys, inspections, engineering studies, environmental
assessments and other tests, examination or studies with respect to each
Company Property that Parent deems to be reasonably necessary, so long as
such access or activities do not unduly interfere with the Companys
operation of each such Company Property in the ordinary course of business.
Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the
Companys business that may result from its requests for access, data and
information hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required by this _Section 7.4_ to provide Parent, Parents financing sources
or their respective Representatives with access to or to disclose information
(w) relating to the consideration, negotiation and performance of this
Agreement and related agreements, (x) that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (y)
the disclosure of which would violate any Law or applicable fiduciary duty (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any Law or applicable fiduciary duty) or (z)
that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum
extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege).

(b) Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates to
hold, any nonpublic information of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will
otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) The Company agrees to give prompt written notice to Parent upon becoming
aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance
relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries which could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have
been previously granted to any Person other than Parent or any of its
Affiliates under any such provisions), or (vi) resolve, agree,
approve, recommend or publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

through any Representative, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Company Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party made after the date of this
Agreement (that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.5_; provided

of this _Section 7.5_) (i) furnish non-public information to such Third

concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to such
Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent or Merger
Sub, be provided to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or simultaneously with
providing it to such Third Party), and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives)
with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii): (x) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result
in, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
such Company Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of _Section
7.5_.

 

(d) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 7.5_, after the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify

54  thereof and the terms of any and all material agreements in connection
therewith (including any financing arrangements)), including by providing a

Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 and, if Company Stockholder

than pursuant to Section 3-106 of the MGCL, in the Proxy Statement, (iv) fail
to publicly recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal within ten (10)
Business Days of the request of Parent and/or reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of the request of Parent (any of
the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section
7.5(e)_, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve, adopt,
declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve,
adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company to
enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section
7.5_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Company Board shall be permitted
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board (x) has
received a _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from
a breach of this _Section 7.5_) that, in the good faith determination of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and
giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 7.5(f)_, and such Company Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn, and (y) determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law,
and in such case the Company may (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_, (ii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or (iii) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal to the Companys
stockholders and, in the case of a termination, the Company may immediately
prior to or concurrently with such termination of this Agreement, enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
(provided, that in the event of any such termination, the Company complies
with its obligation to pay the Termination Payment pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)(iii)_).

 

(f) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 7.5(e)_ unless (i) the Company
has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent
and Merger Sub that the Company intends to take such action, specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor and describing the material terms and
conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the Superior Proposal and the
terms of any and all agreements in connection therewith, including any
financing arrangements, that is the basis of such action (it being
understood that such material terms shall include the identity of the Third
Party), (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period following Parents and
Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub
in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and

 



55  conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii) following the end of the five (5)
Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking
into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and
Merger Sub in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that
the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require
a new Notice of Superior Proposal, and the Company shall be required to comply
again with the requirements of this _Section 7.5(f)_; _provided_ , _however_
, that references to the five (5) Business Day period above shall then be
deemed to be references to a three (3) Business Day period.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board
has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Company
Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation
to the Companys stockholders in favor of the Offer and the Merger shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change; and  _provided_ _further_ that
the taking of any such position or making of any such disclosure contemplated
by this _Section 7.5(g)_ shall not affect the Companys and the Company
Boards duties under this  _Section 7.5_.

(h) At the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective officers, directors and employees shall, and the Company
shall instruct and cause its and the Company Subsidiaries Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person conducted prior to the No Shop
Period Start Date with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and shall
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith. From and after the No Shop
Period Start Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors and employees shall, and the Company shall
instruct and cause its and the Company Subsidiaries Representatives to, take
such action as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or
provisions of similar effect to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a beneficiary.

 

(i) Except as expressly set forth in _Section 7.5(e)_, nothing in this
_Section 7.5_ shall (i) permit the Company to terminate this Agreement or
(ii) affect any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement. The
Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

 



56 (j) For purposes of this Agreement:

whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii)
any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of equity

percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-value
basis, (iii) any issue, sale or other disposition of (including by way of

any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into, such securities) representing
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (iv) any
tender offer or exchange offer in which any Person or "group" (as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall seek to

promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of the Company, or (v) any recapitalization,
restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar type of transaction
with respect to the Company in which a Third Party shall acquire beneficial
ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
term "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the
references in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" to "fifteen
percent (15%)" shall be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third
Party after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of _Section
7.5(b)_ on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of
the transaction described in such proposal, including the identity of the
Person making such proposal, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation, as well as any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in
response to such proposal or otherwise, to be (A) more favorable to the
Company and the Companys stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from
a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) fully financed, and (C) reasonably likely to receive all
required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably

57 Section 7.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any
contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as promptly as

this Agreement, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ and the Offer
Conditions to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities or
other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every
impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Offer or the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries or the Company
Subsidiaries, respectively, to give) any notices to Third Parties, and each of
Parent and the Company shall use, and cause each of their respective
Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any Third Party
consents not covered by _Section 7.6(a)_ that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Offer and the Merger. Each of the parties hereto
will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required
governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any
inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly informing the other
party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations
or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with

the others on, all the information relating to the other and each of their
Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that
confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted
from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither the Company
nor

 



58  Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to,
participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
without giving the other party the opportunity to attend or
participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such
Governmental Authority.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent, other than the Lender Consents, from
any Person (other than any Governmental Authority) with respect to the Offer
or the Merger, none of the Company, Parent, any of the Company Subsidiaries,
any of the Parent Subsidiaries or any of the their respective Representatives,
shall be obligated to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to
such Person. The parties shall cooperate with respect to accommodations that
may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions (including any of the conditions set forth on
_Exhibit A_ ) would reasonably expected to be incapable of being satisfied by
the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to provide such prompt
notice under this _Section 7.7(b)_ pursuant to clause (i) above shall not
constitute a breach of a covenant for purposes of paragraph (e) of _Exhibit
A_.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any Action commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such party or any of

relate to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this

Section 7.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall,
to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with

none of the parties shall issue any such press release or make any such
public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other parties consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without obtaining the
other parties consent, issue such press release or make such public
statement or filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules
of any stock exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of
any party hereto. If for any reason it is not practicable to consult with the
other party before making any public statement with respect to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, then the party making such
statement shall not make a statement that is inconsistent with public
statements or filings to which the other party had previously consented;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such consultation and consent shall not be
required with respect to any release, communication or
announcement specifically permitted by _Section 7.5_.

Section 7.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall provide exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for each Indemnitee, which is at
least as favorable in scope and amount to such Indemnitee as the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided to such Indemnitee by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws or each of the Company
Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational or governing documents), as in effect on the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses covers actions or omissions at or prior to the
Effective Time, including all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.9(a)_, during the
period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such Action arises
out of or pertains to (x) any action or omission or alleged action or omission
in such Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, partner, member,
trustee, employee or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such Action the expenses (including attorneys fees
and any expenses incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with enforcing any

 



60  rights with respect to indemnification) of any Indemnitee, without the
requirement of any bond or other security, upon receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent
or the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee
shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such
expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
coverage afforded by the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or
prior to the Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions and retentions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies and with limits of liability that are no lower than the
limits on the Companys existing policies as long as the annual premium in
the aggregate does not exceed 250% of the annual aggregate premium(s) under
the Companys existing policies. If the Company or the Surviving Entity for
any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in effect, for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for a period of not less than
six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under
the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides
coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable in the aggregate than the
existing policy of the Company (which may be provided under Parents DandO
Insurance policy) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.9_ applies are intended to be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.9_. The provisions of this
_Section 7.9_ are intended to be for

 



61  the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her successors, heirs, executors,
trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or representatives. Parent shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 7.9_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 7.9_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person or any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee or any employee with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries listed in _Section 5.12_ the Company Disclosure Letter.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.9_ is not
prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.7_
to the contrary, this _Section 7.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries,
and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.9_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent
guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations
pursuant to this  _Section 7.9_.

Section 7.10 _Dividends_. In the event that a distribution with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement
has (i) a record date prior to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid
as of the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall
be entitled to receive such distribution from the Company immediately prior
to the time such shares are exchanged pursuant to _Article IV_ of this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.11 _Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all actions
necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and (b) ensure that, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make
any investments or incur or guarantee any indebtedness other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.12  _Section 16 Matters_. The Company shall take all such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that any dispositions of Company
Common Stock (including

 



62  derivative securities related to such stock) resulting from the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act. 

Section 7.13 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of the Parent Subsidiaries as of
the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, if any, in favor of
approval of the Merger.

(i) the Offer Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party if the

principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Offer Closing to have
occurred on or before the Outside Date; or

 

(ii) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and such Order or other action shall have become final and
non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party

or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or

Payment in accordance with _Section 9.3(a)(iii)_.

 

(d) by Parent, if:

 

(i) prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements

and obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary (a) no such

Agreement; and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement, this  _Section 9.2_,
_Section 9.3_, _Section 9.6_, _Article X_ and the definitions of all

65 Section 9.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_, and in
any such case the Company (x) receives or has received a Company Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement and prior to termination of this
Agreement, which proposal has been publicly announced and (y) within twelve
(12) months of the termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction
regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which is later consummated with
respect to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent a fee equal to $1,463,000 (the " _Termination Fee_
") plus, if not previously paid pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)(ii)_ below, the
Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated
by Parent, not later than the consummation of such transaction arising from
such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes
of this _Section 9.3(a)(i)_, the references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in
the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)"; or

 

(ii) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Expense Amount (by wire
transfer to an account designated by Parent) within two (2) Business Days of
such termination; or

 

(iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee together with the
Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
Parent as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination; or

 

(iv) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee together with the Expense
Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent,
within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

 

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee or Expense Amount, as applicable, earlier than one (1) full
Business Day after receipt of appropriate wire transfer instructions from
Parent; and

(ii) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee or Expense Amount, as applicable, on more than one occasion.

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Payment is not a penalty, but
is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in
the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance 

 



66  on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, Parent would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 9.3_, the
Company shall pay Parent its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%)
for the period from the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

 

(d) (i) If the Company is required to pay to Parent the Termination Payment,
such Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment
is required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow account designated in
accordance with this _Section 9.3(d)_. In the event that the Company
is obligated to pay Parent the Termination Payment, the amount payable to
Parent in any tax year of Parent shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the
Termination Payment, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be
paid to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of
Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and Parent has
$1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by Parents independent
accountants, plus (B) in the event Parent receives either (x) a letter from
Parents counsel indicating that Parent has received a ruling from the IRS as
described below in this  _Section 9.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from Parents
outside counsel as described below in this _Section 9.3(d)_, an amount equal
to the excess of the Termination Payment less the amount payable under clause
(A) above. 

(ii) To secure the Companys obligation to pay these amounts, the Company
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Termination Payment
with an escrow agent selected by the Company on such terms (subject to this
_Section 9.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and
the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination
Payment pursuant to this _Section 9.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the
Company is obligated to pay Parent such amount pursuant to _Section 9.3_ by
wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination
Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i)
a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing Parent
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income and Parent has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such
year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall
release such amount to Parent, or (ii) a letter from Parents counsel
indicating that (A) Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that the
receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded 

 



67  from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code or (B) Parents outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the
effect that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Payment to
Parent. The Company agrees to amend this _Section 9.3(d)_ at the reasonable
request of Parent in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination
Payment that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii)
improve Parents chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this
_Section 9.3(d)_ or (iii) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal
opinion from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 9.3(d)_. Any
amount of the Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a
taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 9.3(d)_,
_provided_ that the obligation of the Company to pay the unpaid portion of the
Termination Payment shall terminate on the December 31 following the date
which is five (5) years from the date of this Agreement.

Section 9.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time before or after the Offer Closing or
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after the Offer Closing, no amendment shall
be made which decreases the Merger Consideration and no other amendment shall
be made without the approval required under _Section 2.3_, and (b) after the
Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any
amendment of this Agreement which by applicable Law requires the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further approval of
such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 9.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may, subject to  _Section 2.3_, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
and (c) subject to the proviso of _Section 9.4_, waive compliance with any
agreement or condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 

Section 9.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
and Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing, filing
and distribution of the Proxy Statement, if any, other than attorneys and
accountants fees.

 



68 Section 9.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax,
" _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from
any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the Company Common Stock,
all Transfer Taxes.

favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall include the Company

Section, Appendix or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or an Appendix or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated.

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other instrument

 



70  made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the
case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a
Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All references to
"dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of America. 

Section 10.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance
herefrom so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the Surviving Entity,
neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that Merger Sub may assign or
delegate (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), in its sole discretion,
any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to
any direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the
Company.

Section 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Section 10.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for the provisions of _Section 7.9_ (which shall be to the benefit of the
Persons referred to in such section). The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto
in accordance with _Section 9.5_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Accordingly, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



71 Section 10.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall

their respective Affiliates to dispose of, license or hold separate all or any
material portion of the business or assets of Parent, the Company or such
Affiliate, or (iv) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other Affiliates effectively to acquire,
hold or exercise full rights of ownership of any shares of Company Common
Stock or any capital stock of the Surviving Entity, including the right to
vote the shares of Company Common Stock or capital stock of the Surviving
Entity acquired or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other
Affiliates on all matters properly presented to the Companys stockholders;

(c) any Law enacted, entered, enforced, proposed, issued, in effect or deemed

Parent, is likely, directly or indirectly, to result in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of paragraph (b) above;

 

(d) (i) any of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
5.1(a)_ (Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries),  _Section 5.3(a)_
(Capital Structure) (except for the first two sentences), _Section 5.4_
(Authority), _Section 5.19_ (Opinion of Financial Advisor), _Section 5.20_
(Takeover Statutes), _Section 5.21_ (Vote Required), _Section 5.22_

correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement or at any
time prior to the Offer Closing as if made as and as of such time, (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in the first two sentences of
_Section 5.3(a)_ (Capital Structure) shall not be true and correct in all but
de minimis respects as of   the date of this Agreement or at any time prior to the Offer Closing as if
made as and as of such time, (iii) the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 5.8_ (Disclosure Documents) shall not be true and correct
in all respects as of the date of this Agreement or at any time prior to the
Offer Closing as if made as and as of such time, and (iv) each of the other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
shall not be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or at any time
prior to the Offer Closing as if made as and as of such time, except (x) in
each case, representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date
shall be true and correct only on and as of such date, and (y) in the case of
clause (iv) where the failure of such representations or warranties to be true
and correct (without giving effect to any materiality or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" qualifications set forth therein) does not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

 

(e) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any material respect
with any of its agreements, obligations or covenants under this Agreement
prior to the Expiration Time and such failure to perform or comply with such
other agreements, obligations or covenants shall not have been cured to the
good faith satisfaction of Parent;

 

(f) any revocation of the Ownership Limit Waivers shall have occurred since
the date of this Agreement;

 

(g) any of the consents, authorizations and approvals set forth on _Section
1.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall not have been obtained or shall
not be in full force and effect; or

(h) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

Immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company shall deliver to
Parent (i) a certificate, signed on behalf of the Company by a senior officer
of the Company and dated as of the Offer Closing Date, certifying that none of
the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (d) and (e) above shall have
occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer, and (ii) a
written opinion of Morris, Manning and Martin, LLP, or other counsel to the
Company satisfactory to Parent, dated as of the Offer Closing Date and in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that,
commencing with the Companys taxable year that ended on December 31, 2004,
the Company has been organized and operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and its
actual method of operation through the Offer Closing Date has enabled the
Company to meet and the Companys proposed method of operation will enable the
Company to continue to meet, through the Effective Time, the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code (the " _Offer REIT
Opinion_ "), which Offer REIT Opinion will be subject to customary exceptions,
assumptions and qualifications and based on customary representations
contained in an officers certificate executed by the Company and the Company
Operating Partnership. For the avoidance of doubt, the condition contained in
this paragraph regarding the Offer REIT Opinion shall not be waivable.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to any such  conditions, and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
applicable Law, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than the
Minimum Condition and the delivery of the Offer REIT Opinion). The failure by
Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
