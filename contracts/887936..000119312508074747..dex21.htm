ARTICLE III

3.1 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP,
153 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the
Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those that by their nature can
and will be satisfied only at the Closing), or such other date as the Parties
may mutually agree upon in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

3.2 _Purchase Price; Payments at Closing_.

(a) _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ")
for the Purchased Assets shall consist of the Cash Consideration and the
Share Consideration. The " _Cash Consideration_ " shall be equal to
$100,000,000, _plus_ the right to additional cash payment as and to the extent
set forth in _Section 3.4_. The " _Share Consideration_ " shall consist of
the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) $25,000,000 by (y) the average of the daily closing prices per
share of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the
Wall  



 

\- 7 -  Street Journal for the five (5) consecutive trading days prior to (and not
including) the Closing Date (such average, the " _Closing Date Value_ "). No
fraction of a share of Common Stock shall be issued, and each fractional share
thereof shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.

(b) _Outstanding Indebtedness_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall furnish to Buyer customary payoff letters from
all financial institutions and other Persons to which any Indebtedness of the
Seller is outstanding (other than the personal property leases set forth on
_Schedule 2.1(a)(iv)_ ), which payoff letters shall indicate the total amount
required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment or
similar payments, expenses and other obligations related to such Indebtedness
as of the Closing Date (the " _Debt Payoff Amount_ "). Seller shall at
Sellers election have the option to pay the Debt Payoff Amount directly out
of Sellers own funds in advance of Closing rather than have the Debt Payoff
Amount paid by Buyer and Parent out of the Cash Consideration at Closing, in
which case Seller shall provide evidence of such payment to Buyer. 

(c) _Payments at Closing_.

(i) At the Closing, Buyer and Parent (jointly and severally) shall (i) pay to
Seller the Closing Cash Payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Seller at least two Business Days prior
to Closing and (ii) pay the Debt Payoff Amount to the payees thereof by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the respective accounts designated
in the payoff letters with respect thereto. Any portion of the Cash
Consideration distributed by the Seller to its Members and Other Members
shall be in accordance with the Members and Other Members respective Share
Consideration Percentage Interest.

(ii) The Share Consideration shall be subject to certain restrictions set
forth in the Restricted Stock Agreements dated as of the Closing Date by
and among Parent, Seller and each of the Members (the " _Restricted Stock
Agreements_ "). At the Closing, the Share Consideration shall be issued by
Parent in the name of the Seller (for the account of the Members and Other
Members in accordance with their respective Share Consideration Percentage
Interest), but shall be retained by Parent until the respective dates upon
which such Share Consideration is no longer subject to restriction under the
corresponding Restricted Stock Agreement (the release date of such Share
Consideration, the " _Release Date_ "). Buyer and Parent shall deliver to the
Seller for the benefit of the Members and the Other Members (in accordance
with their respective Share Consideration Percentage Interests) the Share
Consideration on their applicable Release Dates, to the extent not cancelled
pursuant to _Section 10.6_, provided that if on or prior to an applicable
Release Date any claim by a Buyer Party has been made that could result in
Excess Losses and Buyer has notified the Members Representative of such in
writing, then there shall be withheld on such applicable Release Date such
amount of the Share Consideration (as determined as follows: (i) if such
Share Consideration is subject to the Stock Floor Guaranty (as defined in the
Restricted Stock Agreement), the greater of (x) the per share closing price of
the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the Wall
Street Journal on such Release Date (or if the New York Stock Exchange is not
open for trading on such date, the preceding trading date) or (y) the Closing
Date Value; or (ii) if such Share Consideration is not subject to the Stock
Floor Guaranty under the Restricted Stock Agreement, the per share closing
price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the
Wall Street Journal on such Release Date (or if the New York Stock Exchange is
not open for trading on such date, the preceding trading date)) necessary to
cover all Excess Losses, and such withheld amount (or the applicable portion
thereof) shall either be cancelled to satisfy a Loss suffered by a Buyer Party
or released to Seller for the benefit of the Members (or those of the Members
as shall be designated by Seller), as appropriate based upon final resolution
of each such claim in accordance with the terms of _Article X_ hereof.



 

\- 8 - 3.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) _Estimated Working Capital_.

(i) Seller shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Buyer, not more than
five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, a statement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ ") of the estimated Net Working Capital of the Seller as of
the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), together with a
reasonably detailed worksheet (and supporting schedules) setting forth the
calculation of the Estimated Working Capital, which shall be reasonably
acceptable to Buyer; provided _,_ however, that Buyers belief that the
Estimated Closing Statement and calculation of the Estimated Working Capital
is reasonable when given shall not foreclose, prevent, limit or preclude any
rights or remedy of Buyer set forth herein. The Seller shall provide Buyer
with reasonable access to the books and records (including financial
statements) of the Seller to verify the Estimated Closing Statement and the
balance sheet items reflected thereon.

(ii) The Cash Consideration payable at the Closing pursuant to _Section 3.2_
shall be (x) increased by fifty percent (50%) of the Working Capital Surplus
or (y) decreased by the Working Capital Deficit.

(iii) If and to the extent there is a Working Capital Surplus, then following
such time that Buyer receives cash from gross collections of accounts
receivable and work in progress included on the Estimated Closing Statement
and prior to December 31, 2008 (the " _Collection Period_ ") in an amount
equal to the Base Collection Amount, Buyer and Parent (jointly and severally)
shall, on a monthly basis, pay to Seller amounts collected in respect of
remaining accounts receivable and work in progress included in Estimated
Working Capital until an aggregate amount equal to the Working Capital
Surplus (including the portion of the Working Capital Surplus paid pursuant to
_Section 3.3(a)(ii)_ above) has been paid to Seller. Buyers obligation to
collect such accounts receivable and work in progress shall not extend to the
institution of litigation, employment of counsel, or any other extraordinary
means of collection, and Buyer shall not incur or cause to be incurred any
collateral or outside fees, costs or charges in connection with its efforts
at collection of such accounts receivable or work in progress without first
having obtained the authorization in writing of Seller. During the Collection
Period, unless authorized by Buyer, neither Seller nor its agents shall make
any solicitation for collection purposes or institute litigation for the
collection of any amounts due thereunder.

(b) _Final Working Capital_.

(i) Within 60 days following December 31, 2008, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Members Representative a statement (the " _Working Capital
Statement_ ") of the Net Working Capital of the Seller as of the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Working Capital_ "), which shall include a reasonably
detailed worksheet setting forth a calculation of Closing Working Capital.
For purposes of preparing the Working Capital Statement, any accounts
receivable of the Seller existing as of the Closing Date that were included in
the calculation of Estimated Working Capital but have not been paid to the
Buyer prior to delivery of the Working Capital Statement, and any work in
progress of the Seller existing as of the Closing Date that has not been
converted to accounts receivable and paid to the Buyer prior to delivery of
the Working Capital Statement, shall be disregarded (and not included as
current assets) for purposes of calculating the Net Working Capital pursuant
to this _Section 3.3(b)_. If requested by the Members Representative in
writing, Buyer will provide the Members Representative with all work papers
in the possession of Buyer used in preparation of the Working Capital
Statement.

(ii) The Members Representative shall have thirty (30) days following
delivery of the Working Capital Statement (the " _Objection Period_ ") to
accept or dispute the accuracy of  



 

\- 9 -  the Working Capital Statement. If the Members Representative has not given
any such written notice to Buyer on or prior to the expiration of
the Objection Period, the Members Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted the accuracy of the Working Capital Statement, and the Closing
Working Capital shall be deemed to be the final amount of Net Working Capital
as of the Closing Date as set forth in the Working Capital Statement (the "
_Final Working Capital_ "). If the Members Representative disputes the
accuracy of the Working Capital Statement, the Members Representative shall
in the notice of such dispute set forth in reasonable detail those items that
the Members Representative believes are not fairly presented or calculated
and the reasons for such opinion. The Parties shall then meet and in good
faith try to resolve their disagreements over the disputed items. If the
Parties resolve their disagreements in accordance with the foregoing sentence,
the Closing Working Capital with those modifications, if any, to which the
Parties shall have agreed shall be deemed to be the Final Working Capital. If
the Parties have not resolved their disagreements over the disputed items
within twenty (20) days after the Members Representative provides notice of
dispute, the Parties shall forthwith jointly submit a written notice of the
disputed items (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to an accounting expert that
is reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting Referee_
"). The Accounting Referee shall determine, based solely on the provisions of
this Agreement and the presentations by Buyer and the Members Representative
and their respective representatives, and not by independent review, only the
appropriate amount, inclusion or omission of the disputed items, and shall
modify the Working Capital Amount to conform to its determination within
thirty (30) days after it has been engaged. In resolving any disputed item,
the Accounting Referee: (x) shall limit its review to matters specifically
set forth in the Notice of Disagreement as a disputed item, (y) shall further
limit its review to whether the Closing Working Capital is mathematically
accurate and has been prepared in accordance with the definition of
Working Capital and (z) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either Party. The determination of the
Accounting Referee shall not, in the absence of manifest error, be subject to
contest. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by the
Party whose claimed Net Working Capital, as set forth on the Working Capital
Statement or Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, was further from the
Final Working Capital, as determined by the Accounting Referee.

(iii) Within three (3) Business Days after the final determination of the
Final Working Capital, in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)(ii)_ above,

(A) to the extent the Final Working Capital is less than the Target Working
Capital, then Seller and the Members, in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)(iv)_
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Buyer the following amounts, if any:

(1) if there was no Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital Surplus, then
an amount equal to the remainder of (x) Target Working Capital  _minus_ (y)
the Final Working Capital;

separately with the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to an application requesting confidential treatment under Rule 24b-2
of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.



(2) if there was a Working Capital Deficit, an amount equal to the
remainder of (x) Estimated Working Capital, _minus_ (y) the Final Working
Capital;

(3) if there was a Working Capital Surplus, an amount equal to (x) the
remainder of (i) Target Working Capital, _minus_ (ii) the Final Working
Capital, _plus_ (y) the amount of any Working Capital Surplus that was
actually paid to Seller (or its Members) pursuant to  _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_
and _Section 3.3(a)(iii)_; and

(B) to the extent the Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Working Capital, then Buyer and Parent (jointly and severally) shall pay to
the Seller (for the account of the Members and Other Members in accordance
with their respective Share Consideration Percentage Interest) the following
amounts, if any:

(1) if there was no Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital Surplus, then
an amount equal to the remainder of (x) Final Working Capital, _minus_ (y)
the Target Working Capital;

(2) if there was a Working Capital Surplus, an amount equal to the remainder
of (x) the Final Working Capital, _minus_ (y) Estimated Working Capital; and

(3) if there was a Working Capital Deficit, an amount equal to the remainder
of (x) Final Working Capital, _minus_ (y) the Estimated Working Capital.

(iv) All payments pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)_ shall be net of any
collected but unpaid amounts under _Section 3.3(a)(iii)_ above, and shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in advance by the Members Representative or Buyer, as applicable, following
final determination of the Net Working Capital in accordance with _Section
3.3(b)(ii)_ above. The obligation of Seller and the Members to make any
payment pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)(iii)(A)_ shall, as between Seller, on
the one hand, and the Members as a group, on the other hand, be joint and
several, but shall, as between and among the individual Members themselves, be
several (in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests) and not
joint.

3.4 _Earn-out Consideration_. In addition to the Cash Consideration and Share
Consideration, the Seller shall be entitled to additional consideration as
follows:

(a) If the Business Unit EBITDA for any of (1) the portion of fiscal year
2008 between the Closing Date and December 31, 2008, (2) each fiscal year
ending December 31 for each of the calendar years 2009 through 2012 and (3)
the Final Earn-out Period (collectively, the " _Earn-out Period_ ") exceeds
the EBITDA Hurdle for such period, then the Seller shall be entitled to
receive additional consideration equal to *** of such excess (the " _Earn-out
Consideration_ "); provided that in no event shall the aggregate amount of
Earn-out Consideration payable to Seller exceed $37,500,000. Any Earn-out
Consideration payable hereunder shall be subject to the following:

(i) to the extent any Earn-Out Consideration is payable directly to the
Seller, such amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Earn-
out Consideration calculated in accordance with this _Section 3.4_ for the
relevant period multiplied by the aggregate Earn-Out Consideration Percentage
Interests of the Ineligible Members, if any, and prior to any such payment,
Seller shall certify in writing to the Buyer that no portion of such payment
shall be distributed to any such Ineligible Member; and (ii) to the extent any Earn-Out Consideration is payable directly to the
Members (upon prior written direction of the Members Representative), the
amount payable shall be made severally to the Members in accordance with their
respective Earn-out Consideration Percentage Interests, provided that no
Ineligible Member shall receive his or her allocable portion of the Earn-Out
Consideration.

(b) With respect to each period during the Earn-out Period, (x) for each
period other than the Final Earn-out Period, no later than 10 days after the
filing of Parents annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC for such period or,
if such report is not timely filed by Parent, no later than 120 days after the
end of such fiscal year and (y) with respect to the Final Earn-out Period, no
later than 10 days following the filing of Parents quarterly report on Form
10-Q with the SEC for such period, or, if such report is not timely filed by
Parent, no later than 90 days after the end of such fiscal quarter, Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to the Members Representative a statement of income
of the Business as of the end of such period, together with a calculation of
the Business Unit EBITDA for such period then ended and a statement of the
amount, if any, of Earn-out Consideration payable with respect to such
completed period. Unless the Members Representative disputes Buyers
determination of the Business Unit EBITDA and Earn-out Consideration for the
relevant period in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.4(c)_,
Buyers determination for such period shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Members Representative and Seller. Parent and Buyer shall make available to
Seller all books and records maintained by Parent and Buyer as Seller may
reasonably require in order for Seller to review and confirm Buyers
calculation of Business Unit EBITDA.

(c) In the event that the Members Representative disputes the calculation of
the Business Unit EBITDA and Earn-out Consideration for any relevant period,
the Members Representative shall notify Buyer in writing by delivery of a
notice (an " _Earn-out Dispute Notice_ ") within 30 days after delivery of
Buyers calculation of the Business Unit EBITDA and Earn-out Consideration
for such period, which Earn-out Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such dispute. Any such dispute shall be resolved under
the procedures set forth in _Section 3.3(b)(ii)_ of this Agreement. If the
Members Representative does not deliver an Earn-out Dispute Notice within 30
days after delivery of Buyers calculations, within 10 days after expiration
of such 30 day period, or, if such a notice is timely delivered, within 10
days of the resolution of any such dispute, Buyer and Parent (jointly and
severally) shall pay Seller any Earn-out Consideration that is owed to Seller.
Subject to _Section 3.4(a)_ and _Section 10.6_, such Earn-out Consideration
shall be delivered by Buyer and Parent by wire transfers of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the
Members Representative.

(d) During the Earn-out Period, Parent shall:

(i) maintain separate accounting of the Business Unit for purposes of
determining the Earn-out Consideration;

(ii) not dispose of all or a material portion of the Purchased Assets or
operations of the Business to a third party or take any steps to wind up the
Business; and

(iii) not require the Business to enter into any transaction other than in
the ordinary course of business and on arms-length terms (unless such
transaction will not affect Business Unit EBITDA or unless equitable
adjustments are made in the calculation of Business Unit EBITDA to prevent
any distortion in the calculation of Earn-out Consideration).

(e) The Seller (and the Members Representative on behalf of the
Members) recognize that the contributions of the Members to the ongoing
success of the Business are essential and that if any  



 

\- 2 -  Member ceases to be a full time employee of Buyer or its Affiliates during
the Earn-out Period, Business Unit EBITDA could be negatively impacted due to
the cost incurred to replace each such former Business Employee. In addition,
Seller (and the Members Representative on behalf of each Member) agrees and
acknowledges that the Buyer Parties may make from time to time such business
decisions as they deem appropriate in the conduct of the Business Units
business, including actions that may have an impact on Business Unit EBITDA,
Acquired Entity EBITDA and achievement of all or any portion of Earn-out
Consideration. Seller (and their respective Members) shall have no right to
claim any lost Earn-out Consideration or other damages as a result of such
decisions so long as the actions were not taken by the Buyer Parties in bad
faith for the sole purpose of frustrating provisions of this _Section 3.4_,
except to the extent that any such decision shall constitute a violation of
_Section 3.4(d)_.

(f) Buyer may elect to set-off against all or a portion of any Earn-out
Consideration payable to Seller any amount owed to the Buyer Parties under the
indemnification obligations set forth in _Article X_ , as and to the extent
set forth therein. 

3.5 [ _Reserved_ ].

3.6  _Allocation of the Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets in accordance with
the principles set forth on _Schedule 3.6_. Buyer shall deliver for Sellers
approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) schedule setting forth the
Purchased Assets and such allocation within one hundred twenty (120) days
after the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller shall file any Tax Returns and any
other governmental filings on a basis consistent with the agreed-upon
allocation of fair market value and in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code. Buyer and Seller shall exchange drafts of any information returns
required by Section 1060 of the Code, and any similar state statute that is
applicable, at least thirty (30) days prior to filing such returns and shall
discuss in good faith any modification suggested by the receiving Party.

3.7 _Nonassignable Contracts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, to the extent that the assignment hereunder by Seller to Buyer of any
Assumed Contract is not permitted or is not permitted without the consent of
any other party to such Assumed Contract, this Agreement shall not be deemed
to constitute an assignment of any such Assumed Contract if such consent is
not given or if such assignment otherwise would constitute a breach of, or
cause a loss of contractual benefits under, any such Assumed Contract. Seller
shall advise Buyer in writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing with respect to any Assumed Contract which Seller knows or has
substantial reason to believe will or may not be subject to assignment to
Buyer hereunder at the Closing. Without in any way limiting Sellers
obligation to obtain all consents and waivers necessary for the sale,
transfer, assignment and delivery of the Assumed Contracts and the Purchased
Assets to Buyer hereunder as required by this Agreement, if any such consent
is not obtained or if such assignment is not permitted irrespective of
consent and if the Closing shall occur, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer at
Buyers expense following the Closing Date in any reasonable arrangement
designed to provide Buyer with the rights and benefits (subject to the
obligations) under any such Assumed Contract, including enforcement for the
benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of Seller against any other party
arising out of any breach or cancellation of any such Assumed Contract by such
other party and, if requested by Buyer, acting as an agent on behalf of Buyer
or as Buyer shall otherwise reasonably require, and Buyer shall pay and
perform all Assumed Liabilities in respect of any such Assumed Contract to the
extent arising subsequent to Closing.



 

\- 3 - ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER_

As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, Seller hereby represents and warrants to
Buyer that:

4.1 _Organization and Corporate Power_. Seller is a limited liability company
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of New Jersey. Seller has obtained and currently maintains all
qualifications to do business as a foreign person in all other jurisdictions
in which the character of Sellers properties or the nature of Sellers
activities require it to be so qualified, other than any such qualifications
for which the failure to obtain or maintain would not have a material adverse
effect on the Business. Seller has all requisite power and authority and all
material authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own and operate the
Business and to conduct the Business as now conducted and as
presently proposed to be conducted.

4.2 _Authorization; No Breach_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby to be executed and delivered by each Seller
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all requisite action on the part of
Seller, and no other proceedings on the part of Seller or its members are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby. This Agreement and the
other agreements contemplated hereby to be executed and delivered by each
Seller constitute valid and binding obligations of Seller, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.2_ , the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by Seller, and, assuming termination or
expiration of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate, conflict
with or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or
an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under,
require any consent, waiver or approval under, or require any offer to
purchase or any prepayment of any debt or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the Purchased Assets under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of (i) the certificate of formation or operating agreement of
Seller, (ii) any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree,
order, injunction, writ, permit or license of any domestic or
foreign federal, state, local or other governmental authority or regulatory
agency, commission, department or other governmental subdivision, court,
tribunal or body (a " _Governmental Authority_ ") applicable to Seller, or any
of its properties or assets, or (iii) any loan or credit agreement, bond,
debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, guarantee, lease or license to which
either Seller is a party or by which either Seller or any of its properties or
assets may be bound or affected or upon any Assumed Contract, other than, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, such violations, conflicts,
breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations, offers, prepayments or
creations of Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.3 _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_.

(a) _Schedule 4.3_ sets forth, as of the date of the Closing, the name of each
Person that owns membership interests in Seller, and the Share Consideration
Percentage Interest and Earn-out  



 

\- 4 -  Consideration Percentage Interest held by each such Person in Seller. The
outstanding membership interests have been duly authorized, and are validly
issued. Other than the membership interests listed on _Schedule 4.3_ , as of
the Closing Seller does not have any other outstanding partnership or
membership interests, units (whether general or limited), other interests that
confer on a Person the right to receive a share of the profits and losses of,
or distribution of assets of, the issuing entity (collectively, " _Capital
Interests_ ").

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ , Seller does not have any
Subsidiaries, nor does Seller own or hold the right to acquire any shares of
stock or any other security or interest in any other Person or have any
obligation to make any investment in any Person. Each Subsidiary listed on
_Schedule 4.3_ is either wholly owned by Seller or a direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Seller as indicated in _Schedule 4.3_. Each of the Subsidiaries
identified in _Schedule 4.3_ is qualified to conduct business and is in good
standing or is active, as the case may be, under the laws of each jurisdiction
wherein the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property
requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ , there are no currently
outstanding or authorized options, warrants, rights, contracts, rights of
first refusal or first offer, calls, preemptive rights, puts, rights to
subscribe, conversion rights, or other agreements or commitments to which
Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller is a party or which are binding upon Seller
or any Subsidiary of Seller providing for the issuance, disposition, or
acquisition of any Capital Interests or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any Capital Interests. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_
, there are no outstanding or authorized equity appreciation, phantom equity,
or similar rights with respect to Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller and
there are no shareholder, voting trust, proxies, or other agreements or
understandings to which Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller is a party or to
which it is bound relating to Sellers or any Subsidiary of Sellers Capital
Interests. 

4.4 _Financial Statements_. Attached hereto as _Schedule 4.4_ are true and
complete copies of (i) the audited balance sheet of Seller for the year ended
December 31, 2007 (the " _Latest Balance Sheet_ "), and the related statements
of income, changes in owners equity and cash flows for the twelve-month
period then ended (the " _Seller Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the
audited combined balance sheet of The Schonbraun McCann Group for the years
ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the related statements of

ended (the " _SMG Financial Statements_ "). The Seller Financial Statements
(including in all cases the notes thereto) are consistent with the books and
records of Seller, fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition of Seller as of December 31, 2007 and the operating results of
Seller for the year 2007, and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied. The SMG Financial Statements (including in all cases
the notes thereto) are consistent with the books and records of SMG LLP fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition of SMG LLP as of the
respective dates thereof and the operating results of SMG LLP for the periods
covered thereby, and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied. The results of operations of SMG LLPs consulting segment for the
years 2006 and 2005 are fairly presented in note 12 to the SMG
Financial Statements.

4.5 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.5_ , neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has and will have material
obligations or liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent,
unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to become due and regardless of when
or by whom asserted), except (i) liabilities reflected on the face of the
Latest Balance Sheet and (ii) liabilities and obligations which have arisen
after the date of the Latest Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business
(none of which is a liability for breach of contract, breach of
warranty, tort, infringement, claim or lawsuit) that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



 

\- 5 - 4.6 _Absence of Certain Developments_. Since December 31, 2007, Seller has
operated itself and its Subsidiaries and conducted the Business only in the
ordinary course of business and has not experienced or suffered any Material

(a) Seller owns, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens),
all right, title and interest in or to, or has the right to use pursuant to a
valid and enforceable written license, all Proprietary Rights necessary for or
used in the operation of the Business as currently conducted and as currently
proposed to be conducted (" _Seller Proprietary Rights_ "). _Schedule 4.11_
sets forth a complete and  



 

\- 9 -  correct list of all of the following that are either owned or used by Seller
or a Subsidiary of Seller in the conduct of the Business: all patented
or registered Proprietary Rights and pending patent applications or other
applications for registration of Proprietary Rights owned or used by Seller;
all trade names all material unregistered trademarks; and all material
computer software (other than commercially available, off-the-shelf computer
software).

(b) No outstanding claim by any third party contesting the
validity, enforceability, patentability, registrability, use or ownership of
any of the Seller Proprietary Rights owned by Seller or any Subsidiary of
Seller has been made, is currently pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, is
threatened.

(c) Neither the conduct of the Business nor any Seller or any Subsidiary of
Seller has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict
with any rights of any third parties, nor will any infringement,
misappropriation or conflict occur as a result of the continued operation of
the Business as currently conducted or as currently proposed to be conducted,
and neither Seller nor any Subsidiary of Seller has received any threats or
notices regarding any of the foregoing (including any demands or offers to
license any Proprietary Rights from any other person), and to the Knowledge of
Seller, no third party has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise conflicted
with any of the Seller Proprietary Rights.

(d) All of the Seller Proprietary Rights owned by Seller shall be owned by
Buyer immediately after the Closing on terms and conditions identical to those
under which Seller owned such Seller Proprietary Rights immediately prior to
the Closing, and all licensed software and any other Seller Proprietary
Rights held under license (other than commercially available, off-the-shelf
computer software), shall be available for use by Buyer immediately after the
Closing on substantially the same terms and conditions as the applicable
license agreements under which Seller used such Seller Proprietary Rights
immediately prior to the Closing. Seller has taken all necessary and desirable
action to maintain, protect and enforce the material Seller Proprietary Rights
owned by Seller. 

(e) The computer systems, including the software, firmware, hardware,
networks, interfaces, platforms and related systems used in the conduct of
the Business (collectively, the " _Seller Systems_ ") are generally sufficient
for the immediate and anticipated future needs of the Business. All Seller
Systems, other than software, used in the Business are owned or leased, as
the case may be, and operated by and are under the control of Seller and are
not wholly or partly dependent on any facilities which are not under the
ownership, operation or control of Seller. In the last eighteen (18) months,

other adverse events affecting such Seller Systems that have caused or could
reasonably be expected to result in the material or prolonged disruption or
interruption in or to the use of such Seller Systems and/or the conduct of
the Business.

material actions, suits, proceedings, orders or investigations pending or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against or affecting Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Business or the Purchased Assets at law or in equity before
or by any Governmental Authority. The Seller is not engaged in any legal
action with any Client to recover monies due the Seller or for damages
sustained by the Seller. Seller and its Subsidiaries are not subject to or
bound by any outstanding orders, judgments or decrees of any court or
governmental entity with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets, or the
Assumed Liabilities.

4.13 _Employees_.

(a) To the Knowledge of Seller, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.13_ , no
key employee and no group of employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
has any plans to terminate or modify (adverse to the Seller) his or her status
as an employee of the Business, including upon consummation of  



 

\- 10 -  the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.13_
, there are no claims, actions, proceedings or investigations pending or,
to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to or by any employee or former employee of Seller
or its Subsidiaries arising out of or based on the employment relationship
with Seller or its Subsidiaries or the performance of services on behalf of
Seller and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there are no claims, actions,
proceedings or investigations pending or threatened against any employees or
former employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries. During the five (5) years
preceding the date hereof, Seller and its Subsidiaries have not experienced
any strikes, grievances, claims of unfair labor practices or other collective
bargaining disputes. Seller has not engaged in any unfair labor practices. To
the Knowledge of Seller, there are no organizational efforts presently made or
threatened by or on behalf of any labor union with respect to the Business
Employees.

(b) Seller has set forth on _Schedule 4.13_ a true, complete and accurate list
as of February 1, 2008 of each Business Employee (disregarding the reference
in such definition to the Closing Date for purposes of this _Section
4.13(b)_) and with respect to each such Business Employee as of the date
hereof, his or her date(s) of hire by the Seller (or its Subsidiaries),
position and title (if any), current rate of compensation (including
bonuses, commissions and incentive compensation, if any), whether such

employee became inactive, the reason for such inactive status and, if

(c) With respect to this transaction, any material notice required under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or comparable
law applicable to Seller and its Subsidiaries has been given, and all
bargaining obligations, if any, with any employee representative of the
Business Employees have been, or prior to the Closing will be, satisfied.

4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a)  _Schedule 4.14_ lists or describes each material "employee benefit plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and each other material
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of any kind, maintained
or contributed to by (or required to be maintained or contributed to by)
Seller or with respect to which Seller has any liability. Each item listed or
required to be listed on _Schedule 4.14_ is referred to herein as a " _Seller
Employee Benefit Plan_."

(b) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate maintain, contribute to or have any
liability with respect to : (i) a "defined benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(35) of ERISA or any other plan subject to the funding requirements

reasonably be expected to result in any liability with respect to Buyer, or
(ii) a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA. No Seller Employee Benefit Plan is an employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement that provides for post-employment medical, life insurance or
other welfare-type benefits (other than health continuation coverage required
by COBRA).

(c) Each Seller Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter
to that effect from the Internal Revenue Service, and, to the Knowledge
of Seller, nothing has occurred since the date of such letter that cannot be
cured within the remedial amendment period provided by Section 401(b) of the
Code which would prevent any such Seller Employee Benefit Plan from remaining
so qualified. Except as set forth and described in reasonable detail on
_Schedule 4.14_ , each Seller Employee Benefit Plan and any related trust,
insurance contract or fund has been maintained and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its respective terms and the terms of
any applicable collective bargaining agreements and in compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations, including ERISA and the Code.

  

 

\- 11 - (d) Except as set forth and described in reasonable detail on _Schedule 4.14_
, none of Seller Employee Benefit Plans obligates Seller to pay any

change in control or ownership within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code.

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.14_ , (i) no Purchased Asset is subject
to any Lien under ERISA or the Code; (ii) neither Seller nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for
contributions not yet due) or to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(other than for payment of premiums not yet due) with respect to any Seller
Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan; and (iii) there are no
pending or threatened actions, suits, investigations or claims with respect to
any Seller Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits)
which could result in any liability to Buyer (whether direct or indirect), and
no facts which could give rise to (or be expected to give rise to) any such
actions, suits, investigations or claims to the Knowledge of Seller.

(f) With respect to each Seller Employee Benefit Plan listed on _Schedule
4.14_ , Seller has furnished to Buyer true and complete copies, as and if
applicable, of (i) summary plan descriptions and summaries of material
modifications and (ii) the most recent determination letter received from the

any valid set-off or counterclaim, (iv) are not the subject of any claim or

agreement for deduction, free goods, discount or other deferred price or
quantity adjustment has been made with respect to any such receivables. The
reserves with respect to accounts receivable of Seller and its Subsidiaries
reflected in the Latest Balance Sheet are reasonable based on historical
collections of accounts receivable by Seller and, to the Knowledge of Seller,
have been made in good faith based on all relevant information as of the date
of preparation of such balance sheets.

4.16 _Accounts Payable_. The accounts payable included in the Estimated
Closing Statement have arisen in bona fide arms-length transactions in the
ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past custom and
practice, and, as of the Closing, the Company will have paid its accounts

any such Governmental Authority and its respective staff on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. If
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or any other law, or if any statute,
rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Authority that
would make the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation thereof,
each of Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in all respects with the other and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any and all objections as
may be asserted with respect to this Agreement under the HSR Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall not be required to take
any commercially unreasonable action that substantially impairs the
overall benefits expected to be realized from the consummation of the
transactions set forth herein, and in no event shall Buyer be required to (i)
sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of the assets to be acquired in this
transaction or any of Buyers or their Affiliates other assets or businesses
now owned or hereafter acquired by Buyer to resolve any objection or
proceeding objecting to the transactions contemplated hereunder or (ii)
terminate any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations.
All filing fees and expenses relating to the Notification and Report Form
filed pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by Buyer.

third party from whom consent or approval is requested (other than filing fees
and similar expenses required to be paid to a Governmental Authority in
connection with any request for a necessary waiver, consent or approval or as
otherwise contemplated herein) or make any commercially unreasonable
accommodation or concession to any Governmental Authority or third party in
connection with the foregoing.

7.5 _Exclusive Dealing_. Neither the Seller nor any Member will (and
each shall cause its Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly, through any
officer, director, partner, employee, investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative of any of them or otherwise, take
any action to encourage, solicit or initiate or continue any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person (other than Buyer

Member will promptly notify Buyer orally and in writing of the existence of
any proposals by a third party to do any of the foregoing which the Seller,
any Member or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors or other representatives may receive
relating to any of such matters.

7.6 _Tail Insurance_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall have obtained
"claims-made" errors and omissions insurance coverage or "tail" insurance
from a carrier reasonably acceptable to Buyer, naming Buyer as an additional
insured, with aggregate liability limits at least equal to Sellers current
errors and omissions coverage, for acts or omissions arising in the operation
or conduct of the Business prior to the Closing.

7.7 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller shall
promptly disclose to Buyer in writing any (a) event, circumstance or
development that results (or would result on the Closing Date) in a breach of
any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement and (b)
any material failure of the Seller or the Members, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ that no disclosure pursuant to this

_POST-CLOSING COVENANTS_  

9.1 _Employee Related Matters_.

(a) _Transferred Employees_. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer
employment to those Business Employees actively employed as of the Closing
Date, and Seller shall take all steps necessary to terminate the employment of
each such Business Employee who accepts such offer of employment. The
Business Employees who accept Buyers offer of employment and who become
employed by Buyer shall be referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_."
Any Business Employee that, as of the Closing Date, is on short-term or long-
term disability leave shall be offered employment by Buyer if he or she
presents herself for work in accordance with the policies of the Seller within
90 days of the Closing Date. At such time, such Business Employee shall
become a "Transferred Employee." Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon
any Transferred Employee any right with respect to continued employment with
Buyer, nor shall anything herein limit or interfere with Buyers right to
terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee at any time (subject to
applicable law), with or without cause or notice, or restrict Buyer in the
exercise of independent business judgment in modifying any terms or
conditions of employment of the Transferred Employees on and after the Closing
Date. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions necessary to
vest each Transferred Employee in their benefits under Seller Employee Benefit
Plans and shall make all employee and employer contributions to Seller
Employee Benefit Plans in which Transferred Employees currently participate,
for all periods of employee service prior to the Closing Date for all
Transferred Employees. The Transferred Employees shall participate in the
employee benefit plans established and maintained by Parent and its  



 

\- 22 -  Subsidiaries from time to time, and the Transferred Employees shall receive
full credit, including for purposes of eligibility and vesting, for their
prior periods of service with Seller, SMG LLP or their Subsidiaries. Buyer
and Parent shall (i) waive (with respect to the Transferred Employees) any
limitations as to preexisting conditions and any exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation in and coverage under Parents employee
benefit plans, and (ii) recognize and credit any copayments and deductibles
paid by Transferred Employees prior to Closing for purposes of satisfying any
applicable copayment or deductible requirements under Parents employee
benefit plans for the same plan year(s).

(b) _Other Matters_. Seller shall be responsible for all liabilities,
obligations and commitments relating to compensation of the Transferred
Employees arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any severance compensation and bonus payments. 

(c) _Mutual Cooperation_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Seller
shall provide promptly to Buyer, at Buyers request, any information or
copies of personnel records (including addresses, dates of birth, date of hire
and dependent information) relating to the Business Employees or relating to
the service of Business Employees with Seller (and predecessors of
Seller) prior to the Closing Date. Seller and Buyer shall each cooperate with
the other and shall provide to the other such documentation, information and
assistance as is reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of this
_Section 9.1_. 

(d) _No Third Party Rights_. The Parties do not intend this _Section 9.1_ to
create any rights or interests, except as among Buyer and Seller, and no
present, former or future employee of Buyer or Seller shall be treated as a
third party beneficiary by, in or under this _Section 9.1_. The covenants
contained in this _Section 9.1_ do not constitute a modification or
amendment of any employee benefit plan.

(e) _Long-Term Incentive Plans_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall grant
options pursuant to the terms of Parents 2006 Global Long-Term Incentive Plan
to purchase one hundred thousand (100,000) shares of Common Stock to employees
and Members of Seller (other than those Members listed on _Schedule 9.1(e)_ )
mutually agreed to by Seller and Buyer.

9.2 _Confidentiality_. After the Closing, Seller shall continue to maintain
the confidentiality of all Confidential Information, except to the extent
information is required to be disclosed to its auditors, attorneys, financial
advisors and other consultants, agents and advisors in connection with post-
Closing matters hereunder or other matters as to which the Seller has
retained obligations or liabilities hereunder or otherwise as required by
applicable law. In the event Seller is required by law to disclose any
Confidential Information, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing,
which notification shall include the nature of the legal requirement and the
extent of the required disclosure, and shall cooperate with Buyer to preserve
the confidentiality of such information consistent with applicable law. Prior
to Closing, Buyer and Parent shall continue to abide by the provisions of the
existing confidentiality agreement between Seller and Parent, which shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect against Buyer, Parent or their
Affiliates following Closing.

9.3 _Sales and Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, excise, value-added, goods and
services, transfer, recording, documentary, registration, conveyancing and
similar taxes that may be imposed on the sale and transfer of the Purchased
Assets (including any stamp, duty or other tax chargeable in respect of any
instrument transferring property and any recording fees or expenses payable
in connection with the sale and transfer of the Proprietary Rights), together
with any and all penalties, interest and additions to tax with respect
thereto, shall be paid fifty-percent (50%) by Seller and the remaining fifty-
percent (50%) by Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in timely making all
filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the
provisions of applicable law in connection with the payment of any such
taxes described in the immediately preceding sentence. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate in providing each other with appropriate resale exemption
certification and other similar tax and fee documentation.



 

\- 23 - 9.4 _Covenant Not to Compete, Solicit or Hire; Confidentiality_.

(a) Each Member hereby acknowledges that such Person is familiar with the
Business trade secrets and with other Confidential Information. Each Member
acknowledges and agrees that Buyer and its Affiliates would be irreparably
damaged if such Member were to provide services or to otherwise participate in
the business of any Person competing with the Business in a similar business
and that any such competition by such Member would result in a significant
loss of goodwill by Buyer in respect of the Business. Each Member further
acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set forth in this
_Section 9.4_ were a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and that Buyer and its
Affiliates would not obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this
Agreement as specifically negotiated by the parties hereto if such Member
breached the provisions of this _Section 9.4_. Therefore, in further
consideration of the amounts to be paid hereunder for the Purchased Assets and
the goodwill of the Business sold in connection therewith, each Member agrees
that during the Noncompete Period such Member shall not, and shall not permit
any of such Members Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, either for itself,
himself or herself or through any other Person, engage in, lend money
to, participate in or permit such Members name to be used by any enterprise
engaging in or participating in, a business comparable with, related to and
competitive with the services provided by Seller, including any service
offering introduced following Closing through the last date that such Member
remains an employee of Buyer or its Affiliates, (a " _Competing Business_ ").
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "participate" includes any direct or
indirect interest in any enterprise, whether as a stockholder, member,
partner, joint venturer, franchisor, franchisee, executive, consultant or
otherwise (other than by ownership of less than five percent (5%) of the stock
of a publicly held corporation) or rendering any direct or indirect service
or assistance to any Person. Each Member agrees that this covenant is
reasonably designed to protect Buyers substantial investment and is
reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.

(b) Each Member agrees that for a period of five years following the Closing
Date, each such Member shall not (and such Member shall cause its, his or her
Affiliates not to) directly, or indirectly through another Person, (i) induce
or attempt to induce (other than by a general solicitation advertisement,
posting or similar job solicitation process) any employee of the Business to
leave the employ of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or in any
way interfere with the relationship between Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates and any such employee (except for actions taken in an executive
capacity on behalf of Buyer to terminate such employees employment with Buyer
where termination is deemed necessary or advisable), (ii) hire (other than by
a general solicitation advertisement, posting or similar job solicitation
process) any person who was an employee of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates at any time during the one-year period immediately prior to the
date on which such hiring would take place, or (iii) call on, solicit
or service any Client, Prospective Client or other business relation of the
Business in order to induce or attempt to induce such Person to cease doing or
decrease their business with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer,
supplier, licensee or business relation and Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (including making any negative statements or communications
about Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates); provided that the
restriction set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall not apply in the
case of any clerical employee or other employee whose employment has been
terminated for at least one year.

(c) Each Member shall maintain as confidential and shall not directly or
indirectly, use, disclose, or publish any Confidential Information that
such Member may have learned or have become aware of because of such Members
association with the Seller, or use any such Confidential Information  



 

\- 24 -  in a manner that is or may reasonably be likely to be detrimental to the
Business (except as required by law or as authorized in writing by Buyer, or
in connection with their performance as employees of the Buyer or its
Affiliates following the Closing). In the event any Member is required by law
to disclose any Confidential Information, such party shall promptly notify
Buyer in writing, which notification shall include the nature of the legal
requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and shall cooperate
with Buyer to preserve the confidentiality of such information consistent with
applicable law.

(d) If, at the time of enforcement of any of the provisions of this _Section
9.4_, a court determines that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable
under the circumstances then existing, then the Parties hereto agree that the
maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under the circumstances
shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area. The Parties
further agree that such court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions
contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope or geographical area
permitted by law.

(e) If a Member or any of its Affiliates (the " _Restricted Persons_ ")
breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this
_Section 9.4_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), Buyer shall have the
following rights and remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be
independent of the others and severally enforceable, and each of which is in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to
Buyer at law or in equity:

(i) The right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically
enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed that any
breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause
irreparable injury to Buyer and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Buyer; and

(ii) The right and remedy to require the Restricted Persons to account for and
pay over to Buyer any profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits
derived or received by the Restricted Persons as the result of any
transactions constituting a breach of the Restrictive Covenants.

(f) The restrictions contained in this _Section 9.4_ shall be in addition to,
and shall in no way limit, or be limited by, any restrictive covenants
contained in any employment, consulting, severance or similar agreement
between a Member, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other.

(g) Neither Seller nor any other Member shall be responsible or liable for
the performance by a Member of his or her obligations under this _Section
9.4_, and a Members violation of this _Section 9.4_ shall be actionable only
in respect of the violating Member, and not Seller or any other Member.

9.5 _Use of Name_. From and after the Closing, except as may be required by or
pursuant to _Section 3.7_ or requested by Buyer in writing, Seller shall
amend its organizational documents so as to delete therefrom the Business
Marks and will file, as promptly as practicable, such documents as are
necessary to reflect such name change in its states of formation or
organization and the other jurisdictions where they are qualified to do
business as a Foreign Person. From and after the Closing Date, Seller agrees
it will not adopt any name that is confusingly similar to, or a derivation of,
the Business Marks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall be entitled
to use the Business Marks for purposes of prosecuting or defending third-party
claims (including claims for indemnification from third parties), filing and
appealing tax returns, and for legitimate business purposes associated with
the wind-down and dissolution of Seller, when they occur; provided that the
Seller provides Buyer with prior written notice of such use.



 

\- 25 - 9.6 _Collections_. After the Closing, (x) Seller shall promptly (but in no
event later than ten (10) days after receipt thereof) deliver to Buyer any
cash, checks or other property that it receives in connection with or relating
to the Purchased Assets and operation of the Business following the Closing
and (y) Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than ten (10) days after
receipt thereof) deliver to SMG LLP any cash, checks or other property that it
receives in connection with or relating to the operation of the business of
SMG LLP following the Closing. 

9.7 _Rule 144_. With a view toward making available to Seller (and the
Members) the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and
any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit Seller
(and the Members) to sell Common Stock received pursuant to this Agreement to
the public without registration, Parent agrees to use reasonable
best efforts, until such date as compliance shall no longer be required in
order to permit such sales, to comply with the requirements of SEC Rule
144(c), or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities Act,
with respect to current public information about Parent.

recover on account thereof, but for this _Section 10.3_, exceeds $600,000 in
the aggregate (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which event the Buyer Parties or
Seller, as applicable, shall be entitled to recover for all Losses in excess
of the Basket Amount; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall
not apply to recovery for an inaccuracy in or breach of _Section 4.9_ (Taxes)
or of any Fundamental Representation.

(b) Other than with respect to _Section 10.2(a)(i)(3)_, _Section
10.2(a)(i)(5)_ and fraud, the aggregate liability of Seller and the Members
to indemnify the Buyer Parties under _Article X_ shall not exceed the Share
Consideration, _plus_ , as of such time that there are any Excess Losses, the
Buyer Parties shall have the right to recoup all or any portion of any
Losses they shall suffer by notifying Seller that Buyer is reducing the
amount of any Earn-out Consideration otherwise payable by Buyer and Parent to
Seller following the Closing by the amount of any such Losses or the portion
thereof specified by the Buyer Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the aggregate liability of each Member to indemnify the Buyer
Parties from and against any Losses not subject to the limitation set forth in
the preceding sentence shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds
received by such Member hereunder.



 

\- 27 - (c) With respect to Losses arising under _Section 10.2(a)(ii)_, such Losses
shall be satisfied only by such Member individually, subject to the
limitations contained herein.

10.4 _Third Party Claims_.

(a) If subsequent to the Closing any third party shall notify any Person
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2_ hereof (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
which may give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the party or parties from which indemnification is
sought (which in the case of a claim against Members shall be satisfied by
notice to the Members Representative) (collectively, the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") promptly notice in writing of the Third Party Claim together with a
statement of any available information regarding such Third Party Claim,
provided that the failure to deliver such notice promptly shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of their obligations hereunder, except (and then only)
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party, within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has
given notice of the Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party that the
Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense against (or settlement of) such
Third Party Claim and will indemnify the Indemnified Party against such Third
Party Claim in its name or, if necessary, in the name of the Indemnified
Party in accordance with the terms and limitations of this _Article X_ and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim in
an active and diligent manner; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not
be entitled to assume the conduct and control of such defense (or, as
applicable, the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to cede the conduct and
control of such defense to Indemnified Party) if (A) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, criminal allegation or investigation or (B)
the Indemnified Party shall be advised in writing by counsel chosen by it that
there are one or more defenses available to the Indemnified Party which the
Indemnifying Party has not or cannot assert on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(in which case, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the conduct
and control of the proceeding to the limited extent solely necessary to
preserve and assert such defense on its behalf); provided further, that in
either such event, the Indemnifying Party may continue to participate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim at its own expense. In the event the
Indemnifying Party shall fail to give notice that such Indemnifying Party is
exercising its right to defend the Indemnified Party within the time and as
prescribed by _Section 10.4_ or is otherwise not permitted to assume the
defense of such claim in accordance with this _Section 10.4_, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct such defense at the
Indemnifying Partys cost and expense; provided that the Indemnified
Party shall be prohibited from compromising or settling the claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the event that the
Indemnifying Party does deliver notice prescribed in _Section 10.4_ and is
otherwise permitted to conduct the defense of the subject Third Party Claim in
accordance with this _Section 10.4_, the Indemnified Party will cooperate
with Indemnifying Party, all at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.
Regardless of which party defends such claim, the other party shall have the
right, at its expense, to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of
its own choosing.

(c) So long as the conditions set forth in _Section 10.4(b)_ are and remain
satisfied, then (i) the Indemnifying Party may conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section 10.4(b)_, (ii) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and (iii)
the  



 

\- 28 -  Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement, except that no consent shall be required if (1) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are entirely paid or reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party, (2) there is no finding or admission of any violation of
applicable law and (3) such settlement includes an unconditional release from
all liability with respect to such claim.

10.5 _Procedures Relating to Direct Indemnification Claims_. An Indemnified
Party seeking indemnification hereunder for a claim not involving a third
party shall, within the relevant limitation period provided for in this
Article X, (i) in the case of indemnification sought by any Buyer Party, give
to the Members Representative, or (ii) in the case of indemnification sought
by Seller, give to Buyer, written notice (a " _Direct Claim Notice_ ")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the indemnification
claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of
a Direct Claim Notice to (i) agree to the amount set forth in the Direct
Claim Notice and pay such amount to such Indemnified Party in immediately
available funds or (ii) provide such Indemnified Party with written notice
that it disputes its obligation to provide the indemnification sought in the
Direct Claim Notice (a " _Claim Dispute Notice_ "). If the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its
receipt of such notice that Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim, such claim specified in the
Direct Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a Claim Dispute Notice,
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve the matter. In the event that the controversy is not resolved
within twenty (20) days of the giving of the Claim Dispute Notice, the parties
thereafter may pursue any and all available remedies at law (subject to the
limitations and conditions provided in this Agreement).

10.6 _Manner of Payment_. With respect to each share of Share Consideration,
for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that the
restrictions set forth in the Restricted Stock Agreement no longer apply to
such share, the Share Consideration shall be subject to forfeiture to Parent
to satisfy amounts payable by the Members pursuant to _Article X_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent and the
Buyer each agree that for so long as all or a portion of the
Share Consideration has not been released to the Seller (or its Members) as
of a Release Date, the sole recourse of the Buyer Parties for indemnification
claims made by the Buyer Parties pursuant to _Section 10.2_ shall be to the
Share Consideration. For purposes of this _Article X_ , any shares of Share
Consideration used to satisfy Sellers and/or the Members indemnification
obligations shall be valued as set forth in _Section 3.2(c)(ii)_.
For obligations pursuant to this _Article X_ when the Share Consideration is
insufficient or unavailable to the Buyer Parties, subject to the following
sentence, Buyers sole recourse shall be to reduce the amount of the Earn-out
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.4_ in satisfaction of any such
Losses. Following exhaustion of amounts available to satisfy Losses in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 10.6_, the Buyer
Parties shall be permitted, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
10.3_, to pursue any additional Losses for which the Members are required to
indemnify the Buyer Parties under this _Article X_ directly against the
Members on a several basis in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests.

10.7 _Tax Treatment_. Any payments under Article X shall be treated by the
parties hereto for federal, state and local income tax purposes as a purchase
price adjustment, except to the extent that a contrary treatment is required
by applicable law. Any indemnification payment made under this Agreement
will take into account (i) any Tax benefit to the Indemnified Party resulting
from the Loss giving rise to such payment (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
such indemnification payment will only take such Tax benefit into account at
such time when the Tax benefit results in a reduction of cash taxes actually
paid or currently owed to a taxing authority) , net of any Tax cost to the
Indemnified Party from receipt of the indemnification payment (but only at
such time when the Tax cost results in an increase of  



 

\- 29 -  cash taxes actually paid or currently owed to a taxing authority), and (ii)
any net insurance proceeds (exclusive of deductible amounts, coinsurance
and self-insurance proceeds) or net reimbursement from any third party to the
extent actually collected by the Indemnified Party in compensation for the
same Loss with respect to which indemnification is sought. If an Indemnified
Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, from any
other third party with indemnification obligations or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification
payment by any Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made by such Indemnifying
Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the
amount received by the Indemnified Party.

10.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, the parties rights to
indemnification pursuant to this Article X shall, except for equitable relief
and specific performance of covenants that survive Closing and for claims
under _Section 3.3_, _Section 3.4_ and _Section 12.14_ of this Agreement,
be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the parties with respect to any
matter arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than for claims of fraud.

ARTICLE XI

in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _8.3(b)_ to be satisfied and (2) which is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured no later than the 30th day after written notice

(c) by the Buyer, if any of the representations and warranties of Seller or
of any Member contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct or

of Seller or the Members in this Agreement that, in any event, (1) would
result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or
_8.2(b)_ to be satisfied and (2) which is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured no later than the 30th day after written notice thereof is given by the
Buyer _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 11.1(c) _if the Buyer is in material breach of
this Agreement; or

(d) by either Buyer or Seller if the transactions contemplated hereby have
not been consummated within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement;
provided that neither Buyer nor Seller shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(d)_ if such Persons knowing or
willful breach of this Agreement has prevented or delayed the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

11.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Buyer or the Seller as provided above, the provisions of this Agreement
shall immediately become void and of no further force and effect (other
than this _Section 11.2_ and _Sections 12.2_ , _12.3_ , _12.4_ , _12.7_ ,
_12.8_ , _12.10_ and _12.11_ , which shall each survive the termination of
this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of any of Buyer,
Seller or the Members to one another, except for knowing or willful breaches
of this Agreement prior to the time of such termination.

writing executed by Seller and the Members, and (ii) any such amendment or

the Parties shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part

transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any Party without the
prior written consent of each of Parent and Seller (which consent shall not be

12.5 _Assignment_.

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, except that except as set forth in _Section 12.5(b)_,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned or delegated by Seller without the prior written
consent of Buyer; provided that following the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, upon dissolution or liquidation of Seller, Seller may assign
any ongoing rights and benefits under this Agreement to the Sellers Members;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any such assignment, the Members
Representative shall continue to act on behalf of the assignees in accordance
with _Section 12.15_ in the taking of any actions by or in the name of Seller
or such assignees pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer may assign in whole
or in part its rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement (including
the right to purchase the Purchased Assets and the obligation to assume the
Assumed Liabilities) and all other agreements, documents and instruments
executed and/or delivered in connection herewith to one or more of its
Affiliates, and Buyer  



 

\- 32 -  may, in its sole discretion, direct Seller to convey the Purchased Assets,
in whole or in part, to one or more of its Affiliates; provided that no
such assignment or direction shall relieve or release the named Buyer or
Parent from any of their obligations under this Agreement, whether required to
be paid or performed prior to or after the Closing.

12.6 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such
provision to any person or circumstance shall be held to be prohibited by or
invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law in any respect by a
court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective only to
the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality or unenforceability,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining
provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of
this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to
such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible. The
provisions of this _Section 12.6_ are in intended to be in addition to, and
shall not be interpreted to interfere with, limit or otherwise narrow the
scope of, _Section 9.4(c)_.

12.7 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this Agreement and
the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Any capitalized term used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto and not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning set forth in this Agreement.
The use of the word "including" herein shall mean "including without
limitation." The Parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty and
covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party
has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which such Party has not breached shall not detract
from or mitigate the fact that such Party is in breach of the first
representation, warranty or covenant.

12.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the schedules and
exhibits hereto, and the agreements and documents referred to herein contain
the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter in
any way.

12.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective
when one or more such counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties
and delivered to the other Party.

12.10 _Governing Law_. THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN ALL
QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND
ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SCHEDULES ATTACHED HERETO, AND THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THIS AGREEMENT, WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS (WHETHER OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE
APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

12.11 _No Strict Construction_. Notwithstanding the fact that this Agreement
has been drafted and prepared by one of the Parties, Buyer and Seller confirm
that they and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted
this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the Parties, and
the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen
by the Parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person.



 

\- 33 - 12.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action
instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to the
provisions set forth in _Section 12.10_ above), in addition to any other
remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.

12.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit
of the Parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing
herein expressed or implied (including _Section 9.1_), shall give or be
construed to give any Person, other than the Parties hereto and such permitted
assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

12.14 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the
provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction
in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets. Seller agrees to
indemnify Buyer against all liability, damage or expense that Buyer may suffer
due to the failure to so comply or to provide notice required by any such law.

12.15 _Members  Representative_.

(a) The Seller and the Members hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint the
Members Representative as their true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent
with full power of substitution to: (i) receive the payment of the
Purchase Price hereunder; (ii) do and perform each and every act and thing
necessary and requisite to be done on their behalf to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) accept on behalf of the
Seller and Members service of process and any notices required to be served
on Seller or any Member; (iv) execute on behalf of Seller or any Member any
amendment or waiver hereto; and (v) take all actions to be taken by the Seller
or Members under this Agreement, including to deliver notices to be served on
Buyer by any such party and to control the defense and settlement of any and
all claims for indemnification by any Buyer Parties against Seller or any
Members under _Article X_ of this Agreement. 

(b) Seller and each Member hereby agrees that: (i) in all matters in which
action by the Members Representative is required or permitted, the Members
Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the Seller and the Members,
notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among any of the Seller or any of
the Members, and any Buyer Party shall be entitled to rely on any and all
action taken by the Members Representative under this Agreement without any
liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the Seller or Members,
notwithstanding any knowledge on the part of any Buyer Party of any such
dispute or disagreement; (ii) notice to the Members Representative,
delivered in the manner provided in _Section 12.3_, shall be deemed to be
notice to Seller and all Members for the purposes of this Agreement; (iii) the
power and authority of the Members Representative, as described in this
Agreement, shall continue in full force until all rights and obligations of
the Seller and Members under this Agreement shall have terminated, expired or
been fully performed. 

(c) Seller and each Member agrees that, notwithstanding the foregoing, at the
request of Buyer, Seller or such Member shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby individually on
Sellers or such Members own behalf, and delivery of each and every document
required of Seller or such Member pursuant to the terms hereof.



 

\- 34 - (d) In the event that the Members Representative dies, becomes unable to
perform his or her responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position,
then a majority in Percentage Interests of the Members shall select another
representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted representative shall
be deemed to be the Members Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement and the documents delivered pursuant hereto.

* * * * * 



 

\- 35 - IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Asset Purchase
Agreement to be duly executed as of the date and year first written above.

RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT

This RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 1,
2008 (the " _Effective Date_ "), is entered into among FTI Consulting, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (" _FTI_ "), Schonbraun McCann Consulting Group, LLC, a
New Jersey limited liability company (the " _Seller_ "), and [ _
_], a member of Seller (the " _Investor_ "). 

RECITALS:

WHEREAS, this Agreement is entered into pursuant to that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2008 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "),
by and among Seller, FTI, FTI SMC Acquisition, LLC, a Maryland limited
liability company (the " _Buyer_ ") and the other individuals named therein;

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement provides for the sale by the Seller to Buyer,
and the purchase by Buyer from the Seller, of substantially all of the assets
of Seller for consideration consisting of cash and shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of FTI (the " _Common Stock_ ," and all such shares of
Common Stock to be issued by FTI pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are
hereafter collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ ");

WHEREAS, the Seller expects to transfer the Shares to its members in
accordance with the percentage interest of each such member set forth on 
_Schedule 1_ (the " _Share Consideration Percentage Interest_ ");

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement, the Shares
shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the Shares shall be held by FTI during the period of restriction as
set forth herein, and in connection therewith, Investor shall execute a stock
power in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Stock Power_ ") and
shall deliver the Stock Power to FTI at the Closing (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement); and

WHEREAS, the Investor has entered into an employment agreement with FTI on
the date of this Agreement (as such may be amended, modified or replaced, the
" _Employment Agreement_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1\. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Investor._ The
Investor acknowledges, represents, warrants and covenants as follows:

(a) The Investor is an accredited investor as that term is defined under
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "); (b) The Investor has full capacity, power and authority to enter into,
execute, deliver and perform his or her obligations under this Agreement and
to make the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement. The Investor understands that the tax treatment and consequences of
the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement
and the receipt by the Investor of Restricted Securities are complicated. The
Investor is not relying on any statement by or information from FTI or any of
its officers, directors, employees, legal counsel, agents, representatives or
affiliates as to tax treatment or consequences.

(c) As used herein, the term " _Restricted Securities_ " means, collectively,
all Shares (or any other equity securities of FTI) that are or may be issued
by FTI to the Investor or to Seller for or on behalf of the Investor pursuant
to this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or any securities that may be
paid as a dividend or otherwise distributed thereon or with respect thereto or
issued or delivered in exchange or substitution therefor. Neither the Seller
nor the Investor shall (i) sell, assign, transfer, exchange, pledge, encumber
or otherwise dispose of, or make any offer or agreement relating to, any of
the Restricted Securities and/or any option, right or other interest with
respect to any Restricted Securities that the Investor may acquire, except
for a transfer to the Investor and the other members of Seller in accordance
with their respective Share Consideration Percentage Interest and (ii)
establish any "put equivalent position" or any "call equivalent position"
with respect to any Restricted Securities (in each case within the meaning of
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder) or otherwise enter into any swap,
derivative security, short sale or other transaction or arrangement that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, any economic consequences of owning
any Restricted Securities, whether or not such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of Restricted Securities, other securities, cash or other
consideration (such limitations on dispositions of and relating to Restricted
Securities described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to
hereinafter as the " _Restrictions_ "), until the Restrictions with respect
to such Restricted Securities shall have lapsed in accordance with _Section
2_ hereof.

(d) Neither the Seller nor the Investor has any present plan or intention to
sell, transfer, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of, or to effect any
other transaction which results in a reduction in the risk of ownership of,
the Restricted Securities that the Seller and Investor may acquire, except for
a transfer to the Investor and other members of Seller in accordance with
their respective Share Consideration Percentage Interest.

(e) The Investor understands that the offer and issuance of Shares is intended
to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act, by virtue of Section
4(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, based in
part on the representations and warranties of the Investor contained herein,
and that no registration  



 

\- 2 -  statement relating to the issuance of Shares (or the Restricted Securities)
in connection with the Purchase Agreement has been or will be filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or any other U.S. or
non-U.S. jurisdiction.

(f) The Investor is acquiring the Restricted Securities solely for his or her
own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the resale or
distribution thereof. The Investor understands that, as disclosed herein, the
Restricted Securities will not be registered under the Securities Act and
therefore cannot be resold unless they are registered under the Securities Act
or an exemption from registration is available. The Investor, together with
his or her attorney, accountant, purchaser representative and/or tax advisor
(collectively, the " _Advisors_ "), has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of an investment in the Restricted Securities. The Investor has
not received any offering memorandum or other written materials from FTI or
any of its affiliates or representatives relating to the Restricted
Securities. The Investor, together with his or her Advisors, has had the
opportunity to ask questions of, and has received answers to the Investors
and his or her Advisors satisfaction from, FTI concerning FTI, the Restricted
Securities and other matters pertaining to an investment in the Restricted
Securities. Understanding that an investment in the Restricted Securities is
speculative, the Investor acknowledges that he or she has the financial
ability to bear the economic risk of his or her investment in the Restricted
Securities (including the possible loss of the entire investment in the
Restricted Securities), has adequate means for providing for his or her
current needs and personal contingencies and has no need now, and anticipates
no need in the foreseeable future, for liquidity with respect to the
investment in the Restricted Securities. The Investor has determined that an
investment in the Restricted Securities is a suitable investment for the
Investor and that the Investors overall commitment to investments that are
not readily marketable, including the contemplated investment in the
Restricted Securities, is not excessive in view of his or her net worth and
financial condition.

(g) The Investor acknowledges that no representations or warranties have been
made to the Investor in connection with the Purchase Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby other than those contained in the Purchase
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement).

(h) The Investor understands that, since the Restricted Securities have
not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state or foreign
securities laws, the economic risk of investment in the Shares must be borne
indefinitely by the Investor unless they are subsequently registered under the
Securities Act or unless an exemption from such registration is available.
There is no assurance that the Shares will ever be so registered in the
future. Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act (" _Rule 144_ "), governing
the possible disposition of the Shares, may not be available, and there is no
assurance that Rule 144 will be available in the future. There is no assurance
that there will be any market for resale of the Restricted Securities.

(i) The Investor further acknowledges, represents, agrees and is aware that:

(i) neither the SEC nor any other federal, state or foreign agency or
governmental authority has passed upon the Restricted Securities or made
any finding or determination as to the fairness of this investment;



 

\- 3 - (ii) there are substantial risks of loss of investment incidental to the
acquisition of the Restricted Securities; and

(iii) the representations, warranties, agreements, undertakings and
acknowledgments made by the Investor in this Agreement are made with the
intent that they be relied upon by FTI in determining the suitability of the
Investor as an acquiror of the Restricted Securities, and shall survive the
acquisition of the Restricted Securities. In addition, the
Investor undertakes to notify FTI immediately of any change or expected
change in any representation, warranty or other information relating to the
Investor set forth herein occurring or expected to occur prior to the
Effective Date.

(j) The Investor has not received or responded to a general solicitation or
general advertising used by FTI or any subsidiary of FTI, or their
respective representatives in connection with the offer or issuance of the
Restricted Securities to the Investor and is not relying on FTI or any
subsidiary of FTI or any of their respective officers, employees,
representatives or affiliates for legal, tax, economic or related advice in
connection with the acquisition of the Restricted Securities and any
transactions related thereto.

Section 2\. _Lapse of Restrictions; Voting and Dividends; Current Public
Information and Registration_.

(a) Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, exchange, pledge, encumbrance
or other disposition of any Restricted Securities prior to the lapse of the
Restrictions with respect thereto shall be void and of no effect, and FTI
shall have the right to disregard the same on its books and records and to
issue "stop transfer" orders with respect thereto to its transfer agent.

(b) Subject to _Section 2(c)_ hereof, the Restrictions shall lapse as to 25%
of the Restricted Securities as of the day following each of the second,
third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the Effective Date.1

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 2(b)_:

(i) in the event the Investors employment is terminated by the Employer
without Cause or by the Investor for Good Reason (as such terms are defined
in his or her Employment Agreement), there is a Change of Control (as defined
in his or her Employment Agreement) or the Investor dies or becomes Disabled
(as defined in his or her Employment Agreement), the Restrictions immediately
shall lapse in their entirety as to all of the Restricted Securities effective
as of the last day of employment, the date when the Investor dies or becomes
Disabled, or the date the Change of Control is publicly announced, as the
case may be;

 |

With respect to the two members that did not sign the Purchase Agreement, the
Restrictions shall lapse as to 25% of the Restricted Securities as of the day
following each of the second and third anniversary dates of the Effective Date
and shall lapse as to 50% of the Restricted Securities as of the day following
the fourth anniversary date of the Effective Date.  

---|--- 



 

\- 4 - (ii) in the event that the Investor breaches any restrictive covenant in
Section 9.4 of the Purchase Agreement or Sections 12, 13 or 14 of his or her
Employment Agreement, a "Forfeiture Event" (as defined hereafter) occurs, or
the Investor terminates his or her employment without Good Reason (as defined
in his or her Employment Agreement), any Restricted Securities as to which
the Restrictions have not lapsed shall continue thereafter to be subject to
the Restrictions for an additional three years through the day following the
third anniversary of the date that the Restrictions would have otherwise
lapsed and the "Stock Floor Guaranty" (as defined hereafter) pursuant to
subsection 2(e) below will be null and void and no longer apply to the
Restricted Securities.

(d) The Investor shall have the right to vote the Restricted Securities held
by such Investor and shall be entitled to receive any dividends that
are declared and payable with respect thereto before and after all
Restrictions lapse. The existence of the Restricted Securities will not affect
in any way the right or authority of FTI or the holders of FTIs voting
securities to make or authorize (i) any or all adjustments,
recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in FTIs capital structure
or its business; (ii) any merger or consolidation of FTIs capital structure
or its business; (iii) any merger or consolidation of FTI; (iv) any issue of
bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference equity interests ahead of or
affecting the Restricted Securities or the rights thereof; (v) the dissolution
or liquidation of FTI; (vi) any sale or transfer of all or any part of FTIs
assets or business; or (vii) any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of
a similar character or otherwise.

(e) Subject to _Section 2(c)(ii)_, if at the time the Restrictions lapse with
respect to any Restricted Securities (each such date, a " _Restriction
Termination Date_ "), the "fair market value" per Share (which for purposes
hereof, shall be deemed to be the closing price per share of FTIs Common
Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other principal
securities exchange on which shares of FTI Common Stock are then traded) on
the later of (i) the date on which the Restrictions lapse or are terminated,
and (ii) the date when such FTI Common Stock first becomes eligible for sale
under the Securities Act (without regard to Section 144(e) of the rules
promulgated thereto), or if the exchange is not open for trading on such date,
the next trading day of FTI Common Stock on which the exchange is open for
trading) is less than $ _ _1 per share (as proportionately
adjusted for stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits and other
adjustments from time to time affecting FTIs Common Stock), then FTI and
Buyer (jointly and severally) shall, within five (5) business days of such
applicable Restriction Termination Date, pay to the Investor a special cash
payment, in the amount determined by multiplying (i) the number of Shares of
the Restricted Securities with respect to which the Restrictions lapsed
at such time, and (ii) the difference between $ _ _2 (as adjusted
if necessary) and the "fair market value" per Share (the " _Stock Floor
Guaranty_ ").

\- 5 - Section 3\. _Legends._

(a) The Seller and Investor understand and agree that stop transfer
instructions will be given to the transfer agent for the Common Stock with
respect to certificates evidencing the Shares and that there will be placed
on the certificates evidencing the Shares a legend stating in substance:

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY
NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT (A) PURSUANT TO
AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (B) PURSUANT
TO AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

(b) All certificates evidencing Shares constituting Restricted Securities
shall bear an additional legend stating in substance:

THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY
THIS CERTIFICATE ARE RESTRICTED BY AND SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
A RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH WILL BE FURNISHED BY THE
CORPORATION WITHOUT CHARGE UPON THE REQUEST OF ANY STOCKHOLDER. ANY SUCH
REQUEST SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION.

Following the lapse or termination of the Restrictions in accordance with
_Section 2_, upon written request of the Investor, FTI shall promptly remove
or cause to be removed the legend set forth in this _Section 3(b)_, provided
such removal is allowed under Rule 144 of the Securities Act and FTI has
received applicable information relating to the Investors compliance with
Rule 144. 

Section 4\. _Employment Rights._ To the extent that the Investor is employed
by FTI or any of its affiliates, no provision of this Agreement or of any
Restricted Securities governed hereby shall give the Investor any right to
continue in the employ of FTI or any of its affiliates, create any inference
as to the length of employment of the Investor, affect the right of FTI or of
its affiliates to terminate the employment of the Investor, with or without
cause, in accordance with the terms of his or her Employment Agreement or give
the Investor any right to participate in any employee welfare or benefit plan
or other program of FTI or any of its affiliates.

Section 5\. _Forfeiture Event_. A " _Forfeiture Event_ " shall be deemed
to have occurred if the Investor, directly or indirectly, (i) becomes
employed by, serves as a consultant or advisor to, becomes a partner or member
in, or otherwise engages or participate in, any enterprise engaging in or
participating in, a business comparable with,  



 

\- 6 -  related to and competitive with the financial advisory and consulting
services in the real estate industry, including, but not limited to,
valuation services, lease consulting and cost segregation services, conducted
by the Company, including any service offering introduced following Closing
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement) through the last date that Investor
remains an employee of Buyer or its affiliates (a " _Competing Business_ "),
(ii) solicits clients or employees of the Company for the benefit of a
Competing Business, (iii) willfully or deliberately discloses or uses
Confidential Information (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) in violation
of Section 9.4 of the Purchase Agreement or (iv) breaches or violates the
terms of any nonsolicitation, noncompetition or confidentiality provisions in
Investors Employment Agreement with FTI (or one of its affiliates). The
consequences of a Forfeiture Event occurring in relation to the Investor are
as follows: (a) the period to which the Restrictions apply to the Restricted
Securities (other than Restricted Securities for which the Restrictions shall
have lapsed) shall extend pursuant to _Section 2(c)(ii)_ of this Agreement
and (b) the Stock Floor Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force
and effect for Restricted Securities for which the Restrictions remain
applicable.

Section 6\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given
(i) upon receipt or refusal to accept delivery, if sent by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, (ii) one (1)

nationwide overnight courier service, or (iii) on the date it is sent by

Section 7\. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to the other.

Section 8\. _Binding Agreement._ This Agreement will inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon and enforceable against the parties and their successors
and assigns, including administrators, executors, representatives, heirs,
legatees and devisees of the Investor and any pledgee holding Restricted
Securities as collateral.



 

\- 7 - Section 9\. _Waiver._ No waiver by either party hereto of any condition or of
any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in
writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is
sought. No delay or omission by FTI in exercising any of its rights under this
Agreement will operate as a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver or
consent given by FTI on any one occasion is effective only in that instance
and will not be construed as a bar to, or waiver of, any right on any other
occasion.

Section 10\. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be construed and enforced
in accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by, the
laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to provisions thereof
regarding conflict of laws.

Section 11\. _Injunctive Relief._ The restrictions set forth in this Agreement
are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of FTI, Buyer
and/or their respective affiliates and are considered by the Investor to be
reasonable for such purpose. The Investor agrees that any breach by the
Investor of any term set forth under this Agreement is likely to cause FTI,
Buyer and/or their respective affiliates substantial and irrevocable damage
and, therefore, any such breach shall entitle FTI, Buyer and/or their
respective affiliates in addition to any other legal remedies available to any
of them, to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin such
breach or threatened breach or alleged breach or alleged threatened breach.
The parties hereto understand and intend that each restriction set forth
herein shall be construed as separable and divisible from every other
restriction, and that the unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any
restriction will not affect the enforceability of the remaining restrictions
and that one or more or all of such restrictions may be enforced in whole or
in part as the circumstances warrant. The Investor hereby acknowledges that
he or she is fully cognizant of the restrictions imposed upon his or her
Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Section 12\. _Titles; Section References._ The subject headings and
subheadings set forth in the sections and subsections of this Agreement
are included for purposes of convenience only and shall not affect the
construction or interpretation of any of its provisions. Unless the context
requires otherwise, all references herein to Sections are to Sections in this
Agreement.

Section 13\. _Rule of Construction; Definitions._ It is not intended by the
parties hereto that this Agreement shall be construed against the party that
has drafted all or any portion of this Agreement.

Section 14\. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the documents expressly
referred to herein, including the Purchase Agreement and the Employment
Agreement, embody the complete agreement and understanding between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede and
preempt any prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements or
representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof and thereof in any way.



 

\- 8 - Section 15\. _Severability._ Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, in
any respect, such invalidity shall not affect the validity, legality and
enforceability of any other provision or any other jurisdiction and, the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby, all of which shall remain in full force and
effect, and the affected term or provision shall be modified to the minimum
extent permitted by law so as to achieve most fully the intention of this
Agreement.
