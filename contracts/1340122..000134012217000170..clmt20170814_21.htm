ARTICLE II

Section 2.1Purchase and Sale of the Interests. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Buyer free and clear of any Liens (other than (a)
restrictions on transfer under applicable securities Laws and (b) Liens
created by or resulting from the acts of Buyer), and Buyer shall purchase and
acquire from Seller, all of the Interests in exchange for $435,000,000 (the
"Base Consideration"), as adjusted for Net Working Capital pursuant to Section
2.3, for Inventory pursuant to Section 2.4 and Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures pursuant to Section 2.5. Schedule 2.1 contains a representative
Pre-Closing Statement assuming that the Closing occurred on June 30, 2017,
which is included herein solely for purposes of identifying and describing the
categories and items to be reflected in the Pre-Closing Statement, and such
representative Pre-Closing Statement shall not be utilized for any other
purpose, including for purposes of identifying the principles, methods and
practices utilized in arriving at the values and amounts contained therein.



Section 2.2Calculation and Payment of Closing Payment.



(a)Calculation of Closing Payment. The term "Closing Payment" means an amount
(without duplication) equal to: (i) the Base Consideration, plus (ii) the
Estimated Net Working Capital, plus (iii) the Estimated Inventory, plus (iv)
the Estimated Reimbursable Capital Expenditures.



(b)Payment of Closing Payment. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to Seller at the Closing an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the Closing Payment.



(c)Pre-Closing Statement. Not fewer than five Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written statement
(the "Pre-Closing Statement"), setting forth Seller's good faith estimates, as
of the Closing Date, of (i) Net Working Capital, which estimate shall be
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Rules (such estimated amount being
the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), (ii) Reimbursable Capital Expenditures
(such estimated amount being the "Estimated Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures") and (iii) the Inventory amount (together with Seller's
estimates of the ownership, types, characteristics and volumes, on a tank,
trunk, pipeline or other location basis, of the Inventory, which estimates
shall be sufficiently detailed to allow Buyer to identify each item of
Inventory included in such estimate) and the estimated value thereof in
accordance with Section 2.4(a) (such estimated amount and estimated value
being the "Estimated Inventory"), together with reasonable supporting
documentation for such estimates. Buyer shall be entitled to promptly provide,
and Seller shall consider in good faith, Buyer's comments to the Pre-Closing
Statement; provided, however, that Seller shall make the final determination,
in its sole discretion, as to the contents of (including calculations and
estimations within) the Pre-Closing Statement for purposes of the Closing.





Section 2.3Purchase Price Adjustment-Net Working Capital.



(a)Closing Statement. Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a written statement (the "Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement"), which shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Rules, setting forth Buyer's good faith determination of the actual
Net Working Capital, as of the Closing Date, together with reasonable
supporting documentation for such calculations. Following delivery of the
Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement, Buyer shall promptly provide
Seller with any additional information reasonably requested by Seller
supporting the calculations contained in the Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Statement. After receipt of the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement,
Seller shall have 30 days (the "Review Period") to review the Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Seller and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to the books and records of the
Company, the financial personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Buyer and/or
Buyer's representatives to the extent that they relate to the Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement (provided, that Sellers and its representatives
execute a customary independent accountant access letter if requested by
Buyer's independent accountants) and to such historical financial information
relating to the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement as Seller may
reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Post-Closing Net Working
Capital Statement and preparing an Objections Statement; provided, however,
that such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal business operations of Buyer or the Company.



(b)Objections Statement. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written statement either accepting the Post-
Closing Net Working Capital Statement or specifying any objections thereto in
reasonable detail (an "Objections Statement"). If Seller does not deliver an
Objections Statement on or prior to such date, then the Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement shall become final and binding upon all Parties. If
Seller delivers an Objections Statement on or prior to such date, then Seller
and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith for 15 days following Buyer's receipt
of such Objections Statement to resolve Seller's objections. Any such
objection that Buyer and Seller is unable to resolve during such 15-day period
is referred to as a "Working Capital Dispute." After such 15-day period, any
matter set forth in the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement that is not
a Working Capital Dispute shall become final and binding upon all Parties. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all objections during such 15-day
period, then any Working Capital Disputes, and only such Working Capital
Disputes, shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm for final resolution in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.8. Upon delivery of such
resolution, the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement, as modified in
accordance with such resolution and any other mutual resolutions of the
Parties, shall become final and binding upon all Parties. The Net Working
Capital amount set forth on the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement as
finally determined in accordance with this Article II shall constitute the
"Final Net Working Capital".





(c)Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount is positive, then Buyer shall, within five
Business Days following the determination of the Post-Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by Seller in writing) an amount equal to the Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
is negative, then Seller shall, within five Business Days following the
determination of the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, pay,
or cause to be paid, to Buyer (by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated by Buyer in writing) an amount equal to
the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. All payments made
pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) shall be treated as adjustments to the
purchase price paid for the Interests for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.



Section 2.4Purchase Price Adjustment - Inventory; Measurement and Valuation of
Inventory.



(a)Volumes and quantities of Inventory (including Hydrocarbon Inventory and
Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory) and the valuation thereof for purposes of
calculating the Estimated Inventory for inclusion in the Pre-Closing
Statement, shall be based on the good faith estimates of Seller of such
volumes and quantities and values as of the Closing Date and valued in
accordance with the valuation methodologies and procedures set forth in
Schedule 2.4 (but without any requirement of conducting a physical inventory
or measurement prior to execution of this Agreement). The actual volumes and
quantities of Inventory (including Hydrocarbon Inventory and Non-Hydrocarbon
Inventory), for purposes of calculating the Inventory amount and valuation
thereof for inclusion in the Post-Closing Inventory Statement, shall be
determined in accordance with this Section 2.4 and the measurement and
valuation methodologies and procedures set forth in Schedule 2.4; provided,
that Buyer shall disclose to Seller in accordance with Schedule 2.4 the
existence of any Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory (x) that is not identified on the
Pre-Closing Statement and (y) that Buyer or its Affiliates identify or become
aware of prior to the earlier of the date on which Seller delivers any
Inventory Objections Statement or the date on which the Post-Closing Inventory
Statement becomes final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with
Section 2.4(b), it being agreed that Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no
affirmative obligation to investigate whether any such Non-Hydrocarbon
Inventory exists.



(b)Within 20 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a written statement (the "Post-Closing Inventory Statement") setting
forth Buyer's good faith determination of the measurement of the actual Non-
Hydrocarbon Inventory and the valuation of actual Inventory, as of the Closing
Date ("Final Inventory") determined in accordance with the measurement and
valuation methodologies set forth in Schedule 2.4, accompanied by the
petroleum inspection company's report referenced in Schedule 2.4 and other
reasonable supporting documentation for such calculations. No later than 30
days after its receipt of the Post-Closing Inventory Statement, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a written statement either accepting the Post-Closing
Inventory Statement or specifying any objections thereto in reasonable detail
(an "Inventory Objections Statement"); provided, that the petroleum inspection
company's report shall govern with respect to the measurement of volumes
absent manifest error in the calculation thereof. If Seller does not deliver
an Inventory Objections Statement within such 30-day period, then the Post-
Closing Inventory Statement shall become final and binding upon all Parties.
If Seller delivers an Inventory Objections Statement on or prior to such date,
then Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith for 15 days following
Buyer's receipt of such Inventory Objections Statement to resolve Seller's
objections. Any such objection that Buyer and Seller is unable to resolve
during such 15-day period is referred to as an "Inventory Dispute." After such
15-day period, any matter set forth in the Post-Closing Inventory Statement
that is not an Inventory Dispute shall become final and binding upon all
Parties. If Buyer and Seller are



unable to resolve all objections during such 15-day period, then any Inventory
Disputes, and only such Inventory Disputes, shall be submitted to the
Accounting Firm for a final resolution in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 2.8. Upon delivery of such resolution, the Post-Closing
Inventory Statement, as modified in accordance with such resolution and any
other mutual resolutions of the Parties, shall become final and binding upon
all Parties.



(c)If the Post-Closing Inventory Adjustment Amount is positive, then Buyer
shall, within five Business Days following the determination of the Post-
Closing Inventory Adjustment Amount, pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Seller in writing) an amount equal to the Post-Closing Inventory
Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Inventory Adjustment Amount is
negative, then Seller shall, within five Business Days following the
determination of the Post-Closing Inventory Adjustment Amount, pay, or cause
to be paid, to Buyer (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by Buyer in writing) an amount equal to the
Post-Closing Inventory Adjustment Amount. All payments made pursuant to this
Section 2.4(c) shall be treated as adjustments to the purchase price paid for
the Interests for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.



Section 2.5Purchase Price Adjustment - Reimbursable Capital Expenditures.



(a)The actual Reimbursable Capital Expenditures incurred or paid by Seller as
of the Closing Date shall be used to determine the final Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures (the "Final Reimbursable Capital Expenditures").



(b)Within 20 days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver
to Buyer a written statement (the "Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures Statement") reflecting the actual Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures as of the Closing Date, as supported by invoices from contractors
and service providers and the Company's and/or Seller's or its Affiliates'
payment records. Following delivery of the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures Statement, Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with any
additional information reasonably requested by Buyer supporting the
calculations contained in the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital Expenditures
Statement. After its receipt of the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures Statement, Buyer shall have 30 days to review the Post-Closing
Reimbursable Capital Expenditures Statement (the "Capex Review Period").
During the Capex Review Period, Buyer and its representatives shall have
reasonable access to the books and records of Seller, the personnel of, and
work papers prepared by, Seller and/or Seller's representatives to the extent
that they relate to the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital Expenditures
Statement and to such historical information relating to the Post-Closing
Reimbursable Capital Expenditures Statement as Buyer may reasonably request
for the purpose of reviewing the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures Statement and preparing a Capex Objections Statement; provided,
however, that such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of Seller.





(c)On or prior to the last day of the Capex Review Period, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller a written statement either accepting the Post-Closing Reimbursable
Capital Expenditures Statement or specifying any objections thereto in
reasonable detail (a "Capex Objections Statement"). If Buyer does not deliver
a Capex Objections Statement on or prior to such date, then the Post-Closing
Reimbursable Capital Expenditures Statement shall become final and binding
upon all Parties. If Buyer delivers a Capex Objections Statement on or prior
to such date, then Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith for 15 days
following Seller's receipt of such Capex Objections Statement to resolve
Buyer's objections. Any such objection that Buyer and Seller is unable to
resolve during such 15-day period is referred to as a "Capex Dispute." After
such 15-day period, any matter set forth in the Post-Closing Reimbursable
Capital Expenditures Statement that is not a Capex Dispute shall become final
and binding upon all Parties. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all
objections during such 15-day period, then any Capex Disputes, and only such
Capex Disputes, shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm for a final
resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.8. Upon
delivery of such resolution, the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures Statement, as modified in accordance with such resolution and any
other mutual resolutions of the Parties, shall become final and binding upon
all Parties.



(d)If the Final Reimbursable Capital Expenditures is greater than the
Estimated Reimbursable Capital Expenditures, then Buyer shall, within five
Business Days following the determination of the Post-Closing Reimbursable
Capital Expenditures Adjustment Amount, pay or cause to be paid to Seller (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Seller in writing) an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Reimbursable Capital Expenditures Adjustment Amount. If the Estimated
Reimbursable Capital Expenditures is greater than the Final Reimbursable
Capital Expenditures, then Seller shall, within five Business Days following
the determination of the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital Expenditures
Adjustment Amount, pay or cause to be paid to Buyer (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by Buyer in
writing) an amount equal to the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital Expenditures
Adjustment Amount. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.5(d) shall be
treated as adjustments to the purchase price paid for the Interests for all
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.



Section 2.6Tax Allocation.



(a)No later than 30 days after the resolution of the Final Net Working
Capital, Buyer shall provide a schedule to Seller setting forth in reasonable
detail an allocation of the purchase price among the assets of the Company in
a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (such allocation shall be the "Draft Allocation").



(b)Within 30 days after the receipt of the Draft Allocation, Seller shall
provide notice to Buyer of any dispute as to the Draft Allocation (or any
portion thereof). If Seller timely disputes the Draft Allocation (or any
portion thereof), Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
the dispute. If Seller does not timely dispute the Draft Allocation (or any
portion thereof), the Draft Allocation shall be final and binding on the
Parties and if Seller timely disputes the Draft Allocation and Seller and
Buyer resolve such dispute within 15 days following Seller's notice of
dispute, the Draft Allocation (as appropriately adjusted to reflect any final
resolution of the dispute) shall be final and binding on the Parties (any
final and binding allocation under this shall be referred to as the "Final
Allocation").







(c)In the event there is a Final Allocation and there is an adjustment to the
purchase price after the Final Allocation has been determined, Seller and
Buyer shall make appropriate adjustments in accordance with the Final
Allocation to reflect such adjustment (the "Revised Allocation").



(d)Buyer and Seller agree to file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594 and
any amended Tax Returns or claims for refund) in a manner consistent with the
any Final Allocation (subject to necessary adjustments to reflect a Revised
Allocation) and neither Buyer nor Seller will take any position inconsistent
with such allocation on any Tax Return or otherwise, unless required to do so
by applicable Law or a final "determination," within the meaning of Section
1313(a)(1) of the Code (or similar provision of state or local Law); provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Seller or Buyer, after a
good faith defense, from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the Final Allocation or
any Revised Allocation and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority challenging the Final Allocation or Revised Allocation,
as applicable. Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other in
writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or
assessment challenging to how the purchase price is allocated among the assets
of the Company.



(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the due date of a Tax Return to
be filed after the Closing Date there is not a Final Allocation, Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, shall be entitled to take any good faith position
with respect to all unresolved items as to the allocation of the purchase
price on such Tax Return to be filed, and if on or prior to the February 10,
2018, there is not a Final Allocation, each of the Buyer and Seller shall be
entitled to take any good faith position with respect to all unresolved items
as to the allocation of the purchase price on any Tax Return to be filed after
February 10, 2018.



Section 2.7Withholding. Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the amounts payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or applicable Law;
provided, however, that Buyer and Seller currently anticipate that so long as
an appropriate FIRPTA certification is provided pursuant to Section
3.2(a)(iv), as of the date hereof, no withholding should be required under
this Agreement. To the extent that Buyer concludes that withholding under this
Agreement is required, then promptly following such conclusion, Buyer shall
inform Seller of such conclusion, and the parties shall work in good faith to
minimize or eliminate any such withholding obligations. If withholding is
ultimately required pursuant to this Section 2.7, to the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld by Buyer or the Company, such deducted and
withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by Buyer or the Company to the
applicable Governmental Authority within the time and in the manner required
by applicable Law and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Dispute Resolution.





(a)If any Working Capital Dispute, Inventory Dispute or Capex Dispute cannot
be resolved within the time periods prescribed in Section 2.3, Section 2.4 or
Section 2.5, as applicable, such Disputes shall be submitted to and resolved
by PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if PricewaterhouseCoopers is not available for
such assignment, another nationally recognized accounting firm upon which
Buyer and Seller shall reasonably agree (the "Accounting Firm"). Buyer and
Seller shall each promptly execute a customary engagement letter with respect
to the engagement of the Accounting Firm. Each Party shall (i) cooperate with
the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the opportunity to make presentations and
provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in defense of its
positions, (iii) subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity
agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their respective books,
records, personnel and representatives, and such other information as the
Accounting Firm may require in order to render its determination and (iv) not
engage in ex parte communications with the Accounting Firm. The Accounting
Firm shall be instructed to resolve any Disputes in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement within 30 days after its engagement (or such other time as
the Parties shall agree in writing).



(b)The resolution of such Disputes by the Accounting Firm (i) shall be set
forth in writing, (ii) may not assign a value greater than the greatest value
or smaller than the smallest value for each Dispute claimed by either Seller
or Buyer, (iii) shall be based solely on written submissions and presentations
by Buyer and Seller and not on independent review, (iv) shall constitute an
arbitral award, and (v) shall be conclusive and binding upon all the Parties
upon which a judgment may be rendered by a court having proper jurisdiction
over the Party against which such determination is sought to be enforced.



(c)The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage of the contested amount submitted to the Accounting Firm that is
ultimately awarded to each Party such that each Party bears a percentage of
such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount
awarded to the other Party. For example, if Seller claims an amount is $1,000
greater than the amount determined by Buyer, and Buyer contests only $500 of
the amount claimed by Seller, and the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the
Dispute by awarding Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the Accounting
Firm's costs and expenses shall be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and
40% (i.e., 200/500) to Seller.



Section 2.9Certain Post-Closing Adjustments. The Parties hereby agree to the
procedures set forth on Schedule 2.9 with respect to certain potential
payments to be made after the Closing.

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Indiana
and (b) is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing, or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification (except, in the case of clause (b), where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, materially delay, or
materially impair, the consummation of the Transactions).



Section 4.2Due Authorization. Seller has all requisite limited partnership
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each
Transaction Document to which it is, or will be as of the Closing, a party and

the consummation of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized and
approved by the Board of Directors of Seller, and



no other proceeding, consent or authorization on the part of Seller is
necessary to authorize any Transaction Document to which Seller is, or will be
as of the Closing, a party. Each Transaction Document to which Seller is, or
will be as of the Closing, a party has been or will be duly and validly
executed and delivered by Seller, and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto, constitutes, or
will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable
against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions.



Section 4.3No Conflict. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.3, the execution and
delivery by Seller of each Transaction Document to which Seller is, or will be
as of the Closing, a party, the performance by Seller of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the Transactions by Seller do
not and will not:



(a)assuming compliance with the matters addressed in Section 4.4, breach,
violate or conflict with any applicable Law or Order binding upon or
applicable to Seller;



(b)breach, violate, conflict with or result in a default under any provision
of, or constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
result in a breach, violation of or default under any Material Contract or
Permit to which Seller is a party or by which its assets or properties are
bound;



(c)violate or conflict with the Organizational Documents of Seller; or



(d)result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on the Interests;

except, in the cases of clauses (a) and (b), any such breach, violation,
termination, conflict or default that would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of Seller to enter into this
Agreement or consummate the Transactions.

Section 4.4No Authorization or Consents Required. No notice to, consent,

conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified and is in good standing
as a foreign entity in all jurisdictions in which it is required to be so
licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The only business activity that has been carried on
or is currently carried on by the Company is the operation, maintenance and
ownership of the Refinery (and related properties and assets) and any other
activity that is incidental or related thereto and to the Business.



(b)Seller has made available to Buyer true and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents of the Company, as amended to the date hereof.

or thereunder do not and will not:



(a)breach, violate, conflict with or result in a default under any provision
of, or constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
result in a breach, violation of or default under any Material Contract or
Permit to which the Company is a party or by which the Company's assets or
properties are bound;

conflict or default that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.3Litigation; Orders. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3, (a) there
are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing,
before or by any Governmental Authority or by any other Person against the
Company or any of its assets or properties that could reasonably be expected
to result in the Company being obligated to pay an amount in excess of
$250,000 or is an Action for injunctive or equitable relief or other similar
remedy and (b) the Company is not subject to any material outstanding Order.
To the Knowledge of Seller, no written notice has been received by Seller or
the Company in relation to any material Action by or before any Governmental
Authority.



Section 5.4Capitalization. Other than the Interests, there is no other Equity
Interest of the Company authorized, issued or reserved for issuance or
outstanding. The Interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid (to
the extent required by the Organizational Documents of the Company) and non-
assessable (except as such non-assessability may be affected by Sections
18-607 and 18-804 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act to the extent
such concepts are applicable). There are no outstanding or authorized stock
appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or similar rights with
respect to the Company. The Company has no authorized or outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness the holders of which have the right to
vote (or are convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to
subscribe for or acquire securities having the right to vote) with the
Interests on any matter. No Person has any right of first offer, right of
first refusal or preemptive right in connection with any future offer, sale or
issuance of Equity Interest of the Company. Neither Seller nor the Company is
subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase or otherwise
acquire or retire the Interests.

of any Person, and the Company is not obligated to make any investment in or
capital contribution to any Person.



Section 5.6Financial Statements.

results of operations and cash flow statements being collectively, the

30, 2017 (the "June Balance Sheet"), and results of operations and cash flow

and the absence of complete notes, the effect of which would not be materially
adverse) and (iii) were compiled from the books and records of the Company
regularly maintained by management and used to prepare the financial
statements of the Company in accordance with



GAAP, without modification of the accounting principles used in the
preparation thereof throughout the periods presented, except as required by

such policies are valid and binding and in full force and effect, (b) Seller
has not received any written notice disclaiming coverage, reserving rights
with respect to a particular claim or such policy in general, or canceling,

under any of the Seller Insurance Policies with respect to the Company or the

to which the Company is subject. To the Knowledge of Seller, the Company is
not under investigation by a Governmental Authority with respect to the
material violation of any Laws.



Section 5.18Company Environmental Matters. Except as set forth on Schedule
5.18:



(a)The Company is, and has in the last three years prior to the date hereof
been, in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
Environmental Laws and the Consent Decree.

all material respects, with all Environmental Permits necessary for the

information, citation, summons or Order has been received, and no Action is
pending or threatened in writing or, to the Knowledge of Seller, otherwise
threatened, by any Person with respect to the Company or the Business, in each
case the subject of which remains unresolved and which could reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability under Environmental Law.



(d)To the Knowledge of Seller, the Company has not Released any Hazardous
Material at any Company Property in violation of any Environmental Law or for
which there is any material obligation or Liability of the Company under
Environmental Law to perform any investigation or remedial action, the subject
of which remains unresolved.



(e)To the Knowledge of Seller, the Company has not disposed of, transported or
arranged for the disposal or transportation of Hazardous Materials at or to a
site, or owned leased or operated a site, that, pursuant to CERCLA or any
similar or analogous state law, has been placed or is proposed to be placed by
the EPA or similar state authority on the National Priorities List or similar
state list, as in effect as of the Closing Date.





The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 5.18 constitute
the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Seller with respect
to Environmental Laws, Environmental Permits, Hazardous Materials and other
environmental-related matters in connection with the Transactions, and no
other provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a representation or
warranty with respect to such matters.

Section 5.19Permits. The Company possesses all of the material Permits (other
than Environmental Permits, which are addressed in Section 5.18) necessary to
permit the Company to own, operate, use and maintain its assets in the manner
in which they are now owned, operated, used and maintained and to conduct the
Business (the "Company Permits"), each of which has been provided or made
available to Buyer (including all amendments thereto) and is listed in
Schedule 5.19. Each Company Permit is valid and in full force and effect and
there are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, that
could reasonably be expected to result in the termination, revocation,
suspension or restriction of any Company Permit. The Company is in compliance
in all respects with the Company Permits, except where failure to be in such
compliance would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 5.20Bank Accounts; Managers and Officers. Schedule 5.20 contains a
true, correct and complete list of (a) the names and locations of all banks,
trust companies and other financial institutions at which the Company
maintains accounts of any nature or safe deposit boxes and lists the
respective signatories therefor and (b) the managers and officers of the
Company. No person holds a power of attorney to act on behalf of the Company.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER



Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the

hereof (or such earlier date as is specified below) and as of the Closing
Date, that:

Section 6.1Corporate Organization. Buyer (a) is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware and (b) is qualified to do business and is in good standing
as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing, or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification (except, in the case of clause (b), where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, materially delay, or
materially impair, the consummation of the Transactions).



Section 6.2Due Authorization. Buyer has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each
Transaction Document to which it is, or will be as of the Closing, a party,
and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery by Buyer of
each Transaction Document to which it is, or will be as of the Closing, a
party, and the consummation of the Transactions has been duly and validly
authorized and approved by the Board of Directors of Buyer, and no other
proceeding, consent or authorization on the part of Buyer is necessary to
authorize any Transaction Document to which Buyer is, or will be as of the
Closing, a party. Each Transaction Document to which Buyer is, or will be as
of the Closing, a party, has been or will be duly and validly executed and
delivered by Buyer and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
thereof by the other parties thereto,



constitutes, or will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer, enforceable against Buyer, in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.



Section 6.3No Conflict. The execution and delivery by Buyer of each
Transaction Document to which Buyer is, or will be, as of the Closing, a
party, the performance by Buyer of its obligations hereunder and thereunder
and the consummation of the Transactions by Buyer do not and will not:



(a)breach, violate, conflict with or result in a default under any provision
of, or constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
result in a breach or violation of or conflict or default under any Contract
to which Buyer is a party or by which any of Buyer's assets or properties are
bound;



(b)assuming compliance with the matters addressed in Section 6.4, breach,
violate or conflict with any applicable Law or Order binding upon or
applicable to Buyer; or



(c)violate or conflict with the Organizational Documents of Buyer;

except, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), any such breach, violation,
conflict or default that has not had any effect, event, occurrence,
circumstance or development that materially impairs or materially delays the
ability of Buyer to consummate the Transactions.

Section 6.4No Authorization or Consents Required. No notice to, consent,
approval or authorization of or designation, declaration or filing with any
Governmental Authority or other Person is required by Buyer with respect to
Buyer's execution or delivery of any Transaction Document to which Buyer, is
or will be a party or the consummation of the Transactions, except the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals.



Section 6.5Litigation; Orders. There are no Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing before or by any Governmental
Authority against Buyer or to which Buyer is otherwise a party or any assets
of Buyer are subject that (a) challenge the validity or enforceability of
Buyer's obligations under any Transaction Document or (b) seek to prevent or
delay, or otherwise would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Buyer to enter into this Agreement or consummate the
Transactions. Buyer is not subject to any outstanding Order that prohibits or
otherwise has a material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate
the Transactions.



Section 6.6Sufficient Funds. Buyer will have available at the Closing
sufficient cash on hand or other sources of immediately available funds to
meet all of its obligations under this Agreement (including, but not limited
to, the Closing Payment, any and all other amounts required to be paid by
Buyer in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and all of
Buyer's fees and expenses incurred in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Buyer has not incurred any obligation,
commitment, restriction or Liability of any kind, and is not contemplating or
aware of any obligation, commitment, restriction or Liability of any kind, in
any case which would materially impair or materially adversely affect such
funding.





Section 6.7Brokers. Except for the fees, costs and expenses set forth on
Schedule 6.7, for which Buyer is responsible, there are no claims for
brokerage, finders' or other advisory fees, costs, expenses, commissions or
other similar payments in connection with the execution and delivery of the
Transaction Documents or the consummation of the Transactions based on any
Contract made by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates that Seller or
any of its Affiliates may be obligated to pay.



Section 6.8Investment Purpose. Buyer is acquiring the Interests solely for its
own account for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any resale or other distribution thereof. Buyer
acknowledges that the Interests are not registered under the Securities Act or
any state securities laws, and that the Interests may not be transferred or
sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act or
pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and subject to state securities
laws and regulations, as applicable. Buyer is able to bear the economic risk
of holding the Interests for an indefinite period (including total loss of its
investment), and has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its
investment.



Section 6.9Investigation. Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser,
and has engaged expert advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of
assets and businesses similar to the Business as contemplated hereunder. Buyer
has undertaken an independent investigation to enable it to make an informed
and intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement.

Section 7.2Access to Information.



(a)During the Interim Period, Seller shall cause the Company to (i) provide
Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors, employees, officers, Affiliates,
auditors and other representatives reasonable access to the offices,
properties, assets, Contracts, books and records and other documents and data
of or related to the Company; (ii) furnish to Buyer, its counsel, financial

such information in Seller's or the Company's possession relating to the

reasonable prior written notice to Seller and (B) be under the supervision of
Seller's personnel and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with
the normal operations of Seller and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, without the prior written
consent of Seller, Buyer shall have no right of access to, and Seller shall
have no obligation to disclose to Buyer, any information the disclosure of
which would (w) cause or result in significant competitive harm to Seller, its
Affiliates, the Company or their respective businesses if the Transactions are
not consummated; (x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege
available to Seller, its Affiliates or the Company, (y) cause Seller or the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates to breach a confidentiality

borings, geoprobes, test pits or monitoring wells, of any Real Property or
other assets of the Company. Buyer's right to conduct any such testing or
sampling on any Leased Real Property during the Interim Period shall also be
subject to Seller obtaining any consent required from any applicable lessor if

representatives to, in connection with the conduct of any such permitted
testing or sampling during the Interim Period conducted in connection with the

(c)During the Interim Period, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to keep the other Party apprised on a reasonably current basis of the
status of matters relating to completion of the Transactions, including
promptly notifying in writing the other Party of any development or
combination of developments that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair such
Party's ability to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party shall give written notice to the other Party promptly
upon becoming aware of any fact, change, condition, event, occurrence or non-
occurrence that, if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date,
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Article X (in the case
of Seller) or Article IX (in the case of Buyer) or the institution of, or the
threat of institution of, any Action against such Party relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions.



(d)None of Seller, the Company or any of their respective representatives
makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information
provided pursuant to this Section 7.2, and Buyer may not rely on the accuracy
of any such information, in each case other than as expressly set forth in the
representations and warranties contained in Article IV or Article V or in any
other Transaction Document. Any information provided pursuant to this Section
7.2 shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
March 25, 2017, between Seller and Husky Oil Operations Ltd. (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
automatically, without any action by any party thereto, upon the Closing.



Section 7.3Filings and Authorizations

(a)Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all
authorizations, consents, clearances, Orders and approvals necessary for their
execution and delivery of, and the performance of their obligations pursuant
to each Transaction Document and the Transactions. Seller and Buyer shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another in exchanging and providing such
information to each other and in making the filings and requests referred to
in this Section 7.3. Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
supply such reasonable assistance as may be reasonably requested by any other
Party in connection with the foregoing. Each of Seller and Buyer (w) shall
promptly notify the other Party of (and, at any other Party's reasonable
request, supply to such other Party a copy of) any material communication (or
other correspondence or memoranda) from or to, and any proposed understanding
or agreement with, any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings
pertaining to the Transactions; (x) shall consult and cooperate with the other
Party in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments and opinions made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party
in connection with all meetings, actions, discussions and proceedings with any
Governmental Authority relating to such filings, including, subject to
applicable Laws, permitting the other Party to review in advance any proposed
material written communication to any such Governmental Authority (redacted as
appropriate to protect a Party's competitively sensitive or confidential
information) and incorporate the other Party's reasonable comments; (y) agrees
not to participate in any material meeting or discussion with any such
Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
Party the opportunity to attend; and (z) shall comply, as promptly as is
reasonably practicable, with any requests received by such Party from such
Governmental Authority for additional information, documents or other
materials. Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of
information by one Party to the other Party may be made on a counsel-only
basis to the extent required under applicable Law or as appropriate to protect
confidential business information.



(b)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Buyer and Seller
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to (i) make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with
the other Party and as promptly as practicable, but in any event not later
than 10 Business Days after the date hereof, filings of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, which Notification and Report Form shall
request early termination of the applicable waiting period; and (ii) secure
the expiration or termination of any waiting periods under the HSR Act as
promptly as practicable. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any
filing fees under the HSR Act in connection with the Transactions. Buyer shall
take any and all steps and make any and all undertakings reasonably necessary
to avoid, eliminate or resolve any and all impediments under any Antitrust Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other Person with
respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer's reasonable
best efforts shall include agreeing to take any action as may be required by a
Governmental Authority in order to (i) obtain all necessary consents,
approvals and authorizations as soon as reasonably possible, and in any event
before the Outside Date, or (ii) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted, dissolved, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect as
part of any Action and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of
the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required under any circumstances
to do or undertake any of the following if it would reasonably be considered
to materially affect Buyer's or its Affiliates' ownership of, or freedom to
operate the businesses or assets of Buyer, its Affiliates or the Company: (x)
to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate
Order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of Buyer, its Affiliates or the Company; or (y) to agree to any
limitation on the conduct or businesses of Buyer, its Affiliates or the
Company. In furtherance of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed by
Seller that the sale, divestiture or disposition of any Terminal would
materially affect Buyer's or its Affiliates' ownership of, or freedom to
operate the businesses or assets of Buyer, its Affiliates or the Company
(including the Business).



(c)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties agree to
notify the Transactions to CFIUS pursuant to Section 721 and, in furtherance
of the foregoing, the Parties will cooperate: (i) to prepare and submit a
draft voluntary notice Filing in accordance with Section 721, within 20
Business Days after the date hereof, promptly provide CFIUS with any
additional or supplemental information requested by CFIUS during such pre-
Filing consultation period and after resolution of all questions and comments
received from CFIUS on such draft Filing, promptly submit a final voluntary
notice Filing; (ii) to promptly respond (and in any event respond no later
than as required by CFIUS) to any request for additional information,
documents or other materials; and (iii) with each other in connection with the
CFIUS voluntary notice Filing and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of CFIUS. In connection with the foregoing,
Seller and Buyer shall (1) give each other advanced notice of all meetings
with any CFIUS official relating to the Transactions, (2) give each other an
opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (3) keep each other
reasonable apprised with respect to any oral communications with any CFIUS
officials regarding the Transactions, (4) provide each other with a reasonable
advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the
views of the other with respect to, all written communications with a CFIUS
official regarding the Transactions, (5) provide each other (or counsel of
each Party, as appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or
from any CFIUS official relating to the Transactions and (6) organize regular
reviews with each other regarding the progress of the Filing. Any disclosures,
rights to participate or provisions of information by one Party to the other
may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable
Law or as appropriate to protect confidential business information. The
Parties intend that, if required in connection with obtaining CFIUS Approval,
that Buyer will reasonably consider, at Buyer's discretion, appropriate
mitigations as may be required by CFIUS, provided that any such mitigation not
materially affect Buyer's or its Affiliates' ownership of, or freedom to
operate the businesses or assets of Buyer, its Affiliates or the Company.



(d)Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article XI, if
CFIUS Approval is not obtained on or before December 1, 2017, the Parties
agree to meet and confer on December 15, 2017 regarding the status of CFIUS
Approval. If the Parties mutually agree that there is a reasonable opportunity
to receive CFIUS Approval on or before March 1, 2018, and all of the
conditions set forth in Article IX and X, other than the conditions set forth
in Sections 9.4 and 10.4 and those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, have been satisfied or waived or are likely to be
satisfied as of December 31, 2017, the Parties will agree to extend the
Outside Date for one additional month (i.e., until January 31, 2018), and the
Parties will confer and seek to reach agreement in good faith as to whether a
change in the Outside Date merits a change in any other dates set forth in
this Agreement. If CFIUS Approval is not obtained within 15 days prior to the
expiration of that period, the process set forth in the foregoing sentence
will be repeated. Although the Outside Date may be extended in accordance with
the foregoing, the Parties currently contemplate they will not extend that
date beyond March 1, 2018.



Section 7.4Further Assurances. During the Interim Period, each of the Parties
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill or obtain the
fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the
Transactions, including the execution and delivery of any documents,
certificates, instruments or other papers that are reasonably required for the
consummation of the Transactions. Following the Closing, at any Party's
request (and at such requesting Party's sole cost and expense), the other
Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute and deliver such
additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances, and take such
further actions as may be reasonably requested by a Party to carry out the
provisions hereof and of each Transaction Document and to give effect to the
Transactions.



Section 7.5Public Announcements. Each Party will consult with the other Party
before issuing any initial press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement and will not issue any such press release or make any other initial
public announcement regarding the execution hereof without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Otherwise, during the Interim Period, no Party will
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that
nothing herein will prohibit any Party from issuing or causing the publication
of any such press release or public announcement to the extent that such
disclosure is, based on the advice of legal counsel, required by Law or Order
or by the rules of (or an applicable listing agreement with) a national
securities exchange, in which case the Party making such determination will,
if practicable under the circumstances, use commercially reasonable efforts to
allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of its issuance or publication.





Section 7.6Employee Matters.

(a)Seller shall update Schedule 5.14(a) no less than 20 days prior to the
Closing Date. At least 14 days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall make
offers of employment in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.6,
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, to each Business Employee whose
employment does not transfer by operation of law. Buyer shall also be afforded
an opportunity to offer employment to those employees of Seller listed on
Schedule 7.6(a) (the "Optional Employees"), which offers, if any, Buyer shall
make at least 14 days prior to the Closing Date. Any such offer of employment
for any Business Employee shall be for a position that is comparable to the
position held by such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date,
at a geographic location that is within 25 miles of the Business Employee's
place of work immediately prior to the Closing Date, and made on terms and
conditions sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 7.6(b) and Section
7.6(h), if applicable. Buyer will give each Business Employee no less than
five Business Days in which to accept or reject Buyer's employment offer.
Within one Business Day of making an offer to an Optional Employee, Buyer
shall provide to Seller written notice of the making of such offer of
employment. In the event that Buyer ultimately determines not to make an offer
to any Optional Employee, Buyer shall notify Seller of such determination
thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable after the making of such
determination. Seller shall be entitled to make its own offer of continued
employment to those Optional Employees it chooses in its sole discretion on
terms and conditions determined in its sole discretion. Buyer will provide
Seller with a list at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
which shall contain as of that date the names of the Business Employees and
the Optional Employees who accepted Buyer's or its Affiliate's employment
offer. Any Business Employee and any Optional Employee who accepts an offer of
employment from Buyer will be treated as a Continuing Employee as provided
below. Each Continuing Employee shall become an employee of Buyer as of the
Closing Date. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section 7.6 or
as required by applicable Law, effective as of the Closing Date, the
employment of the Continuing Employees with Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
shall terminate.



(b)Commencing on the Closing Date and continuing through the date that is 12
months following the Closing Date (the "Continuation Period") and except with
respect to Union Employees who shall be subject to the terms of Section 7.6(h)
and shall not be subject to this Section 7.6(b), Buyer shall provide or cause
to be provided to each Business Employee and any Optional Employee who accepts
an offer of employment from Buyer set forth in Section 7.6(a) above as of the
Closing (collectively, the "Continuing Employees") (i) a base salary or wage
rate and other compensation, as applicable, at least equal to those provided
to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and
(ii) employee benefits (excluding participation in any defined benefit pension
plan, retiree medical plan, and any special retention, severance, or change in
control benefits) which are substantially similar in the aggregate to those
then in effect for such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and (iii) Buyer shall provide for full credit, where applicable, for
purposes of participation and eligibility and vesting under any benefit or
compensation plans, programs, policies, arrangements, and practices, and in
addition for purposes of determining amount or level of benefits under any
vacation, paid-time off and severance pay plans, of Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company, but excluding participation in any defined benefit
pension plan or retiree medical plan) ("Buyer Plans"), for such Continuing
Employees' service with Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent recognized by Seller, the
Company and their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. For purposes of
each Buyer Plan providing medical, dental, prescription drug, and/or vision
benefits to any Continuing Employee, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company
or any third-party insurance carriers to, cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, and waiting periods of such



Buyer Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or
were inapplicable under the analogous Seller Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall provide, or cause the Company or any third-party
insurance carriers to provide, each Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to becoming eligible to participate in any Buyer Plans under the analogous
Seller Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under such Seller
Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-insurance, or annual maximum
out-of-pocket requirements under the applicable Buyer Plan.



(c)Effective as of the Closing Date and except as set forth in Section 7.6(h)
with respect to Union Employees, Continuing Employees and their applicable
dependents shall cease to accrue benefits under any Seller Plans. Buyer shall
take any and all actions reasonably necessary to permit each Continuing
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, and including plan
loans) to a 401(k) plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code established
or designated by Buyer in an amount equal to any eligible rollover
distribution made to such Continuing Employee (including plan loans) from any
Seller Plan which is a 401(k) plan.



(d)Buyer shall be responsible for medical and dental expenses covered under
the terms of the Buyer Plan or Buyer Plans providing medical and dental
benefits (the "Buyer Medical Plans") incurred on or after the Closing Date by
a Continuing Employee and/or his covered dependents who are enrolled in the
Buyer Medical Plans, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
shall cause all Continuing Employees and their dependents to be eligible for
enrollment in and coverage under such Buyer Plans effective immediately
following the Closing. Seller shall be responsible only for medical and dental
expenses covered under the terms of the applicable medical and dental Seller
Plans incurred prior to the Closing Date by a Continuing Employee and/or his
covered dependents.



(e)Buyer shall offer each Continuing Employee who is participating in Seller's
or Seller's Affiliate's health care flexible spending account and/or dependent
care flexible spending account coverage under Buyer's or Buyer's Affiliate's
health care flexible spending account and dependent care flexible spending
account. Each Continuing Employee's benefits options, elections and balances
under Seller's or Seller's Affiliate's health care flexible spending account
and/or dependent care flexible spending account, as applicable, in effect
immediately prior to the Closing shall be carried over from Seller's or
Seller's Affiliate's applicable flexible spending account to Buyer's or
Buyer's Affiliate's corollary flexible spending account. Any positive balance
in the Continuing Employee's flexible spending account shall be transferred
from Seller's or Seller's Affiliate's flexible spending account to Buyer's or
Buyer's Affiliate's corollary flexible spending account as soon as
administratively practicable after the Closing. If there is a negative balance
in the Continuing Employee's health care flexible spending account (caused,
for example, by the Continuing Employee's having been reimbursed from his
health care flexible spending account in excess of his contributions to the
account as of the Closing), Buyer shall transfer an amount equal to such
negative balance to Seller as soon as administratively practicable after the
Closing.





(f)Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, assume all vacation or any
other paid time off accrued or accumulated with respect to Continuing
Employees through the Closing Date, and Seller shall provide Buyer at the
Closing with cash sufficient to satisfy all such accrued vacation or paid time
off accumulated with respect to Continuing Employees through the Closing Date,
and Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, allow all Continuing
Employees to use such assumed vacation and paid time off during the remainder
of calendar year in which Closing occurs. Thereafter, Buyer and the Company
shall recognize such Continuing Employees' years of service as service with
Buyer under the vacation policy and any other paid time off policy or program
of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate, including for determinations of vacation
or any other paid time off for which the employee is eligible.



(g)Buyer shall bear any costs related to any claims made by any Business
Employee for any severance payments and benefits (including the employer
portion of any employment Taxes) arising out of or in connection with Buyer's
failure to make offers of employment to any Business Employee in accordance
with this Agreement; for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not bear any such
costs with respect to any such claims made by any Optional Employees to whom
Buyer determines not to offer employment. Seller shall bear any costs related
to any claims made by any Business Employee for any severance payments and
benefits (including the employer portion of any employment Taxes) arising out
of or in connection with such Business Employee's refusal of an offer of
employment made by Buyer in compliance with Section 7.6(a).



(h)Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees
effective as of the Closing, (i) to be the "successor" for all purposes under
and to be bound by the Collective Bargaining Agreement, (ii) to provide any
and all compensation and benefits required under the terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreement to those Continuing Employees who immediately prior to
the Closing were Union Employees and (iii) to otherwise be bound by, to assume
and comply with all of the terms and conditions of all obligations under the
Collective Bargaining Agreement. Buyer shall execute and deliver, on or prior
to the Closing, all documentation and agreements required to effectuate the
foregoing.



(i)At or promptly following the Closing, Seller will deliver to Buyer all
files, reports, records, and other materials, within Seller's or its
Affiliates' possession or control as are reasonably necessary to administer
the Pension Plan. During the Interim Period, Seller shall pay, or cause to be
paid, as and when due, any contribution to the Pension Plan required pursuant
to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. Seller shall on a timely
basis make any filing required in connection with the Transactions pursuant to
Section 4043 of ERISA. Provided that (i) no acceleration of Liabilities,
demand for payment or funding, or condition on the consummation of the
Transactions shall have been imposed on Buyer, its Affiliates or the Company
by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in connection with the Pension
Plan and (ii) at or prior to the Closing, Seller makes a contribution to the
Pension Plan in the amount of $1,966,777, Buyer agrees, effective as of the
Closing, to assume from Calumet GP, LLC the sponsorship of the Pension Plan
and all assets and Liabilities of or arising under the Pension Plan. The
Parties shall execute such documents and shall make or cause to be made such
filings with any Governmental Authority as they shall deem necessary and
appropriate to accomplish the transfer of the sponsorship of and all assets
and Liabilities of or arising under the Pension Plan from Calumet GP, LLC to
Buyer.





(j)With respect to any compensatory award which is based on, convertible into,
or calculated by reference to the equity of Seller or any of its Affiliates
and which is held by any Business Employee (the "Compensatory Equity Awards"),
Seller shall not take any action to cancel or otherwise cause the forfeiture
of such Compensatory Equity Awards due to such Business Employee accepting an
offer of employment from Buyer and such Compensatory Equity Awards shall
thereafter continue to vest in accordance with their respective terms.



(k)The provisions of this Section 7.6 are for the sole benefit of the Parties
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any
current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of the
Company, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any representatives thereof), other
than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 7.6) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no provision of
this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee
or former employee of the Company or any Business Employee (in each case
including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of continued
employment by Seller, the Company, their respective Affiliates or otherwise.
Nothing herein, other than as expressly provided in this Section 7.6, shall
(i) preclude the ability of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to terminate any employee of the Company for cause, (ii) require
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to continue any
compensation or benefits plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Closing Date or (iii) amend any
Seller Plan, Buyer Plan, Benefit Plan or other compensation plans or
arrangements.



Section 7.7WARN Act. Buyer shall not take any action on or after the Closing
Date that would create any Liability for Seller or any of its Affiliates under
the WARN Act. Seller shall have no obligation to provide any notice or
notification under the WARN Act in respect of, or as a result of, any actions
taken by Buyer or its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date. Seller shall
not take any actions prior to the Closing Date that would create any Liability
for Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or the Company, under the WARN Act.



Section 7.8Confidentiality. For a period of three years following the Closing
Date, Seller shall hold and shall cause each of its Affiliates to hold, and
Seller shall cause its and its Affiliates' respective officers and directors
to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by Order or Law, all
Confidential Information concerning the Company, using at least the same
degree of care with respect to such Confidential Information as it would take
to preserve the confidentiality of its own similar information (and in any
event at least a reasonable degree of care).



"Confidential Information" means confidential documents and information of the
Company but shall not include documents or information that can be shown by
Seller to have been (i) in the public domain prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) in the public domain after the date of this Agreement through
no fault of Seller or its Affiliates, (iii) made lawfully available to Seller
or its Affiliates after the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a
third party who is not known by Seller or its Affiliates, after reasonable
inquiry, to be under an obligation of confidentiality to Buyer or the Company;
or (iv) lawfully developed by Seller after the date of this Agreement without
the use of Confidential Information.



Section 7.9Insurance Matters.



(a)Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained in full force and effect
the Seller Insurance Policies (or substantially comparable insurance policies
that provide no less favorable coverage for the Company and its assets and
properties than exists under the Seller Insurance Policies as of the date
hereof, and such substantially comparable insurance policies shall be deemed
to be Seller Insurance Policies for purposes of this Section 7.9) until the
Closing. For any claims under the Seller Insurance Policies that occur prior
to the Closing, Seller will continue to notify the applicable insurers on a
timely basis with respect to such claims and comply with the terms and
conditions of the applicable Seller Insurance Policies. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that, from and after the Closing Date (i) Seller or its Affiliates may
terminate coverage with respect to the properties and assets of the Company
and the Business under the Seller Insurance Policies, except such coverage
provided by the Environmental Policy which shall be assigned to Buyer at the
Closing pursuant to the Environmental Policy Assignment Agreement; (ii)
neither the properties and assets of the Company nor the Business will be
covered under Seller Insurance Policies following the Closing Date (except to
the extent set forth under Section 7.9(b)); and (iii) Buyer shall become
solely responsible for procuring, maintaining and paying for all insurance
policies with respect to post-Closing insurance coverage for the properties
and assets of the Company and the Business.



(b)During the Interim Period, Buyer may elect, by delivery of written notice
to Seller, to obligate Seller, on behalf of the Company, to file and continue
to pursue claims to recover proceeds under and pursuant to the terms of the
Seller Insurance Policies from and after the Closing Date, to the extent such
claims arise out of or relate to an act or failure to act, event or
circumstance occurring prior to the Closing, in each case, to the fullest
extent available under such Seller Insurance Policies (the "Continuing
Insurance"). Seller or its Affiliates will pay over any proceeds of any
related insurance recovery to the Company to the extent actually received by
Seller or its Affiliates. In the event that Buyer makes such election, Buyer
shall, to the extent that credit support is required by Ace American Insurance
Company to allow Seller and the Company to continue to access the Continuing
Insurance following Seller's removal of credit support relating to the
Continuing Insurance, provide the replacement credit support so required (in
an amount not to exceed $500,000 unless Buyer otherwise agrees). Seller agrees
to not withdraw any credit support it has provided for the Continuing
Insurance during the Interim Period without first providing thirty (30) days'
prior written notice to Buyer, it being agreed that neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall otherwise have any obligation to provide or otherwise
maintain any credit support following the Closing to maintain the Continuing
Insurance.





(c)Buyer shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all amounts which are
to be paid to insured Persons pursuant to any Seller Insurance Policy in
respect of any insurance claim relating to the Company or the conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing Date; provided, that with respect to any such
insurance claim, Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Company) shall be
entitled to receive and retain such amounts to the extent necessary to
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Company) for Losses
actually incurred by Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Company) in
respect of such insurance claim.



Section 7.10Seller's Brand Name; Removal of Logos and Signs.



(a)As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no
event later than 60 days after the Closing Date, or, with respect to
immaterial displays which are not readily visible to the public (i.e., hardhat
emblems, etc.), no later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will stop
using and otherwise not exploit, the Company Marks in any form, including by
removing or permanently obliterating all references to the Company Marks that
appear on any asset of the Company, including all signage, storage containers,
uniforms and clothing, promotional or advertising literature, stationery,
purchase order forms, labels, office forms and packaging (including signs
displaying Seller's or Seller's Affiliates' emergency contact telephone
numbers or otherwise using or displaying the Company Marks in whole or in
part). Without limiting the foregoing restrictions, in no event will Buyer use
or display the Company Marks in any way other than in substantially the same
manner used by the Business immediately prior to the Closing Date. During any
period that Buyer is using the Company Marks as provided in this Section 7.10,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform customers, suppliers
and contractors of the Company that it is not affiliated with Seller or
Seller's Affiliates and is using the Company Marks with permission solely to
facilitate the transition of the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, Buyer shall have no right to create any new materials containing the
Company Marks to be used in the operation of the Business.



(b)Buyer expressly acknowledges and confirms that Buyer shall not receive, any
right, title or interest in or to the Company Marks, except the limited right
to use Company Marks for the sole purpose of permitting Buyer to complete the
phase out of such use in accordance with this Section 7.10.



Section 7.11Books and Records. From and after the Closing, each Party shall
preserve and keep the books and records of the Company that relate to any
period on or before the Closing Date for a period of six years after the
Closing Date (or longer for Tax records if required by Article VIII) and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, will make available to the other
Party, during normal business hours, such books and records as are necessary
or useful in connection with the preparation or filing of any tax return, any
tax claim, audit or similar investigation or any dispute, litigation or
defense of any indemnification claim, or in order to enable the other Party to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement or to perform the
Transactions. Following such six year period (or such longer period with
respect to Tax records as may be required in Article VIII), each Party may
retain or destroy such books and records in accordance with its record
retention policies in effect from time to time; provided, however, that such
Party shall notify the other Party prior to any such destruction and, if
requested in writing by the other Party within 10 days after such notice, such
Party shall deliver such books and records to the other Party, at the other
Party's sole expense, prior to such destruction. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 7.8, Seller may retain
copies of the books and records and minute books of the Company relating to
the period on or before the Closing Date.





Section 7.12Release and Replacement of Bonds and Guaranties. From the date
hereof until the Closing, and until the expiry of the Credit Support Retention
Period solely with respect to any Seller Credit Support that has not been
replaced and released on or prior to the Closing in accordance with the below,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) arrange for substitute
credit support arrangements for the guaranties, letters of credit, bonds,
security deposits, financial assurances and other surety obligations that are
entered into by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Company) in connection with the Business and are set forth on Schedule
7.12, as may be updated by Seller during the Interim Period to reflect any
terminated or replaced credit support arrangements (so long as any such
replacements are on substantially equivalent terms) including reductions in
time and dollar limits of parent guaranties in alignment with the Credit
Support Retention Period (provided that any change may not adversely affect
the Business) (collectively, "Seller Credit Support") outstanding as of the
Closing Date, or (b) otherwise assume all obligations under the Seller Credit
Support; provided, that under either clause (a) or (b), Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the creditor or other
counterparty a full release of the provider of such Seller Credit Support for
reimbursement to the creditor or fulfillment of other obligations to a
counterparty in connection with amounts drawn under the Seller Credit Support
solely to the extent related to the Company or the Business (such releases,
collectively, the "Credit Support Releases"). At the Closing, Buyer shall
provide Seller with letters of credit reasonably satisfactory to Seller and in
the same amount as any Seller letters of credit that are Seller Credit Support
and remain outstanding as of the Closing. Buyer shall cause each such letter
of credit to remain outstanding until the applicable Seller letter of credit
is returned to Seller, at which time Seller shall promptly return the
corresponding Buyer-provided letter of credit to Buyer. Except as permitted
above, Seller and its Affiliates shall not reduce, terminate or withdraw any
Seller Credit Support until the earlier of (i) the replacement thereof in
accordance with the foregoing and (ii) the date that is 12 months following
the Closing Date (the "Credit Support Retention Period"); provided, however,
that Seller may withdraw or terminate any Seller Credit Support for which
Buyer has failed to indemnify or reimburse Seller for pursuant to the next
sentence of this Section 7.12, which failure has not been waived by Seller in
writing or cured by Buyer within five Business Days after receipt by Buyer of
written notice thereof from Seller. With respect to any Seller Credit Support
related to the Company or the Business that remains in place following the
Closing, until the expiry of the Credit Support Retention Period, (x) Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the provider of such Seller Credit
Support from any and all Liabilities relating to, resulting from, or arising
from, or arising out of, any claim made against such Person under any such
Seller Credit Support solely to the extent related to the Company or the
Business and (y) Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any costs (in
respect of costs payable to unaffiliated third parties) and reasonable costs
(in respect of internal costs) incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates
following the Closing in connection with such Seller Credit Support, it being
agreed that any such costs in respect of Seller Credit Support that also
relates to other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates shall be reasonably
allocated among the Business and such other businesses. Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection
with Buyer's obligations under this Section 7.12.





Section 7.13IT Systems.



(a)On or prior to the Closing Date, except as expressly set forth otherwise in
the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall provide all IT systems
necessary for Buyer to continue to conduct the Business following Closing,
including sufficient hosting environments for all software applications,
networking and telecommunications infrastructure for all Business sites,
sufficient storage for all data to be received from Seller or its Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement, a data center (or equivalent mechanism) capable of
supporting the entire end-user environment of the Business and all personnel
and service contract(s) required to support all IT systems necessary for the
conduct of the Business.



(b)Using information and reasonable assistance provided by Seller, Buyer shall
develop and, by no later than 20 Business Days following the Closing Date,
provide to Seller a detailed plan for the termination of all services provided
under the Transition Services Agreement by the end of the term of such
agreement. Such plan will include a description of Buyer's capability and
allocation of resources to (i) allow provision of the transition services in
accordance with the Transition Services Agreement and (ii) accomplish a
complete transition to Buyer's IT systems in accordance with the applicable
termination date under the Transition Services Agreement.



(c)Except as set forth under the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall be
solely responsible for purchasing, licensing, or otherwise procuring for
itself any third party-owned IT systems or third party-owned IT equipment as
may be needed to permit Buyer to use such third party-owned IT systems or
third party-owned IT equipment in connection with the Business after the
Closing Date.



(d)During the Interim Period, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and
its and their respective representatives to, cooperate in good faith and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and its
Affiliates with the transition of the Business to Buyer, at Seller's cost and
expense. Such transition assistance shall include making available to Buyer,
its Affiliates and/or their respective representatives (i) appropriate
knowledgeable business, operations, and administration personnel and any other
personnel, including for initial transition meetings with the appropriate
personnel, (ii) subject to the terms of the third party agreements related
thereto, the underlying data and model structure for the materials set forth
in Schedule 7.13(d), which documentation and data shall be delivered to Buyer
at or prior to the Closing, and (iii) any other support that in each case is
reasonably necessary for such transition, including such support as is
reasonably required in connection with the services and documentation listed
in Schedule 7.13(d); provided, that all such transition assistance shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business of Seller or any of its Affiliates
and, provided, further, that Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any third party
expenses in connection with providing such transition assistance.



Section 7.14Excluded Assets. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, at its sole
cost and expense (including any related Taxes), cause the Company to enter
into such conveyances and assignment agreements and make all filings with
Governmental Authorities or third parties, in each case in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, as may be required to cause all right, title
and interest in and to the Excluded Assets to be transferred to Seller or its
designee. Following the Closing, Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense
(including any related Taxes), remove any Excluded Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory
in accordance with Schedule 2.4. Seller shall, in connection with such
removal, exercise a reasonable degree of care to avoid damage to any of the
Company's assets and properties, and to the extent any such assets and/or
properties are damaged in connection with such removal, Seller shall promptly
fully repair such asset and/or property to the condition in which it existed
immediately prior to such damage in accordance with Prudent Industry Practice
at Seller's sole cost and expense.



Section 7.15Consent Decree. On and after the Closing, Buyer and the Company
shall satisfy, perform and assume and shall hold harmless and indemnify Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Company) from and against all obligations
and liabilities under the Consent Decree, except with respect to any Excluded
Environmental Liabilities.



Section 7.16Wrong Pocket. If after the Closing Date Seller or any of its
Affiliates receives any payment related to the Business which should be paid
to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Seller agrees to promptly
remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to Buyer. If after the
Closing Date Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) receives
any payment that is not related to the Business, then Buyer agrees to promptly
remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to Seller. The Parties
agree to treat the ultimate recipient of any such funds as having received the
payment ab initio for all applicable Tax purposes.



Section 7.17Consents; Estoppels; Product Agreement; Back-to-Back Agreements.



(a)Buyer acknowledges that the consents set forth on Schedule 7.17(a) (the
"Specified Consents") are required from third parties to Contracts to which
the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party, and the Specified Consents
have not been obtained and may not be obtained. Buyer agrees that neither the
Company nor Seller shall have any liability whatsoever to Buyer (and Buyer
shall not be entitled to assert any claims against Seller and its Affiliates)
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain the Specified Consents or
because of the default, acceleration or termination of any such Contract or
loss of right under any such Contract as a result thereof. Buyer further
agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained
herein shall be breached or deemed breached and no condition of Buyer shall be
deemed not to be satisfied as a result of (a) the failure to obtain any
Specified Consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration,
termination or loss of right or (b) any Action commenced or threatened by or
on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain
any Specified Consent or any such default, acceleration, termination or loss
of right.



(b)During the Interim Period, Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Company
to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at the earliest
practicable date all consents and approvals required to consummate the
Transactions (including the BNSF Consents) and to obtain the Estoppels;
provided, however, that neither Seller nor the Company shall be obligated to
pay any consideration (other than consideration that is otherwise payable by
Seller or the Company pursuant to an existing Contract), commence any
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation to any third party from whom
consent or approval is requested, including, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any Estoppel.





(c)During the Interim Period, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to amend the Product
Agreement such that the Company is substituted as the counterparty thereto,
pursuant to an amendment agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Buyer.



(d)If any Commercial Contract or New Commercial Contract cannot be assigned to
the Company as of the Closing Date, whether as a result of the failure to
obtain required third party consents or otherwise (a "Restricted Contract"),
then notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither this Agreement
nor any document executed in connection herewith shall constitute a transfer,
assignment, conveyance or delivery of or an attempted transfer, assignment,
conveyance or delivery of any Restricted Contract, and Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, at Seller's sole cost and expense, use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates to take such actions as are
reasonably necessary (including obtaining any required third party consents)
to transfer, assign, convey and deliver any such Restricted Contract to the
Company as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date; provided, however,
that none of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
required to pay or incur any cost or expense to obtain any third party consent
other than de minimis administrative costs associated with obtaining such
consent (which shall be borne by Seller). Pending the completion of such
actions relating to any Restricted Contract, the Parties shall cooperate with
each other in any commercially reasonable arrangement selected in the
reasonable discretion of Buyer designed to provide the Company with the
benefits of use of such Restricted Contract (or any other right or benefit
related thereto, including the enforcement for the benefit of the Company, at
Seller's sole cost and expense, of any and all rights of Seller or its
applicable Affiliate against a third party associated therewith to the extent
such costs and expenses arise as a result of such arrangement). Such
reasonable arrangement may include, if requested by Buyer, the execution of
back-to-back agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (each, a "Back-
to-Back Agreement") to effect the transfer to the Company of the benefits and
burdens of or on Seller or its applicable Affiliate under any Restricted
Contract. Any such Back-to-Back agreement shall provide that (i) Seller or its
applicable Affiliate shall continue to be bound by such Restricted Contract,
(ii) the Company shall perform and discharge fully all of Seller's or its
applicable Affiliate's obligations under such Restricted Contract after the
Closing Date, (iii) Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall, without further
consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to the Company promptly all
monies, rights and other considerations received in respect of such Restricted
Contract, and (iv) Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall promptly exercise
or exploit the beneficial rights and options of the Company under such
Restricted Contract. Buyer and the Company shall be responsible for the
reasonable out of pocket costs incurred by Seller or its Affiliates that arise
as a result of the Restricted Contract, except as a result of Seller's or its
Affiliates' breach thereof. Seller shall be responsible for the reasonable out
of pocket costs incurred by Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates
that arise as a result of a Back-to-Back Agreement, but only to the extent
those costs are incurred because of the existence of the Back-to-Back
Agreement. Once any such action for the transfer, assignment, conveyance and
delivery of a Restricted Contract is completed, Seller shall or shall cause
its applicable Affiliate to promptly transfer, assign, convey and deliver such
Restricted Contract to the Company, and the Company shall assume all
Liabilities associated with such Restricted Contract (other than any such
Liabilities caused solely by the breach of such Restricted Contract by Seller
or any of its Affiliates) pursuant to an Acceptable Assignment Agreement
(which Acceptable Assignment Agreement the Parties shall prepare, execute (or
cause the execution of) and deliver in good faith at the time of such
transfer).





Section 7.18Title Policies. Buyer may procure, at its sole cost and expense,
title insurance policies insuring Buyer's fee simple title and leasehold
interests to the Company Properties and an American Land Title Association
survey of the Real Property; provided, that the foregoing shall not be deemed
to mitigate Seller's representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.16
and its obligations under Section 7.9, and in connection therewith, Seller and
its Affiliates shall execute and deliver such customary title affidavits and
other customary documents, agreements, endorsements, affidavits, instruments
and information, in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Seller and to the extent reasonably required by Buyer's title insurance
company or surveyor.

documents of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms until the sixth anniversary
of the Closing Date. For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause the Company not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision
in the Company's Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended, relating to
the exculpation or indemnification (or limitation on liability) of any
officers and/or the managing member of the Company. Solely with respect to
this Section 7.20, no Indemnified Person shall have any recourse against the
Company for any Losses unless such Indemnified Person has used commercially
reasonable efforts to first seek recovery for such Losses under the Seller
Insurance Policies.



(b)If Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each
case, the successors and assigns of such Persons, as the case may be, shall
expressly assume and be bound by the obligations set forth in this Section
7.20.



(c)This Section 7.20 is intended to be for the benefit of each of the
Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such Indemnified Person as if
such Indemnified Person were a party to this Agreement. The obligations of
Buyer under this Section 7.20 shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person without the consent of
such Indemnified Person.





(d)For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 7.20 and the
indemnification contemplated by this Section 7.20 shall not be subject to any
of the survival or other limitation or exclusive remedy provisions of Article
XII.



Section 7.21Environmental Policy Assignment Agreement. From the date of this
Agreement until 60 days following the Closing Date, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer the Environmental Policy
Assignment Agreement, duly executed by all of the parties thereto, as promptly

Section 7.22Specified Projects.



(a)Seller shall cause all Contracts related to the development and
construction of the Specified Projects to be entered into by the Company (and
not by Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates) in accordance with the budgets
therefor, and Seller shall negotiate the terms of such Contracts in a manner
consistent with Prudent Industry Practices (and the terms thereof shall
reflect such negotiation). Seller shall, promptly following the date hereof,
cause the assignment to the Company of all Contracts entered into by Seller or
any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company) prior to the date hereof with
respect to the Specified Projects.



(b)During the Interim Period, Seller shall cause the Company to diligently
pursue the development and construction of each Specified Project in
accordance with Seller's engineering standards and the budget for such
Specified Project, including to continue to make capital expenditures related
to such Specified Capital Projects in accordance with its applicable budget.
Without limitation of Seller's obligations under the preceding sentence,
neither Seller nor the Company makes any representation or warranty, express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, at law or in equity, in respect of Seller's,
the Company's or any of their respective Affiliates' performance of
development and construction of the Specified Projects pursuant to this
Section 7.22(b), including with respect to merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose. Seller shall not, and shall cause the Company not to,
change the scope of the Superior Flex Project outlined in Schedule 1.1(b) in
any material respect without the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller shall keep
Buyer fully informed of all material developments relating to or in connection
with each Specified Project, including by providing prompt written notice to
Buyer if it appears at any time that there will be, or would reasonably
expected to be, any material delay in the development and construction of such
Specified Project (a "Delay") or any material deviation from the approved
"authority for expenditures" for the development and construction of such
Specified Project (a "Deviation"). In the event of a Delay, Seller shall
promptly develop and provide to Buyer a reasonably detailed plan to mitigate
the Delay in respect of the affected Specified Project and shall consult with
Buyer as to the substance thereof and incorporate all reasonable comments
thereto (if any) provided by Buyer. In the event of a Deviation, Seller shall
promptly provide to Buyer a reasonably detailed description of the Deviation
and the projected impact on the development and construction of the affected
Specified Project, together with any other information reasonably requested by
Buyer related to such Deviation.

the development and construction of the Specified Projects, and Seller shall
cause the Company to provide to such observers (i) all material notices,
information, reports and other materials which are furnished to Business
Employees, the sole member and/or the officers of the Company with respect to
the Specified Projects, in the same form and at the same time as is furnished
to such Persons, (ii) reasonable access to the properties and assets related
to the Specified Projects and (iii) the right to participate in all material
discussions conducted at any meetings held to discuss the Specified Projects.
Seller may not rely on any statements or



communications made by Buyer's observers in connection with the development
and construction of the Specified Projects or the monitoring and observation
thereof by such observers.



Section 7.23Reports. During the Interim Period, Seller shall in good faith
provide to Buyer (a) unaudited quarterly financial statements of the Company
for the prior quarter, and (b) monthly business, operating and financial
reports with respect to the Company and/or the Business (which reports are
understood to include the PandL and normal operating events for the prior

business. Seller shall provide the foregoing financial statements and reports
promptly following the date that such financial statements and reports are
available to Seller and/or the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall not be obligated to provide
any information that would cause Seller or the Company to breach any
confidentiality obligation to any third party or as prohibited by applicable
Law. Without limitation of any of Seller's representations and warranties set
forth in Article V, Seller does not make any representations or warranties
regarding any additional information (i.e., information not otherwise the
subject of Seller's representations or warranties under Article V) provided
pursuant to this Section 7.23.



Section 7.24Rhinelander Closure Letter. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a Rhinelander Closure Letter as promptly as
practicable prior to Closing. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed as
to the status of the Rhinelander Closure Request and shall promptly provide
Buyer with a copy of all material written correspondence, reports or other
documents received or submitted to a Governmental Authority with respect
thereto, including a copy of the Rhinelander Closure Letter promptly upon
receipt thereof. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a)
Seller's receipt of such Rhinelander Closure Letter and (b) December 31, 2017
(provided, that Seller may extend such date to February 28, 2018 by delivery
of written notice to Buyer on or prior to December 31, 2017), Buyer shall not,
without Seller's prior written consent or unless required by Environmental Law
or Environmental Permit or otherwise required by any Governmental Authority,

soil borings, hand borings, geoprobes, test pits or monitoring wells with
respect to any polychlorinated biphenyls that may be present in the soil or
groundwater at the Rhinelander Terminal site. In the event such Rhinelander
Closure Letter is not obtained prior to such date, Buyer may perform any such
testing or sampling and conduct any Remedial Action that may be required
pursuant to Environmental Law or Environmental Permit or otherwise required by
a Governmental Authority to obtain a Rhinelander Closure Letter.

Buyer in advance of such access. THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE,
RELEASE AND AGREE TO RELEASE, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES TO THE EXTENT ARISING
OUT OF, RESULTING FROM, OR RELATING TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES RELATED TO THE ACCESS AFFORDED TO THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES UNDER

Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer a true and correct copy thereof.



ARTICLE VIII

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.1Tax Returns.



(a)Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare or cause to be prepared
all Tax Returns of the Company for all Pre-Closing Periods (the "Pre-Closing
Tax Returns"), and all Tax Returns of the Company for all Straddle Periods, in
each case, to the extent such Tax Returns are required to be filed after the
Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
past practice of the Company except to the extent otherwise required by Law.
Not later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return,
Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all supporting
documentation and workpapers, to Seller for its review and reasonable comment.
Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreement
regarding such Tax Returns prior to filing. In the event Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve any dispute within 10 days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Return, such dispute shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
resolution shall be binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally between Buyer and Seller. If any
dispute with respect to such Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date
of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner that Buyer
deems correct without prejudice to Seller's rights hereunder; provided, that,
for the avoidance of doubt, if such Tax Return is filed prior to the dispute
being resolved by the Accounting Firm and the Accounting Firm subsequently
concludes that the Tax Return, as filed, is incorrect, such Tax Return shall
be amended consistent with the conclusion of the Accounting Firm. Nothing in
this Section 8.1(a) shall control as to any determination of the allocation of
the manner by which the parties allocate the purchase price governed by
Section 2.6. For avoidance of doubt, Seller shall retain all obligations to
file its income Tax returns (including to the extent such Tax Returns reflect
income, gain, loss or deduction relating to the operations of the Company, or
deemed disposition of the Company's assets pursuant to the Transactions).





(b)To the extent that Buyer and Seller enter into a Transition Services
Agreement in connection with the Transactions that governs the preparation of
Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods that is
inconsistent with this Section 8.1, the terms of the Transition Services
Agreement shall govern for the term thereof.



Section 8.2Straddle Period Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall, unless
prohibited by applicable Law, close the taxable period of the Company as of
the end of the Closing Date. If applicable Law does not permit the Company to
close its taxable year on the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is
assessed with respect to a Straddle Period, the Taxes, if any, attributable to
such Straddle Period shall be allocated as follows: any allocation of (a)
Taxes, other than those referred to in clause (b) below, shall be made by
means of a closing of the books and records of the Company as of the end of
the Closing Date, and (b) property Taxes and ad valorem Taxes attributable to
a Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two periods in proportion to
the number of days in each such period.



Section 8.3Refunds. Buyer agrees to pay or cause the Company to pay to Seller
the amount of any refund (net of any costs or Taxes attributable to such
refund) received after the Closing Date by Buyer or its Affiliates, including
the Company, in respect of any Taxes paid prior to the Closing respecting the
Company or the Business; provided, however, that Seller shall not be entitled
to the amount of any Tax refund that is (a) taken into account in the
calculation of Final Net Working Capital or (b) payable to another Person
pursuant to any Contract to which the Company is a party as of the Closing.
The Parties shall cooperate, each at its own expense, in order to take all
reasonably necessary steps to claim any such refund. Subject to the foregoing,
the amount of any such refund received by Buyer or its Affiliates (including
the Company) shall be paid to Seller within 15 days after such refund is
received.



Section 8.4Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation.



(a)After the Closing, except as provided in Section 8.4(b), Buyer, at its sole
cost and expense, shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own
choosing, of any audit, claim for refund or administrative judicial or other
proceeding involving any asserted Tax or refund with respect to the Company
(any such audit, claim for refund or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax
referred to herein as a "Contest"). If the resolution of any Contest could
affect any Tax of the Company for which Seller is responsible under this
Agreement, any Tax of any Seller Indemnified Party, or the right to a refund
of Tax that is for the account of Seller, Buyer shall give Seller prompt
notice of the Contest (which shall not be less than five days after notice
from the Governmental Authority of such Contest) (provided, however, that the
failure of Buyer to provide such notice within such time period shall not
relieve Seller of its obligations under Article XII, except to the extent (and
only to the extent) that such failure to give notice shall actually and
materially prejudice any defense or claim available to Seller), and, subject
to Seller's right to control such Contest under Section 8.4(b), Buyer shall
control and defend such Contest diligently and in good faith, shall permit
Seller (at Seller's expense) to participate in such Contest, and shall not
settle, compromise or concede any portion of such Contest without the consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned.



(b)In the case of a Contest that is being conducted after the Closing that
relates to a Pre-Closing Period or solely to the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on or before the Closing, and the resolution of which could
materially affect any Tax of the Company for which Seller is responsible under
this Agreement, any Tax of a Seller Indemnified Party, or the right to a
refund of a Tax that is for the account of Seller, Seller shall have the
right, at its election (and at Seller's expense), to assume control of the
conduct of such Contest by providing written notice to Seller, provided, that
if Seller elects to assume control, (i)



Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of all material correspondence, notices
and other written materials received from or provided to any Governmental
Authorities and shall otherwise keep Buyer reasonably advised of significant
developments in the Contest and of significant communications involving
representatives of the Governmental Authorities, (ii) Buyer may participate in
such Contest (at Buyer's expense), and (iii) Seller shall not settle,
compromise or concede any such Contest without the consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.



(c)In the case of a Contest that is being conducted after the Closing (other
than those that Seller has elected to control), Buyer shall control the
conduct of such Contest, provided, that to the extent such Contest relates to
any Tax that Seller could be responsible for under this Agreement, any Tax of
a Seller Indemnified Party, or the right to a refund that is the for the
account of Seller (i) Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of all material
correspondence, notices and other written materials received from or provided
to any Governmental Authorities and shall otherwise keep Seller reasonably
advised of significant developments in the Contest and of significant
communications involving representatives of the Governmental Authorities, (ii)
Seller may participate in such Contest (at Seller's expense), and (iii) Buyer
shall not settle, compromise or concede any such Contest without the consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to
books and records) and assistance relating to the Company as is reasonably
requested for the filing of any Pre-Closing Tax Returns or Straddle Returns
and the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Contest relating
to any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period. Seller and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period and each shall
execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 8.4. Any information
obtained under this Section 8.4(b) shall be kept confidential, except as may
be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the
conduct of a Contest or other Action relating to Taxes.



(e)Buyer and Seller shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, (i) use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain its
Tax and accounting records that are pertinent to the Company or the Business
and relate to the Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods for ten years and
shall thereafter provide the other Party with written notice prior to any
destruction, abandonment or disposition of all or any portions of such
records, (ii) upon the written request of a Party made within 10 days of
receipt of the notice provided under clause (i) above, transfer such records
to the other Party prior to any such destruction, abandonment or disposition
and (iii) allow the other Party and its agents and representatives, at times
and dates reasonably and mutually acceptable to the Parties, to from time to
time inspect and review such records as such Party may deem necessary or
appropriate; provided, however, that in all cases, such activities are to be
conducted by such Party during normal business hours and at such Party's sole
expense. Any information obtained under this Section 8.4(e) shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Action relating
to Taxes.





(f)Buyer and Seller shall, upon request, use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including with respect to the Transactions).



Section 8.5Transfer and Conveyance Taxes. Buyer shall prepare and file all Tax
Returns with respect to, all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary, excise, Real Property transfer or similar Taxes
incurred as a result of the Transactions. Any such Taxes shall be borne 50% by
Buyer and 50% by Seller. Seller and Buyer shall jointly file all required
change of ownership and similar statements required to be filed by both
Parties.



Section 8.6Amended Tax Returns. After the Closing Date, unless required by
applicable Law, no amended Tax Return of the Company with respect to a Pre-
Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be filed by or on behalf of the
Company without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.



Section 8.7Tax Treatment. Buyer and Seller agree, for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, to treat the purchase contemplated by Section 2.1 as a purchase of
the assets of the Company by Buyer and will take no actions inconsistent with
such treatment.

or Tax sharing agreements between the Company and Seller or other Affiliate
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing

Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination hereunder
will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 11.1, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement
will terminate; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by
Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, because of the willful
breach of this Agreement by the other or because one or more of the conditions
to the terminating Party's obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied
as a result of the other Party's failure to comply with any of their
obligations under this Agreement, the terminating Party's right to pursue all
legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired; provided, further,
that the provisions of this Section 11.2, Section 7.5 and Article XIII shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.





ARTICLE XII

INDEMNIFICATION



Section 12.1Survival. Each representation and warranty contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect
until 12 months following the Closing (the "Release Date"); provided, however,
that the Seller Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.9 shall survive until the date that is 30
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (the
Release Date or such other date described above, as applicable, the
"Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section
12.1, if Buyer or Seller delivers written notice to the other Party of a claim
for indemnification, which claim is asserted in good faith and with reasonable
specificity (to the extent known at such time) on or prior to the applicable
Expiration Date, such claim shall survive until finally resolved or judicially
determined. Other than the Interim Operating Covenants, none of the covenants
or other agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date
other than those which, by their terms, contemplated performance after the
Closing Date, and each such surviving covenant and agreement shall survive the
Closing indefinitely or for the period expressly contemplated by its terms.
The Interim Operating Covenants shall survive for a period ending on the
Release Date.



Section 12.2Indemnification of Buyer. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article XII, from and after the Closing, Seller (in such capacity, the
"Seller Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and its Affiliates,
including the Company, and their respective directors, employees, officers,
partners, members, agents, officers, representatives, attorneys, accountants,
and equity holders, and their respective successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from, against and in respect of any and all
Losses based upon, arising out of or incurred as a result of any of the
following:



(a)any breach of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
Seller in this Agreement (other than the Seller Fundamental Representations
and the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.9);



(b)any breach of, or any inaccuracy in, the Seller Fundamental Representations
and the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.9;



(c)the Excluded Assets or the transfer thereof as required by Section 7.14;



(d)any breach or default in performance by Seller of (i) any covenant,
agreement or obligation of Seller contained in this Agreement that by its
terms is to be performed in whole or in part following the Closing and (ii)
the Interim Operating Covenants;



(e)all Taxes imposed on or payable by (including through withholding and
deposit obligations of) the Company (or any predecessor thereof) for or
attributable to any Pre-Closing Period or the portion of any Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date (determined as provided in Section 8.2);



(f)the Specified Matters;







(g)the Excluded Environmental Liabilities; and



(h)the assignment of the Commercial Contracts from the Company to Seller or
its Affiliates and the assignment of (or failure to assign) the Commercial
Contracts and the New Commercial Contracts from the Seller or its Affiliates
to the Company, in each case as contemplated under Schedule 7.1; provided,
that for purposes of this Section 12.2(h), "Losses" shall also include any
special, indirect, and/or consequential damages incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of or incurred as a result of such
assignments (or failure to assign), to the extent that such damages are the
natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of such assignments (or
failure to assign).



Section 12.3Indemnification of Seller. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article XII, from and after the Closing, Buyer (in such capacity, the
"Buyer Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller and its directors,
employees, officers, Affiliates, partners, members, agents, representatives,
attorneys, accountants, and equity holders, and their respective successors
and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from, against and
in respect of any and all Losses based upon, arising out of or incurred as a
result of any of the following:



(a)any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in Article VI of this Agreement; and



(b)any breach or default in performance by Buyer of any covenant, agreement or
obligation of Buyer contained in this Agreement that by its terms is to be
performed in whole or in part following the Closing.



Section 12.4Limitations.



(a)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) Seller
Indemnifying Parties shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any Loss pursuant to Section 12.2(a) in respect of any
individual claim (or series of related claims) involving Losses of less than
$100,000 (each such claim or series of related claims that exceeds such
threshold being a "Qualifying Claim"), (ii) Seller Indemnifying Parties shall
not have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party for any Loss
pursuant to Section 12.2(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
Losses in respect of Qualifying Claims incurred or sustained by all Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to which Buyer Indemnified Parties would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification under Section 12.2(a) exceeds 1.5% of
the Base Consideration (the "Deductible"), whereupon the Seller Indemnifying
Parties shall be liable only for such Losses in respect of Qualifying Claims
in excess of 1% of the Base Consideration, but subject to Section 12.4(a)(iii)
and the other provisions of this Article XII; and (iii) the aggregate
liability of Seller Indemnifying Parties to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for Losses under Section 12.2(a) shall in no event exceed 10% of the
Base Consideration (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and
Section 2.5).



(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
the aggregate liability of Seller Indemnifying Parties or Buyer Indemnifying
Parties under this Agreement shall in no event exceed the Base Consideration
(as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and Section 2.5).







(c)Without duplication of any amounts paid to Seller or any of its Affiliates
under Schedule 2.9, the obligation of any Party or parties obligated to
provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") to indemnify any Person
entitled to indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") against any Losses under
Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 or otherwise under this Agreement shall be
reduced (i) by any amounts actually received by any Indemnified Party pursuant
to any indemnification by, or any indemnification or other agreement with, any
third party with respect to such Losses or the underlying reasons therefor
(net of reasonably expected costs of recovery) and (ii) by the amount of
insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement actually
received by any Indemnified Party from third parties, including third party
insurers, with respect to such Losses or the underlying reasons therefor (net
of reasonably expected costs of recovery). In furtherance of the foregoing, if
an Indemnifying Party pays to any Indemnified Party an amount in respect of
Losses and any Indemnified Party thereafter receives from a third party a sum
in respect of the matter giving rise to such Losses that would cause such
Indemnified Party to recover amounts in the aggregate that exceed the amount
of the relevant Losses, then (A) if the excess was paid to a Buyer Indemnified
Party, Buyer shall promptly repay to Seller an amount equal to such excess and
(B) if the excess was paid to a Seller Indemnified Party, Seller shall
promptly repay to Buyer an amount equal to such excess. The Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies
or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses.



(d)Each Indemnified Party shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses within a reasonable amount of time following the discovery
by such Indemnified Party of the fact, event or circumstance giving rise to
such Losses. The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, reasonably cooperate with the other Parties in connection with any
mitigation efforts related to Item 3 in Schedule 1.1(i), which mitigation
efforts may include entering into Back-to-Back Agreements in accordance with
Section 7.17(d).



(e)In the event that any specific Losses are suffered by any one or more
Indemnified Party for which any such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification and any such Indemnified Party is actually indemnified by an
Indemnifying Party in full with respect to all such Losses incurred by such
Indemnified Party, then such Losses shall be deemed to no longer exist and,
therefore, any further recovery by such Indemnified Party or any other
Indemnified Party from any Indemnifying Party for such same Losses would
constitute an unintended "double" recovery and shall be prohibited under this
Agreement.



(f)No Buyer Indemnified Party may assert a claim for indemnification for, and
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Seller Indemnified Parties from, against and
in respect of any and all Losses resulting from or arising out of, or that are
attributable to the following:



(i)any cessation of operations at the Real Property after the Closing Date;





(ii)any invasive or subsurface sampling, surveys, investigations, inspections,
analyses or testing, including of any soil, water, air or other media, by or
on behalf of the Company, any Buyer Indemnified Party or any of their
respective Affiliates after the Closing Date that are not required by any
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit or otherwise by any Governmental
Authority;



(iii)any liabilities arising under Environmental Laws relating to Hazardous
Materials initially discovered by a Governmental Authority as a result of any
notifications to, or communications with, any Governmental Authority by or on
behalf of the Company, any Buyer Indemnified Party or any of their respective
Affiliates, including any officer, employee or representative of the Company,
any Buyer Indemnified Party or any of their respective Affiliates, on or after
the Closing Date that are not required by any Environmental Law or
Environmental Permit;



(iv)any contribution to or exacerbation of any Losses arising under
Environmental Laws, including any Release of Hazardous Materials by any act or
omission by or on behalf of the Company, any Buyer Indemnified Party or any of
their respective Affiliates after the Closing Date; or



(v)any change in Environmental Law following the Closing Date.



(g)With respect to any Remedial Action that is required to satisfy any claim
for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnified Party:



(i)Any Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the obligation),
by delivery of written notice to Seller, to conduct and control such Remedial
Action; provided, however, that, if a Buyer Indemnified Party elects to
conduct such Remedial Action (A) the Buyer Indemnified Party shall reasonably
consult with Seller in good faith in advance as to the conduct of such
Remedial Action, and shall reasonably consider in good faith all reasonable
comments in respect thereof (if any) provided by Seller; provided, further, to
the extent there is a material change in the scope or cost associated with
such Remedial Action, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall further consult with
Seller in good faith prior to taking such Remedial Action, (B) the Buyer
Indemnified Party shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of the
Remedial Action, (C) the Buyer Indemnified Party shall provide Seller with a
copy of any material written correspondence, reports or other documents
received or submitted to a Governmental Authority with respect to such
Remedial Action, and (D) Seller shall have the right to reasonably monitor
such Remedial Action to the extent such monitoring does not interfere with
Buyer's ability to conduct and control such Remedial Action. Any costs
incurred by Seller relating to such monitoring shall be at Seller's sole cost
and expense and shall not limit any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties' rights
to indemnification hereunder. The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with
one another in connection with any such Remedial Action.



(ii)The Parties acknowledge and agree to the additional terms set forth in
Schedule 12.4(g)(ii) with respect to any Remedial Action.



(h)No Buyer Indemnified Party may assert a claim for any Taxes or other
related Losses to the extent (i) the Taxes are included in the calculation of
the Final Net Working Capital; (ii) the Taxes resulted from Company
transactions on the Closing Date but after the Closing that were outside the
ordinary course of business; (iii) the Taxes resulted from actions taken by
Buyer or post-Closing actions taken by the Company that violate any covenant,
representation, or other obligation of Buyer in this Agreement; or (iv) the
Taxes are for any period (or portion of any Straddle Period) beginning after
the Closing Date; provided, that the limitation in clause (iv) shall not apply
to Taxes resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty in Section
5.9(e) or Section 5.9(i). A Buyer Indemnified Party's liability for Taxes (and
other related Losses)



that arise out of an obligation to indemnify or succeed to another Person's
Tax liability (pursuant to a Contract, as a successor or transferee, or
otherwise) shall be limited to such Taxes (and other related Losses) resulting
from actions or events occurring prior to the Closing.



Section 12.5Limitation on Remedies.



(a)EXCEPT (i) PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE XII, (ii) PURSUANT TO SECTION 7.12,
(iii) PURSUANT TO ARTICLE VIII, (iv) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ADJUSTMENTS UNDER
ARTICLE II or (v) IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO A
PARTY'S FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL AND WILLFUL BREACH, BUT OTHERWISE NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF THE CLOSING OCCURS, NO PARTY
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY, AND NO PARTY SHALL MAKE ANY CLAIM, FOR ANY LOSS,
INCLUDING FOR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH OR SAFETY MATTER (AND THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES), UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, COMMON LAW,
OTHER LAWS OR OTHERWISE.



(b)NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO INDEMNIFYING
PARTY OR INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT
LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT (I) COMPRISING
COMPONENTS OF LOSSES CLAIMED BY A THIRD PARTY IN ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIM FOR
WHICH ANY PARTY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY ANOTHER PARTY HEREUNDER OR (II)
PROVIDED UNDER SECTION 12.2(H) OR ITEM 3 OF SCHEDULE 1.1(I).



Section12.6Additional Matters.



(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article XII, the procedures set
forth in Article II and the dispute resolution procedures set forth therein
shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies for claims relating to the
calculation of the Post-Closing Inventory Adjustment Amount, the Post-Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Post-Closing Reimbursable
Capital Expenditures Adjustment Amount, and no Indemnified Party shall have
recourse under this Article XII for breaches of representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement to the extent that Losses that are attributable to
such breach are taken into account in determining the Post-Closing Inventory
Adjustment Amount, the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and
the Post-Closing Reimbursable Capital Expenditures Adjustment Amount pursuant
to Article II.







(b)To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any amounts payable under this
Article XII shall be treated by Buyer and Seller as adjustments to the
purchase price.



(c)For purposes of determining if an indemnifiable breach has occurred under
Section 12.2 and Section 12.3 and for purposes of determining the amount of
Losses suffered from any such breach, the Parties shall exclude all
qualifications as to materiality, including "material", "material adverse
effect", Material Adverse Effect or any other words of similar import or
effect, except as used in Section 5.8(d) or in the defined term "Material
Contract" (or in the definition of such term).



Section 12.7Exclusive Representations and Warranties.



(a)BUYER HAS CONDUCTED ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, REVIEW AND ANALYSIS
OF THE BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PROSPECTS, CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR
OTHERWISE) AND ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN
PROVIDED ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE PERSONNEL, PROPERTIES, ASSETS, PREMISES, BOOKS
AND RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND DATA OF SELLER AND THE COMPANY FOR SUCH
PURPOSE. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES (i) THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN ARTICLE IV AND ARTICLE V OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IN ANY
OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS, (ii) THAT NEITHER SELLER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS MADE OR
IS MAKING ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE
INTERESTS, THE COMPANY, THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ENFORCEABILITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, INCLUDING AS
TO (A) THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OR USEFULNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE
REAL OR TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY INCLUDED IN THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, (B)
THE USE OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, AND THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE
COMPANY BY BUYER AFTER THE CLOSING IN ANY MANNER OR (C) THE PROBABLE SUCCESS
OR PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AFTER THE CLOSING AND (iii)
EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN ARTICLES IV
AND V AND IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE INTERESTS AND ALL ASSETS OF
THE COMPANY ARE CONVEYED ON AN "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" BASIS.



(b)SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
SET FORTH IN ARTICLE VI OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENT CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS AND (ii) EXCEPT FOR SUCH
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
BUYER REGARDING BUYER OR THE TRANSACTIONS.





Section 12.8Notice of Claims. If a claim for Losses (a "Claim") is to be made
by an Indemnified Party against an Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
shall give written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party as soon
as practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact,
condition or event which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may
be sought; provided, however, that the failure to provide such Claim Notice
shall not excuse the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
Article XII, except to the extent (and only to the extent) that such failure
to give Claim Notice shall actually and materially prejudice any defense or
claim available to the Indemnifying Party. Such Claim Notice shall describe
the Claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to
such Indemnified Party, including the amount or estimated amount of damages
sought thereunder to the extent ascertainable, any other remedy sought
thereunder and any relative time constraints, together with a copy of the
written notification of such Claim.



Section 12.9Third Party Claims.



(a)Promptly, and in any event within 30 days, after the receipt by any
Indemnified Party of notice of the commencement of any Action by or involving
a third party (such Action, a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified
Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim
with respect thereto is to be made against any Indemnifying Party, give such
Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail in light of the circumstances then known to such Indemnified Party,
including the amount or estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the
extent ascertainable, any other remedy sought thereunder and any relative time
constraints, together with a copy of the written notification of such Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
provide such notice within such time period shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Article XII, except to the extent (and
only to the extent) that such failure to give notice shall actually and
materially prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying Party.



(b)The Indemnifying Party may assume and control the defense of any Third
Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at
the Indemnifying Party's sole expense, by notifying the Indemnified Party of
such intent to do so within 30 days after receiving notice of the Third Party
Claim and only so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified
Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party has the financial resources to defend such Third Party
Claim, which evidence may consist of Seller's and its Affiliates' publicly
available financial statements, (ii) the Third Party Claim involves only money
damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim actively and
diligently and (iv) there is no conflict of interest between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of such defense and all
defenses to the Indemnified Party are available to the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after
satisfying the conditions set forth in this Section 12.9(b), the Indemnifying
Party will have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute or defend such Third Party Claim.





(c)If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after
satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 12.9(b), (i) it may not settle
such Third Party Claim unless (A) there is no admission of liability on the
part of any Indemnified Party and no finding or admission of any violation of
any Law or any violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party,
(B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that have been paid or will
be promptly paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (C) the settlement
includes an unconditional release of each Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable, from all Losses with respect to such Third
Party Claim; otherwise, the consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the Indemnified Party to such settlement
shall be required, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
and to employ, at its own expense, counsel separate from counsel employed by
the Indemnifying Party, subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control
the defense of the Third Party Claim, except that the fees, costs and expenses
of one counsel and, if necessary, local counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are
both named parties to the proceedings and counsel to the Indemnified Party
shall have reasonably determined that representation of both parties by the
same counsel would violate applicable ethical standards due to actual or
potential conflicts of interest between them.



(d)If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense, fails to notify the
Indemnified Party within the time frame required by Section 12.9(b) that the
Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third Party Claim, or if the
Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party will have the right to defend the Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in
good faith and may be settled in accordance with Section 12.9(e), and the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees, costs and expenses
of one counsel and, if necessary, local counsel to the Indemnified Party.



(e)Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



(f)Each Party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim, including
keeping the other Party fully informed of all material developments relating
to or in connection with any Third Party Claim, making available records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending Party,
management and employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim. Any
consent to be given by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Section 12.9
shall be given by Buyer acting on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and
any consent to be given by the Seller Indemnified Parties under this Section
12.9 shall be given by Seller acting on behalf of Seller Indemnified Parties.





(g)To the extent that any matter set forth in this Section 12.9 may overlap or
conflict with any procedures contained in Section 8.4, the provisions of
Section 8.4 shall govern with respect to Taxes.

set forth in this Section 13.3.

Section 13.4Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended, except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each Party. Waiver of any term or
condition of this Agreement by any Party shall only be effective if in writing
and shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or failure of
the same term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement. No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.



Section 13.5Binding Effect; Assignment. Neither Party may assign its rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of Buyer (in the case of any assignment by Seller) or Seller (in the
case of any assignment by Buyer), which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and any purported assignment or other
transfer without such consent shall be void and unenforceable. No assignment
will relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations hereunder. This

the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.



Section13.6No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as expressly set forth in
Article XII (Indemnification), nothing in this Agreement shall confer any
rights, remedies or claims of any nature whatsoever upon any Person not a

Section 13.7Governing Law. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be
governed by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect
to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.



Section 13.8Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process. Any Action seeking

any way relating to, this Agreement or the Transactions, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, shall be brought and
maintained solely in the Court of Chancery in and for the State of Delaware
and, to the extent that jurisdiction cannot be obtained in the Court of
Chancery, then the state courts located in the State of Delaware or the
Federal Courts of the United States sitting within the State of Delaware and
any appellate court from such state or Federal Court, and each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts in any such Action and irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such court
or that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any Party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in Section 13.3 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such Party.



Section 13.9WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.9.



Section13.10Specific Performance. Buyer and Seller agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that they would not have any adequate remedy at law if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with
the terms hereof or were otherwise breached. Buyer and Seller further agree
that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions hereof and to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(a) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity (it
being understood that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Parties from
raising other defenses to a claim for specific performance or other equitable
relief under this Agreement). Buyer and Seller further agree that no Party
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition



to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 13.10, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.



Section 13.11Rules of Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Each covenant, term and provision of this
Agreement will be construed simply according to its fair meaning; prior drafts
of this Agreement or the fact that any clauses have been added, deleted or
otherwise modified from any prior drafts of this Agreement will not be used as
an aid of construction or otherwise constitute evidence of the intent of the
Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of such prior drafts.



Section 13.12Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will not be affected, impaired, invalidated or rendered
unenforceable so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a
determination, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the Transactions may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



Section 13.13Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart
were upon a single instrument, each of which will be deemed an original but
all of which together will be deemed one and the same agreement. Facsimile
signatures or signatures received as a .pdf attachment to electronic mail will
be treated as original signatures for all purposes of this Agreement. This
Agreement will become effective when, and only when, each Party will have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties.



Section 13.14Disclosure Schedules. Except as set forth in this Agreement, the
inclusion of any information (including dollar amounts) in Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by any
Party that such information is required to be listed on such section of the
relevant schedule or is material to or outside the ordinary course of business
of any Person. The information contained in this Agreement, the exhibits
hereto and the Disclosure Schedules is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to
be an admission by any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever
(including any violation of any Law or breach of contract). Unless the context
otherwise requires, all capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules
shall have the respective meanings assigned in this Agreement. The Disclosure
Schedules set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in
the Disclosure Schedules relates; provided, however, that any information set
forth in one Section of the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to apply to
each other section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably
apparent on its face. Seller shall have the right to disclose additional
matters in a supplemental letter to Buyer from time to time prior to the
Closing that come to the Knowledge of Seller after the date hereof that, had
such additional matters been existing, occurring or known on the date hereof,
would have been required to be set forth or described in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules delivered to Buyer on the date of this Agreement in order to make
the representations and warranties true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date. Such additional matters shall be
disregarded and deemed to not have cured any breach of any representation or
warranty under this Agreement for purposes of (a) determining if the
conditions to Closing in Article IX have been met and (b) the indemnification
rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereunder.



Section 13.15Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, financing source,
lender, agent, attorney, representative or Affiliate of any Party or of any of
their respective Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is expressly a party to
this Agreement) shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement (including any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement) or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, this Agreement or the Transactions; provided, however, that nothing
in this Section 13.15 shall limit any liability of the Parties for breaches of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Party hereby waives, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates to waive, any claims or other method of
recovery, whether based in contract, tort or strict liability or under
applicable Law, against any such Persons arising under, in connection with or
related to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
Transactions.
