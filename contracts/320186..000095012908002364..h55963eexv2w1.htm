   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Upon approval of the Holdings Common Stock for listing on the NYSE, a Grey Wolf Designated Director shall be the lead independent director of the Surviving Corporation who will chair executive sessions of the Surviving Corporations board of directors in accordance with Section 303A.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

 Section 2.6 Effect on Basic Equity Securities. 

  

 (a) _Basic Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Basic Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Basic Dissenting Shares and shares of Basic Common Stock to be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor pursuant to  _Section 2.6(b)_) shall, by virtue of the Basic Merger, be converted into the right to receive: (i) 0.9195 (the " _Basic Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Holdings (the " _Holdings Common Stock_ "), together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock as provided below (the " _Basic Stock Consideration_ "), and (ii) an amount in cash equal to $6.70, without interest (the " _Basic Cash Consideration_ "). The Basic Stock Consideration and the Basic Cash Consideration are referred to herein collectively as the " _Basic Merger Consideration_." At the Effective Time, each such share of Basic Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of any such share of Basic Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such share of Basic Common Stock, except the right to receive (i) certificates for shares of Holdings Common Stock or non-certificated shares of Holdings Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Holdings Book-Entry Shares_ "), as elected by such holder, in accordance with _Section 2.11(b)_, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with  _Section 2.11(e)_ upon surrender of such appropriate shares of Basic Common Stock, (iii) any dividends or distributions on shares of Holdings Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.11(c)_, and (iv) the Basic Cash Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Basic Treasury Stock_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Basic Common Stock that are held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Basic or any of the Basic Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

  

 (c) _Basic Stock Options_. 

  

 (i) All options to acquire shares of Basic Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time and identified in _Section 4.3(b)_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter and all options to acquire shares of Basic Common Stock issued hereafter under Basics equity plans 

   ##### 

  

    

(collectively, the " _Basic Stock Plans_ ") or otherwise issued after the
date hereof, but in the case of any issuance after the date hereof, only if
issued in accordance with _Section 5.2(d)_ (individually, a " _Basic Option_
" and collectively, the " _Basic Options_ ") shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time, subject to the modifications described in this
_Section 2.6(c)_ and _Section 5.17_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter. Prior to
the Effective Time, Holdings and Basic shall take all actions (if any) as may
be required to permit the assumption of such Basic Options by Holdings
pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_ so that at the Effective Time, the Basic
Stock Plans shall be assumed by Holdings (with such adjustments thereto as
may be required to reflect the Basic Merger, including the substitution of
Holdings Common Stock for Basic Common Stock thereunder) and the Basic
Options shall be assumed and adjusted by Holdings, subject to the same terms
and conditions as under the applicable Basic Stock Plan and the applicable
option agreement entered into pursuant thereto (after giving effect to any
modifications effected in accordance with  _Section 5.17_ of the Basic
Disclosure Letter), except that immediately following the Effective Time (A)
each such Basic Option shall be exercisable only for that whole number of
shares of Holdings Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest
whole share, which shall be rounded down to the extent necessary to comply
with Section 424 of the Code) of the number of shares of Basic Common Stock
subject to such Basic Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Basic Adjustment Fraction, and (B) the exercise price
per share of Holdings Common Stock shall be an amount equal to the exercise
price per share of Basic Common Stock subject to such Basic Option in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Basic Adjustment
Fraction (the price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the
nearest whole cent); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the
exercise price be less than the par value of Holdings Common Stock. The
adjustments provided in this paragraph with respect to any Basic Options
shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent
with Sections 424(a) and 409A of the Code. 

  

 (ii) From and after the date of this Agreement, Basic and the Basic Subsidiaries shall take no action to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability of any Basic Options in connection with the Basic Merger except to the extent such acceleration is required under the terms of such Basic Options or change in control agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement or as set forth in _Section 5.17_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter. To the extent such acceleration or exercisability is required under the terms of such Basic Options or other awards made under the Basic Stock Plans upon the occurrence of a change of control (as such term or similar term is defined in the applicable Basic Stock Plan or change in control agreement) or as required or permitted pursuant to _Section 5.17_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter, Basic shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions (if any) as may be required to cause such acceleration or exercisability to occur at the Effective Time and immediately prior to the assumption of the Basic Stock Plan by Holdings (to the extent permitted under the terms of such Basic Stock Plan as of the date of this Agreement or in accordance with _Section 5.17 of the Basic Disclosure Letter_). 

  

 (iii) Prior to the Closing, Holdings shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) covering the shares of Holdings Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Basic Options and other awards made under the Basic Stock Plans prior to the Effective Time to be assumed pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_ and shall cause such registration statement to remain effective for as long as there are outstanding any such Basic Options. Except as otherwise specifically provided by this _Section 2.6(c)_ or as set forth in 

   ##### 

  

    

 _Section 5.17_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter, the terms of the Basic
Options and the relevant Basic Stock Plans, as in effect at the Effective
Time, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the Basic Options
after giving effect to the Basic Merger and the assumptions by Holdings as set
forth above. 

  

 (iv) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Holdings shall deliver to the holders of Basic Options to be assumed pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_ appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Basic Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Basic Options and stating that such Basic Options and such agreements shall be assumed by Holdings and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section 2.6(c)_ or as set forth in _Section 5.17_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter). 

  

 (d) _Basic Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Basic Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Holdings Common Stock based upon the Basic Exchange Ratio and the Basic Cash Consideration, but, except as provided in _Section 5.17_, each share of Holdings Common Stock so issued and all Basic Cash Consideration paid with respect to such shares of Basic Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same vesting or risk of forfeiture provisions to which such shares of Basic Restricted Stock were subject immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that at the election of the holder of Basic Restricted Stock made in writing and delivered to Basic and Holdings on or before the third Business Day immediately preceding the date of the Basic Meeting, Holdings shall, in exchange for each share of Basic Restricted Stock, deliver in lieu of the foregoing a number of shares of Holdings Common Stock equal to the Basic Adjustment Fraction, but in each case, each such share of Holdings Common Stock so issued shall be subject to the same vesting or risk of forfeiture provisions to which the shares of Basic Restricted Stock were subject immediately prior to the Effective Time other than as set forth on _Section 5.17_. 

  

 (e) _Basic Dissenting Shares._ Basic Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive any Basic Merger Consideration, but instead shall represent only the right to receive the amount determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, such Basic Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the amount determined pursuant to the provision of Section 262 of the DGCL, unless a Basic Dissenting Stockholder holding particular Basic Dissenting Shares has failed to perfect or lost his right to receive, or has effectively withdrawn his demand for, the fair value of such shares under the DGCL. If a Basic Dissenting Stockholder has so failed to perfect or lost his right to receive, or has effectively withdrawn his demand for, the amount determined under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the shares of Basic Common Stock held by such holder shall cease to be Basic Dissenting Shares and shall entitle such holder to receive the Basic Merger Consideration in respect of such shares as provided in _Section 2.6(a)_, and promptly following the occurrence of such event and upon the surrender or transfer of Basic Certificate(s) representing such shares, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation (as applicable) shall deliver to such holder the Basic Merger Consideration in respect of such shares. Basic shall comply with those provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL which are required to be performed by Basic prior to the Effective Time to the 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonable satisfaction of Grey Wolf. Basic shall give Grey Wolf (i) prompt
notice of any written demands to exercise dissenters rights with respect to
any shares of Basic Common Stock under the DGCL actually received by Basic,
any withdrawals of any such demands and any other documents or instruments
received by Basic relating to dissenters rights and (ii) an opportunity to
participate at its own expense in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for fair value under the DGCL. Basic shall not, except

At and before the Effective Time, Basic and Holdings shall comply with all other provisions of the Basic Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Mergers and assumption of the obligations under the Basic Senior Notes Indenture in connection with the Mergers. 

  

 Section 2.8 Effect on Grey Wolf Equity Securities. 

  

 (a) _Grey Wolf Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Grey Wolf Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time or that is deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the terms of the indentures for the Grey Wolf Convertible Notes in connection with the conversion procedures for the Grey Wolf Convertible Notes (other than Grey Wolf Dissenting Shares and shares of Grey Wolf Common Stock to be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor pursuant to Section 2.8(b)) shall, by virtue of the Grey Wolf Merger, be converted into the right to receive: (i) 0.2500 (the " _Grey Wolf Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of Holdings Common Stock, together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock as provided below (the " _Grey Wolf Stock Consideration_ "), and (ii) an amount in cash equal to $1.82, without interest (the " _Grey Wolf Cash Consideration_ "). The Grey Wolf Stock Consideration and the Grey Wolf Cash Consideration are referred to herein collectively as the " _Grey Wolf Merger Consideration_." At the Effective Time, each such share of Grey Wolf Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of any such share of Grey Wolf Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such share of Grey Wolf Common Stock, except the right to receive (i) certificates for shares of Holdings Common Stock or Holdings Book-Entry Shares, as elected by such holder, in accordance with  _Section 2.11(b)_, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with  _Section 2.11(e)_ upon surrender of the appropriate shares of Grey Wolf Common Stock, (iii) any dividends or distributions on shares of Holdings Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.11(c)_, and (iv) the Grey Wolf Cash Consideration.

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Grey Wolf Stock Options_. 

  

 (i) All options to acquire shares of Grey Wolf Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time and identified in _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter and all options to acquire shares of Grey Wolf Common Stock issued hereafter under Grey Wolfs equity plans (collectively, the " _Grey Wolf Stock Plans_ ") or otherwise issued after the date hereof, but in the case of any issuance after the date hereof, only if issued in accordance with  _Section 5.2(d)_ (individually, a " _Grey Wolf Option_ " and collectively, the " _Grey Wolf Options_ ") shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time, subject to the modifications described in this _Section 2.8(c)_ and in _Section 5.18_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter.

of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter). 

  

 (iii) Prior to the Closing, Holdings shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) covering the shares of Holdings Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Grey Wolf Options and other awards made under the Grey Wolf Stock Plans prior to the Effective Time to be assumed pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_ and shall cause such registration statement to remain effective for as long as there are outstanding any such Grey Wolf Options.

If a Grey Wolf Dissenting Stockholder has so failed to perfect or lost his right to receive, or has effectively withdrawn his demand for, the amount

Stock held by such holder shall cease to be Grey Wolf Dissenting Shares and

following the occurrence of such event and upon the surrender of the Grey
Wolf Certificate(s) representing such shares, the Exchange Agent and the

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Holdings shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of shares of Basic Common Stock or Grey Wolf Common Stock: (i) a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Holdings may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for Holdings Common Stock, the Basic Cash Consideration or Grey Wolf Cash Consideration (as applicable), any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Holdings Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.11(c)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.11(e)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Basic Common Stock or Grey Wolf Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) shares of Holdings Common Stock, and (B) a check representing the amount of cash (including the Basic Cash Consideration or Grey Wolf Cash Consideration (as applicable) and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any), and unpaid dividends and distributions (if any), which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_, after giving effect to any required withholding tax, and, if applicable, the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Basic Cash Consideration, Grey Wolf Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Basic Common Stock or Grey Wolf Common Stock. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Grey Wolf Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Grey Wolf or a transfer of ownership of Basic Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Basic, the proper number of shares of Holdings Common Stock, together with a check for the Basic Cash Consideration or Grey Wolf Cash Consideration, as the case may be, and cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions (if any), may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate or Uncertificated Share representing such Grey Wolf Common Stock or Basic Common Stock, as the case may be, is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. The shares of Holdings Common Stock constituting part of the Merger Consideration, at Holdings option, shall be Holdings Book-Entry Shares, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of Basic Common Stock or Grey Wolf Common Stock. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Holdings Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or any Uncertificated Shares not transferred with respect to the shares of Holdings Common Stock issuable upon surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Uncertificated Share as a result of the conversion provided in this _Article 2_ until such Certificate is surrendered or Uncertificated Share is transferred as provided herein. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name such shares of Holdings Common Stock have been registered, (i) promptly after the time of such 

   ##### 

  

    

surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.11_ and
the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and paid prior to the time of such surrender or transfer
with respect to such shares of Holdings Common Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to the
time of such surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to the
time of such surrender or transfer payable with respect to such shares
of Holdings Common Stock. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, (i) there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Grey Wolf of the shares of Grey Wolf Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Basic of the shares of Basic Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Holdings, the presented Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for shares of Holdings Common Stock, the Basic Cash Consideration or the Grey Wolf Cash Consideration, as the case may be, and cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends or distributions, if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article 2_. 

  

 (e) No fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to this Agreement. All fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock that a holder of shares of Basic Common Stock or Grey Wolf Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Mergers shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest equal to such fraction of a share of Holdings Common Stock multiplied by the closing sale price of a share of Holdings Common Stock on the NYSE on the first trading day immediately following the Effective Time. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any certificates for shares of Holdings Common Stock) that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of Grey Wolf or Basic one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdings. Any former stockholders of Grey Wolf or Basic who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.11_ shall thereafter look only to Holdings for their shares of Holdings Common Stock, their Basic Cash Consideration or Grey Wolf Cash Consideration, as the case may be, and cash in lieu of fractional shares and for any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, on the shares of Holdings Common Stock deliverable to such former stockholder pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (g) None of Holdings, Basic, Grey Wolf, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person for any portion of the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Holdings, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Holdings may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with 

   ##### 

  

    

respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shares of Holdings Common Stock,
the Basic Cash Consideration or Grey Wolf Cash Consideration, as the case may
be, and cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends
and distributions, if any, on shares of Holdings Common Stock, as provided in
_Section 2.11(c)_, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement. 

  

 (i) If any portion of the Basic Merger Consideration or the Grey Wolf Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 Section 2.12 Adjustment of Exchange Ratios. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (and in each case, as permitted by _Section 5.2_), the outstanding shares of Basic Common Stock or the outstanding shares of Grey Wolf Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the applicable Basic Merger Consideration or Grey Wolf Merger Consideration (and as a result, the Basic Adjustment Fraction and the Grey Wolf Adjustment Fraction) shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Basic Common Stock or Grey Wolf Common Stock, as the case may be, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 Section 2.13 Withholding. Each of Holdings and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person pursuant to this _Article 2_ such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment (including withholding shares of Holdings Common Stock). Any such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 Section 3.7 SEC Documents. 

  

 (a) Grey Wolf has filed with the SEC all documents required to be so filed by it since January 1, 2007 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and has made available to Basic each registration statement, periodic or other report, proxy statement or information statement (other than preliminary materials) it has so filed, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the " _Grey Wolf Reports_ "). As used in this _Section 3.7_, the term "file" shall include any reports on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC. As of its respective date or, if amended by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing, each Grey Wolf Report complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, SOX and the rules and regulations thereunder and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Grey Wolf Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Grey Wolf and the Grey Wolf Subsidiaries as of its date, and 

   ##### 

  

    

each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Grey
Wolf Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents
in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
stockholders equity, as the case may be, of Grey Wolf and the Grey Wolf
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (such consolidated balance
sheets and consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity, each including the notes and schedules thereto, the "
_Grey Wolf Financial Statements_ "). The Grey Wolf Financial Statements (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC and (ii) were prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
in the Grey Wolf Financial Statements or as permitted by Form 10-Q or Form
8-K. 

  

 (b) Grey Wolf has not entered into or modified any loans or arrangements with its officers and directors in violation of Section 402 of SOX. Grey Wolf has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Grey Wolfs disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Grey Wolf in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the management of Grey Wolf as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of SOX.

 (c) Since January 1, 2007, to the knowledge of Grey Wolf, neither Grey Wolf nor any of the Grey Wolf Subsidiaries nor any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Grey Wolf or any of the Grey Wolf Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or Claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Grey Wolf or any of the Grey Wolf Subsidiaries, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or Claim that Grey Wolf or any of the Grey Wolf Subsidiaries has a "material weakness" (as such terms are defined in the Public Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard No. 2, as in effect on the date hereof), in Grey Wolfs internal controls over financial reporting.

As used in this _Section 4.7_, the term "file" shall include any reports on Form 8-K 

    ##### 

   

    

furnished to the SEC. As of its respective date or, if amended by a subsequent
filing prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing, each Basic
Report complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act, SOX and the rules and regulations thereunder and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Basic Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Basic and the Basic Subsidiaries as of its date, and
each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Basic
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
stockholders equity, as the case may be, of Basic and the Basic Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein (such consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders
equity, each including the notes and schedules thereto, the " _Basic
Financial Statements_ "). The Basic Financial Statements (i) complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the

Basics disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Basic in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the management of Basic as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of SOX. The management of Basic has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of Basics internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the year ended December 31, 2007, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the knowledge of Basic, it has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluations, to Basics outside auditors and the audit committee of the Basic Board (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and any material weaknesses, which have more than a remote chance to materially adversely affect Basics ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) and (ii) any fraud, regardless of whether material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Basics internal controls over financial reporting. 

   

 (c) Since January 1, 2007, to the knowledge of Basic, neither Basic nor any of the Basic Subsidiaries nor any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Basic or any of the Basic Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or Claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Basic or any of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Basic Subsidiaries, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
Claim that Basic or any of the Basic Subsidiaries has a "material weakness"

Auditing Standard No. 2, as in effect on the date hereof), in Basics
internal controls over financial reporting.

 Section 4.9 Absence of Certain Changes.

the stockholders of Basic under Applicable Law (Y) in the case of a Basic

 (b) Each of Basic and Grey Wolf shall furnish the other Party with such information and reasonable assistance as such other Party and its respective affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any Regulatory Filings with any Governmental Authorities;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the provisions of the HSR Act would prevent a Party from disclosing such information to the other Party, then such information may be disclosed to such Partys counsel. 

   

 (c) Each of Basic and Grey Wolf shall take, or cause to be taken, all action or shall do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or desirable to cause the covenants and conditions applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby to be performed or satisfied as soon as practicable, including responding promptly to requests for additional information made by the DOJ or the FTC, and to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after the date of filing. 

   

 (d) Each of Basic and Grey Wolf shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, Order, ruling or injunction that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Furthermore, if any Governmental Authority shall have

issued any Order, decree, ruling or injunction, or taken any other action,
that would have the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting, delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Basic and Grey Wolf shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have such Order, decree, ruling or injunction or other action
declared ineffective as soon as practicable. 

   

 (e) Basic and Grey Wolf shall promptly notify each other of any communication concerning this Agreement or the Mergers from any Governmental Authority and, subject to Applicable Law, permit the other Party to review in advance any proposed communication to any Governmental Authority concerning this Agreement or the Mergers. In addition, Basic and Grey Wolf shall not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or another inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Mergers, or enter into any agreements with any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, extending any antitrust waiting periods, unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Basic and Grey Wolf shall furnish counsel to the other Party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authorities or members of their respective staffs on the other hand, relating to this Agreement and the Mergers. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to require Basic, Grey Wolf or Holdings or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to dispose of any of its assets or to limit its freedom of action with respect to any of their businesses, or to consent to any disposition of their assets or limits on their freedom of action with respect to any of their businesses, whether prior to or after the Effective Time, or to commit or agree to any of the foregoing, to obtain any consents, approvals, permits or authorizations or to remove any impediments to the Mergers relating to the HSR Act, or other antitrust, competition, pre-merger notification, trade regulation or similar Applicable Laws (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding relating to Antitrust Laws or non-U.S. Antitrust Laws, other than such dispositions, limitations or consents, commitments or agreements that in each such case may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby and that in each such case, individually or in the aggregate, do not have or cause and would not be reasonably be expected to have or cause a Material Adverse Effect on Holdings after the Mergers;  _provided, however,_ that neither Basic on the one hand or Grey Wolf and Holdings on the other hand shall take or agree to any action required or permitted by this _Section 5.9(f)_ without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 Section 5.10 Rule 16b-3 Approval. Prior to the Closing, Basic, Grey Wolf and Holdings, and their respective Boards of Directors or committees thereof, shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to take all actions to cause any dispositions of Grey Wolf Common Stock or Basic Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Grey Wolf Common Stock or Basic Common Stock) or acquisitions of Holdings Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Holdings Common Stock) resulting from the 

   ##### 

  

 

transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in no-
action letters issued by the SEC in similar transactions. 

   

 Section 5.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take all actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Mergers under the TBCA and the DGCL as promptly as commercially practicable. In addition, the Parties agree to execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, real estate and other property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Basic or Grey Wolf, the officers and directors of Holdings are fully authorized, in the name of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action. 

  

 Section 5.12 Public Announcements. On the date this Agreement is executed (or if executed after the close of business, no later than the first to occur of the opening of the NYSE or AMEX on the next day), Basic and Grey Wolf shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby. Except in respect of a public announcement as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any regulatory body, national securities exchange or association, Basic and Grey Wolf shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.13 Notification of Certain Matters. Each Party shall give prompt notice to the others of any of the following for which it becomes aware: (i) any representation or warranty made by it becoming untrue or inaccurate if such untruth or inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in _Article 6_ not to be satisfied, (ii) the occurrence of any event or development that would cause (or would reasonably be expected to cause) any representation or warranty by it herein to be untrue or inaccurate if such untruth or inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in _Article 6_ not to be satisfied, or (iii) any failure by it to comply with or satisfy in all material respects any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided, however,_ that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any Party hereto. 

  

 Section 5.14 Payment of Expenses. Whether or not the Mergers are consummated, and except as provided in _Section 7.3_, each Party shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of whether the Mergers are consummated, except that Basic and Grey Wolf shall equally share the following: (a) all fees and expenses, other than attorneys, accountants, financial advisers and consultants fees and expenses (which shall be paid by the Party incurring same), incurred in relation to the filing with the SEC and printing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including preliminary materials related thereto, and the 

   ##### 

  

 

Registration Statement, including financial statements and exhibits and any
amendments and supplements thereto, (b) the filing fees for the Registration

under the HSR Act, (c) the fees and expenses (other than attorneys
fees) associated with the NYSE listing application referred to in _Section
5.8_ above, (d) all costs and expenses of negotiating, documenting and
obtaining the Holdings Credit Facilities (and borrowings thereunder)
including the fees and expenses of the lenders and the fees and expenses
of the lenders attorneys in connection therewith, but excluding fees and
expenses of Basics and Grey Wolfs attorneys in connection therewith, and
(e) the costs and expenses (but not attorneys fees) incurred by Holdings in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 5.15 Indemnification and Insurance. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Holdings shall subject to Applicable Law: honor all indemnification, advancement and expenses and exculpation agreements or other obligations of Basic and Grey Wolf with respect to their respective current or former officers and directors including those agreements or obligations included in the Basic Charter Documents, the Grey Wolf Charter Documents, and any Contract of Basic or Grey Wolf with their respective current or former officers or directors, or arising under Applicable Law. 

   

 (b) From and for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Holdings shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and advance expenses to each person who is now, has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director, employee, controlling stockholder or agent (including a trustee or fiduciary of a Basic Benefit Plan or Grey Wolf Benefit Plan) of any of the Basic Companies or Grey Wolf Companies (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law against all losses, expenses (including reasonable outside attorneys fees), claims, damages, fines, costs, liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) resulting from, or otherwise arising in connection with, any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, the fact that the Indemnified Party (or the Person controlled by the Indemnified Party) is or was a director, officer, employee, controlling stockholder or agent (including a trustee or fiduciary of any Basic Benefit Plan or Grey Wolf Benefit Plan) of any of the Basic Companies or the Grey Wolf Companies and pertaining to any matter existing, or arising out of actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time (including any Claim arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Holdings shall pay any expenses to each Indemnified Party, as incurred, in advance of the final disposition of any such Claim to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to receive such advances from Holdings within ten Business Days of receipt by Holdings from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by Applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) Holdings shall have the right to control the defense of such matter with Holdings regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel selected by Holdings and reasonably 

   ##### 

  

   

satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and Holdings shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel; and (ii) the Indemnified Party will
cooperate with Holdings, at Holdings expense, in the defense of any such
matter. Holdings shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any Claim for which indemnification could be sought by any
Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Claim and does not include any finding of fact
admission or stipulation with respect to fault, intent or culpability of the
Indemnified Party, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents. In the event
of any Claim, any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification shall
promptly notify Holdings thereof ( _provided_ that failure to so
notify Holdings will not affect the obligations of Holdings except to the
extent that Holdings shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of
such failure) and shall deliver to Holdings any undertaking required by
Applicable Law, but without any requirement for the posting of a
bond. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Claim is brought
against any of the Indemnified Parties, Holdings shall be required to retain
only one counsel (plus one local counsel, if necessary) to represent all such
Indemnified Parties with respect to each such matter unless the use of one
counsel to represent the Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest, or the representation of all of the Indemnified
Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or apparent
differing interests between them, in which case such additional counsel as
may be required (as shall be reasonably determined by the Indemnified
Parties and Holdings) may be retained by the Indemnified Parties at the cost
and expense of Holdings and Holdings shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section 5.15_ shall be deemed to grant
any right to any Indemnified Party which is not permitted to be granted to an
officer, director, employee, controlling stockholder or agent of Basic or
Grey Wolf under a non-waivable provision of Applicable Law. 

   

 (c) From and for not less than six years after the Effective Time, Holdings shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance policies covering those persons who are covered by Basics and Grey Wolfs respective directors and officers respective liability insurance policies as of the Effective Time on terms substantially no less advantageous to such Persons than such existing insurance with respect to Claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Holdings may substitute therefor policies, issued by an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Grey Wolfs and Basics current insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous than Grey Wolfs and Basics current policy, _provided_ that such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) Holdings shall not be required to pay an annual premium in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by Grey Wolf or Basic (whichever premium was higher) prior to the date hereof. In the event that the annual premium for such insurance exceeds such maximum amount, Holdings shall purchase as much coverage per policy year as reasonably obtainable for such maximum amount. 

   

 (d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive 

   ##### 

  

   

of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether
pursuant to Applicable Law, Contract or otherwise. 

   

 (e) In the event that Holdings, or any of its respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its and its subsidiaries properties and assets (taken as a whole) to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made by Holdings so that the successors and assigns of Holdings, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.15_. 

   

 Section 5.16 Holdings Employee Matters. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall continue employment of all the employees who are employed by Basic or any of its Subsidiaries as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and all of the employees who are employed by Grey Wolf or any of its Subsidiaries as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Basic Employees and Grey Wolf Employees so employed are collectively referred to herein as the " _Continuing Employees._ " 

   

 (b) During the period from the Effective Time to and including December 31, 2008, Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall provide each Continuing Employee with an annual salary rate, bonus opportunity and hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is not less favorable to such Continuing Employee than the annual salary rate, bonus arrangements or hourly wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee by Basic or Grey Wolf, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) During the period from the Effective Time to and including December 31, 2008, Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall provide medical, dental, pharmaceutical and vision benefits and other employee benefits that (i) with respect to Basic Employees shall be no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided by Basic or the Basic Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) with respect to Grey Wolf Employees shall be, no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided by Grey Wolf or the Grey Wolf Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall require Holdings to provide or continue any stock option plans, restricted stock grant plans or other equity award or purchase plans of either Basic or Grey Wolf, except as otherwise provided in  _Article 2_ hereof, or to assume or provide retiree medical benefits to any Continuing Employee, except as described in _Section 5.16_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (d) With respect to each Continuing Employee, Holdings shall credit, or cause its Subsidiaries to credit, the period of employment and service recognized by the applicable employer (including its affiliates and their predecessors if so recognized by the employer) for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of Holdings corresponding benefit plans, programs, policies or similar employment-related arrangements to have been employment and service with Holdings or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining the Continuing Employees eligibility to join (subject to satisfaction of all non-service related eligibility criteria), vesting and benefit accrual (but not benefit accrual for any purpose other than vacation pay, severance and termination pay and sick leave, and vesting in employer 

   ##### 

  

   

contributions under a 401(k) or profit sharing arrangement that is tax
qualified under Code Section 401) under all employee benefit plans, programs,
policies or similar employment-related arrangements of Holdings and
its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee is eligible to participate.
No such period of employment and service credit shall be provided to the
extent that it will result in a duplication of credit or employment
benefits. 

   

 (e) Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall waive, and the extent necessary to effect the terms hereof, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the relevant insurance carriers and other third parties to waive, any restrictions and limitations for medical conditions existing as of the Effective Time of each Continuing Employee and the Continuing Employees dependents who are covered immediately prior to the Effective Time under a group health plan maintained by Basic or Grey Wolf, as the case may be, but only to the extent such pre-existing medical condition would have been covered by Holdings group health plan if it were not a pre-existing medical condition and only to the extent that such pre-existing medical condition limitations would not have applied to such Continuing Employee or the Continuing Employees dependents (as the case may be) under Basics or Grey Wolfs group health plan, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time. Additionally, Holdings shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to offer, or cause its Subsidiaries to offer, at the Effective Time to each Continuing Employee coverage under a group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) which credits such Continuing Employee towards the deductibles, co-insurance and maximum out of pocket provisions imposed under such group health plan, for the year during which the Effective Time (or such later date as the Continuing Employee participates in such group health plan) occurs, with any applicable expenses already incurred during such year under Basics or Grey Wolfs group health plan, as the case may be. 

   

 (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered a contract between Basic, Grey Wolf, Holdings, or any of their respective Subsidiaries and any Continuing Employee or consideration for, or inducement with respect to, any such Continuing Employees continued employment with Holdings and, without limitation, all such Continuing Employees are and will continue to be considered employees at will pursuant to the applicable employment at will laws or doctrine, subject to any express written agreement to the contrary with such Continuing Employee. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the generality of _Section 8.6_, nothing in this _Section 5.16_ is intended to make any Person a third-party beneficiary of the agreements contained in this _Section 5.16_, and nothing in this _Section 5.16_ shall constitute an amendment of any Basic Benefit Plan or Grey Wolf Benefit Plan. 

   

 (g) The Parties agree that Holdings shall establish a severance plan and an employee retention plan prior to the Effective Time, each having terms generally summarized in _Section 5.16(g)_ to the Basic Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (h) Each of the Parties agree to cooperate in good faith prior to the Effective Time to establish a process to integrate the Basic Benefit Plans and the Grey Wolf Benefit Plans following the Effective Time. 

   

 (i) Each of the Parties agree that the initial organizational chart of Holdings and the job descriptions for the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and chief operating officer of Holdings shall be as set forth in _Section 5.16(i)_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (j) Each of the Parties agree to recommend that their respective stockholders approve, and use commercially reasonable efforts to seek their respective stockholders approval of, the Holdings Plan, in the substantially the form attached as _Section 5.16(j)_ to the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter. If the Basic Plan Proposal is approved by the stockholders of Basic and the Grey Wolf Plan Proposal is approved by the stockholders of Grey Wolf, Holdings shall cause the Basic Stock Plans and the Grey Wolf Stock Plans to be frozen as of the Effective Time and no future awards shall be made from those plans and the awards outstanding under each of the Basic Stock Plans and the Grey Wolf Stock Plans shall be adjusted as provided in _Article 2_. 

   

 Section 5.17 Basic Employee Matters. 

  

 (a) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the Mergers will constitute a "Change in Control" or "Change of Control" of Basic under each of the executive employment agreements of Basic described in _Section 5.17_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter and awards granted under the Basic 2003 Plan and unvested employer contributions to the Brown Deferred Compensation Plan; _provided,_ with respect to any awards issued under the Basic 2003 Plan to directors of Basic who will be Continuing Directors of Holdings following the consummation of the Mergers, Basic shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to cause such Continuing Directors to waive any rights to vesting based on the "Change of Control" or "Change in Control" that may otherwise be deemed to have occurred as a result of the Mergers. 

   

 (b) Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Basic and each of Kenneth V. Huseman and Alan Krenek shall enter into amendments to their respective employment agreements with Basic, for no or nominal consideration, each to become effective as of the Effective Time and each to be in substantially the form included in _Section 5.17_ of the Basic Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (c) Basic may amend any of its employment agreements to amend the "Change in Control" definition to amend or add any items consistent with the definitions of "Change of Control" in the Grey Wolf employment agreements in the forms included in _Section 5.18(a)_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter. 

   

 Section 5.18 Grey Wolf Employee Matters. 

  

 (a) Grey Wolf will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and to cause each of its officers with whom it has an employment agreement that is described in _Section 5.18(a)_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter to, enter into amendments to their respective employment agreements with Grey Wolf each to become effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and each to be in substantially the form included in _Section 5.18(a)_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter. The commercially reasonable efforts to be used by Grey Wolf to cause the amended employment agreements to be signed by its officers will not require Grey Wolf to terminate or threaten to terminate any such officer or take any action that might reasonably constitute a "Constructive Termination Without Cause" as defined in the officers current employment agreements. 

   

 (b) Grey Wolf will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and to cause each of its employees who are participants in its Executive Severance Plan to, enter into 

   ##### 

  

   

amendments to the Executive Severance Plan with Grey Wolf each to become
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and each to be in
substantially the form included in _Section 5.18(b)_ of the Grey
Wolf Disclosure Letter. The commercially reasonable efforts to be used by
Grey Wolf to cause the amended Executive Severance Plan to be signed by its
employees will not require Grey Wolf to terminate or threaten to terminate
any such employee or take any action that might reasonably constitute a
"Qualifying Termination" as defined in the Executive Severance Plan. 

   

 (c) Grey Wolf will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and to cause each of the individuals with whom it has a restricted stock award agreement to, enter into amendments to their respective restricted stock award agreement with Grey Wolf each to become effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and each to be in substantially the form included in _Section 5.18(c)_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter. The commercially reasonable efforts to be used by Grey Wolf to cause the amended restricted stock award agreements to be signed by such individuals will not require Grey Wolf to terminate or threaten to terminate any such employee or take any action that might reasonably constitute a "constructive termination without Cause" as defined in any employment agreement between Grey Wolf and the individual or a "Qualifying Termination" as defined in the Executive Severance Plan. 

   

 (d) Grey Wolf will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and to cause each of the individuals with whom it has a Non-Qualified Option Agreement to, enter into amendments to their respective Non-Qualified Option Agreement with Grey Wolf each to become effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and each to be in substantially the form included in _Section 5.18(d)_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter. The commercially reasonable efforts to be used by Grey Wolf to cause the amended Non-Qualified Option Agreements to be signed by such individuals will not require Grey Wolf to terminate or threaten to terminate any such employee or take any action that might reasonably constitute a "constructive termination without Cause" as defined in any employment agreement between Grey Wolf and the individual or a "Qualifying Termination" as defined in the Executive Severance Plan. 

   

 (e) Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Grey Wolf and the Chairman of Grey Wolfs Board of Directors shall enter into a consulting agreement to become effective at the Effective Time in substantially the form included in _Section 5.18(e)_ of the Grey Wolf Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (f) Grey Wolf shall cause all vesting and other restrictions on Grey Wolf Restricted Stock owned by each current director who will not become a Continuing Director to be terminated at the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 5.19 Tax Matters. 

  

 (a) Basic, Grey Wolf and Holdings shall each use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause each Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in _Section 6.2(d) _and _Section 6.3(d)_. Basic, Grey Wolf and Holdings agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of each Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Code. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sec. 1.368-2(g). 

   

 (b) Basic shall deliver to Andrews Kurth LLP and Porter and Hedges, L.L.P. an officers certificate dated as of the Closing Date and signed by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Basic, containing representations of Basic, and Grey Wolf shall deliver to Porter and Hedges, L.L.P. and Andrews Kurth LLP an officers certificate dated as of the Closing Date and signed by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Grey Wolf, containing representations of Grey Wolf, in each case as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Andrews Kurth LLP to render the opinion described in _Section 6.2(d)_ of this Agreement and Porter and Hedges, L.L.P. to render the opinion described in _Section 6.3(d)_ of this Agreement. Each of Basic, Grey Wolf and Holdings shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the officers certificates described in this _Section 5.19_. 

   

 (c) Basic and Grey Wolf shall each provide Holdings with a certification in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) that it is not a United States real property holding corporation. 

   

 (d) The Parties intend and believe that this Agreement constitutes a binding Contract for fixed consideration pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1T(e)(2). 

   

 Section 5.20 Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Stockholders Meeting; No Other Vote. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the obligations of Basic or Grey Wolf (as the case may be) to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Basic Meeting or Grey Wolf Meeting (as applicable) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Basic Acquisition Proposal or Grey Wolf Acquisition Proposal with respect to it, or by any determination by the Basic Board or Grey Wolf Board (as the case may be) to modify, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the Mergers. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 7.1_, neither Basic nor Grey Wolf shall submit to the vote of its stockholders any Basic Acquisition Proposal or Grey Wolf Acquisition Proposal (as the case may be), or propose to do so. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.20_ shall in any way limit the ability of Grey Wolf to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_ or Basic to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_. 

  

 Section 5.21 Control of Other Partys Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Grey Wolf, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Basics operations or give Basic, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Grey Wolfs operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Basic and Grey Wolf shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective operations. 

    ##### 

  

 

 Section 5.22 The Financing. 

  

 (a) Grey Wolf will use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter. Each of Grey Wolf and Basic will use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to enter into and to cause Holdings and each of the Subsidiaries of Grey Wolf or Basic, as the case may be, to enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions reflected in the Commitment Letter; (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to it and to Holdings in such definitive agreements no later than the Closing; and (iii) to consummate the Financing no later than the Closing. If any Party becomes aware that the Financing is not available to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then that Party shall promptly notify each of the other Parties, and each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and each of the other Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other Parties in obtaining, alternative financing on terms (taken in the aggregate) that are no less favorable to Holdings than those set forth in the Commitment Letter and in an amount (when added to cash of Basic and Grey Wolf forecast to be on hand immediately prior to the Mergers) that is adequate to pay the Basic Cash Consideration and the Grey Wolf Cash Consideration and all fees and expenses associated with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to make any other payments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Alternative Financing_ "). 

   

 (b) Each Party shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, legal counsel, accountants and other agents of it and each of its Subsidiaries to provide, all cooperation in connection with the Parties efforts to obtain the Financing or the Alternative Financing as may reasonably be requested by any of the other Parties or by the Joint Lead Arrangers, including, without limitation, (i) participating on a timely basis in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and other presentations, including presentations with potential lenders and with rating agencies; (ii) furnishing to the Joint Lead Arrangers and to each other Party as promptly as reasonably practicable all financial statements, pro forma statements, financial projections, business plans, budgets and other reasonably pertinent data and information as may be available (or obtainable without unreasonable expense) and reasonably requested by either of the Joint Lead Arrangers; (iii) participating in the marketing presentations and other marketing efforts of the Joint Lead Arrangers for any portion of the Financing or the Alternative Financing and assisting the Joint Lead Arrangers in the timely preparation of bank information memoranda, presentations and similar documents and of material for rating agency presentations; (iv) being responsible for, and indemnifying the Joint Lead Arrangers and each other Party against, liability, cost or expense with respect to any financial or other information provided by such Party for incorporation into any such memoranda, documents or material; (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, including to obtain and provide opinions of counsel, corporate approvals of the transactions contemplated by the Financing or the Alternative Financing and certifications with respect to such approvals and other matters as may reasonably be required by either of the Joint Lead Arrangers and customary payoff letters in respect of any indebtedness required to be repaid at Closing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Joint Lead Arrangers, including specification of all amounts required to be repaid in order to discharge fully at Closing all liabilities with respect to such indebtedness and all related obligations and commitments under any Contract relating thereto and to obtain releases at the Closing of all Liens granted to secure any such indebtedness, obligations or commitments; (vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain legal opinions, ratings and 

   ##### 

  

   

other documentation and items relating to such financing as are reasonably
requested by either of the Joint Lead Arrangers; (vii) executing and
delivering any guarantees, mortgages, pledge and security documents, other
definitive financing documents or other certificates, legal opinions or
documents as may be reasonably requested by either of the Joint Lead
Arrangers; and (viii) taking such actions and providing such information and
assistance as either of the Joint Lead Arrangers may reasonably request in
connection with creating Liens upon or pledging collateral to secure the
Financing or the Alternative Financing. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that either the Basic Merger or the Grey Wolf Merger is not consummated due to the failure to obtain the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) no Party shall have any liability to any other party arising out of such failure, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not relieve Grey Wolf or Basic, as the case may be, of its obligations under _Section 5.22(a)_ or _Section 5.22(b)_, respectively. Each Party acknowledges that (i) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no other Party is intended to have any greater risk or liability with respect to any failure to obtain the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) and (ii) no other Party would have entered into this Agreement but for the agreement of the Parties set forth in this _Section 5.22_. 

   

 Section 5.23 Obligations of Holdings. Grey Wolf and Basic shall each take all action necessary to cause Holdings to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Financing, any Alternative Financing and the Mergers on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

    

       wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Basic a termination fee in the amount of $30.0 million.

 (b) Grey Wolf will, immediately upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ , pay, or cause to be paid, to Basic by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Basic $5.0 million as a reasonable estimate of Basics expenses;  _provided_ that no amount shall be payable under this _Section 7.3(b)_ if the termination fee is paid pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_.

 (d) Basic will, immediately upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 7.1(c)(iii)_ , _7.1(d)(iv)_ or _7.1(b)(iv)_ (but in the case of _Section 7.1(b)(iv)_ only if prior to such Basic Meeting a Basic Adverse Recommendation Change or a Basic Acquisition Proposal Recommendation has been made), pay, or cause to be paid, to Grey Wolf by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Grey Wolf a termination fee in the amount of $30.0 million.

 (f) Basic will pay, or cause to be paid, to Grey Wolf a termination fee in the amount of $30.0 million (less the amount of the payment, if any, previously made by Basic pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_ ) if (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or  _7.1(b)(iv)_ , (ii) prior to such termination, there has been publicly announced a Basic Acquisition Proposal and (iii) within 365 days of such termination, any Basic Company enters into any definitive agreement with respect to or consummates any Basic Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether such Basic Acquisition Proposal is the same Basic Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (ii) above); _provided_ that no amount shall be payable under this _Section 7.3(f)_ if the termination fee is paid pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_. Such termination fee shall be paid on the day 

   ##### 

  

   

such Basic Company consummates such Basic Acquisition Proposal, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designed by Grey Wolf.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Basic shall not be required to pay, or cause
to be paid, to Grey Wolf any amounts pursuant to this  _Section 7.3(f)_ if
the reason the Mergers have not been timely consummated is as the result of a
failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1(b)_, _6.1(c)_
,  _6.1(d)_ , _6.1(e)_ or _6.1(f)_. 

   

 (g) Grey Wolf acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Basic would not have entered into this Agreement.

     ##### 

 

   

Exhibit 2.3(a) 

   

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
 OF 
 GREY WOLF, INC. 

   

 FIRST: The name of the corporation is Grey Wolf, Inc. (hereinafter called the " _ _Corporation__ "). 

  

 SECOND: The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is 615 South Dupont Highway, Dover, Kent County, Delaware 19901. The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such address is Capitol Services, Inc. 

  

 THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as from time to time amended. 

  

 FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 300,000,000, of which 10,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, and 290,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. 

  

 A. Preferred Stock. (1) Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series without further stockholder approval and in such amounts as may be determined by the Board of Directors. The voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, of the Preferred Stock of each series shall be such as are fixed by the Board of Directors, authority so to do being hereby expressly granted, and as are stated and expressed in a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series of Preferred Stock (herein called the " _ _Directors  Resolution__"). Without limitation, such Directors Resolution may (i) fix the number of shares of such series that may be issued, (ii) provide for a sinking fund for the purchase or redemption of shares of such series and specify the terms and conditions governing the operations of any such fund, (iii) grant voting rights, full or limited, to the holders of shares of such series, or provide that such shares shall have no voting rights, or provide that such shares may have more or less than one vote per share on some or all matters, (iv) provide for fixed, variable or contingent dividends and impose conditions or restrictions upon the payment of dividends upon, or the making of other distributions to, or the acquisition of, shares ranking junior to the Preferred Stock or to any series thereof with respect to dividends or distributions of assets upon liquidation, (v) state the time or times, the price or prices or the rate or rates of exchange and other terms, conditions and adjustments upon which shares of any such series may be made convertible into, or exchangeable for, at the option of the holder or the Corporation or upon the occurrence of a specified event, shares of any other class or classes or of any other series of Preferred Stock or any other class or classes of stock or other securities of the Corporation, and (vi) grant such other special rights and impose such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors, to the extent not inconsistent with this Article FOURTH and to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (2) Except as expressly required by law, or except as may be provided in any Directors Resolution, the Preferred Stock shall have no right or power to vote on any question or in any proceeding or to be represented at, or to receive notice of, any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. 

  

 (3) Preferred Stock that is redeemed or purchased by the Corporation shall be retired by the Corporation if so provided in the Directors Resolution and, if not so provided, may be retired by the Corporation upon a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors, and upon any such retirement, the Preferred Stock shall assume the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock without designation as to series and may thereafter, subject to the provisions of any Directors Resolution providing for the issue of any particular series of Preferred Stock, be reissued in the same manner as authorized but previously unissued Preferred Stock. 

  

 B. Common Stock. All shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation shall be identical and except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in the Directors Resolution or resolutions, if any, adopted by the Board of Directors with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power, and each share of Common Stock shall have one vote. 

  

 FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the regulation of certain stockholder action matters and with respect to certain voting rights applicable to the Corporations capital stock: 

  

 A. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. 

  

 B. Except as otherwise required in a Directors Resolution with respect to a series of Preferred Stock or by applicable law, (i) no stockholder shall have any right of cumulative voting and (ii) each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. 

  

 SIXTH: The following provisions are inserted for certain matters relating to the Board of Directors: 

  

 A. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by statute or by this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation 

  

 B. The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the term " _ _Whole Board__ " shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships. 

   ##### 

  

  

 C. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III. Each director shall serve for a term expiring on the third annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting stockholders at which such director was elected; provided, however, that the directors designated at the Effective Time (as defined in this Article SIXTH) pursuant to the Merger Agreement (as defined in this Article SIXTH) shall serve the following term: the directors designated to Class I shall serve for a term expiring on the Corporations first annual meeting of stockholders after the Effective Time, the directors designated to Class II shall serve for a term expiring on the Corporations second annual meeting of stockholders after the Effective Time and the directors designated to Class III shall serve for a term expiring on the Corporations third annual meeting of stockholders after the Effective Time. Each director shall hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders at which the directors term expires and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall serve until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, designation or removal. The number of directors in each class shall be the whole number contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the authorized number of directors by three, and if a fraction is also contained in such quotient then if such fraction is one-third (1/3), the extra director shall be a member of Class I, and if the fraction is two-thirds (2/3), one of the extra directors shall be a member of Class I and the other member of Class II. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he is a member and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of Directors among the three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than one director more than any other class. To the extent possible, consistent with the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation, and any newly eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the number of directors comprising the Whole Board shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. 

  

 D. In accordance with the Merger Agreement (as defined below), effective as of the Effective Time (as defined below), the Board of Directors shall consist of nine directors: four Brown Directors (as defined below) and five Green Directors (as defined below). At the Effective Time: Class I shall consist of two Green Directors and one Brown Director; Class II shall consist of two Brown Directors and one Green Director; and Class III shall consist of two Green Directors and one Brown Director. In the event of the death, removal or resignation of a Brown Director prior to  _ _, 2009 (the date one year after the date of this Certificate of Incorporation), the remaining Brown Directors shall be constituted as a committee to designate an individual to fill such vacancy. In the event of the death, removal or resignation of a Green Director prior to  _ _, 2009 (the date one year after the date of this Certificate of Incorporation), the remaining Green Directors shall be constituted as a committee to designate an individual to fill such vacancy. 

  

 "Brown Director" means each of those four individuals designated by Brown to serve as members of the Board of Directors as of the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement (which granted Brown a contractual right to designate such directors). 

   ##### 

  

  

 "Effective Time" has the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 "Merger Agreement" means the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 20, 2008, by and among Brown, Green and the Corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time, a copy of which shall be made available to any stockholder upon request. 

  

 "Green Director" means each of those five individuals designated by Green to serve as members of the Board of Directors as of the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement (which granted Green a contractual right to designate such directors). 

  

 E. At each annual election, directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be of the same class as the directors they succeed unless, by reason of any intervening changes in the authorized number of directors, the Board of Directors shall designate one or more directorships whose term then expires as directorships of another class in order more nearly to achieve equality of number of directors among the classes. 

  

 F. In case any vacancy shall occur on the Board of Directors because of death, resignation or removal, such vacancy shall only be filled by a majority of the directors remaining in office (though less than a quorum) or by the sole remaining director, except for any vacancy in the Board of the Directors with respect to a Brown Director or a Green Director that occurs prior to  _ _, 2009 (the date one year after the date of this Certificate of Incorporation), which vacancy shall be filled in the manner described in Clause D of this Article SIXTH. The director so appointed shall serve for the unexpired term of his predecessor or until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. If there are no directors then in office, an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by applicable law. Any newly-created directorship shall only be filled by a majority of the directors then in office (though less than a quorum), or by the sole remaining director. Each director so appointed shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. Except as expressly required by law, stockholders shall not have any right to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly-created directorships. 

  

 G. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article SIXTH, if Directors Resolutions creating any series of Preferred Stock entitle the holders of such preferred stock, voting separately by series, to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, then all provisions of such resolutions relating to the nomination, election, term of office, removal, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall, as to such directorships, govern and control over any conflicting provisions of this Article SIXTH. 

  

 H. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws so provide. 

  

 SEVENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this Certificate of Incorporation, the bylaws of the Corporation, or imposed by Delaware law in effect from time to time, bylaws of the Corporation may be altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board, but any bylaws adopted by the Board of Directors may be amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon as outlined in this Article SEVENTH. The bylaws of the Corporation may not be altered, amended or rescinded, nor may 

   ##### 

  

 

new bylaws be adopted, by the Stockholders except by the affirmative vote of
the holders of not less than 66-2/3% of all outstanding shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class. Election of directors need not be by written
ballot unless the bylaws so provide. 

   

 EIGHTH: To the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law in effect from time to time, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable either to the Corporation or to any stockholder for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Neither amendment nor repeal of this Article EIGHTH nor the adoption of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article EIGHTH shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article EIGHTH in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article EIGHTH, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of any inconsistent provision. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended. 

  

 NINTH: To the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law in effect from time to time, the Corporation shall indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, shall pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a threatened or pending proceeding to (a) any individual who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation and who was or is made a party, or was or is threatened to be made a party, to the proceeding by reason of his service in that capacity or (b) any individual who, while a director of the Corporation and at the request of the Corporation, serves or has served another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise as a director, officer, partner or trustee of such corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made a party to the proceeding by reason of his service in that capacity against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them. The Corporation may, with the approval of its Board of Directors, provide such indemnification and advance for expenses to a person who served a predecessor of the Corporation in any of the capacities described in (a) or (b) above and to any employee or agent of the Corporation or a predecessor of the Corporation. 

  

 The Corporation shall, as a condition to advancing expenses to a director or officer, obtain a written undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Corporation if it shall ultimately be determined that such persons are not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under Delaware law or any applicable contract. 

  

 Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article NINTH, nor the adoption or amendment of any other provision of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation inconsistent with this Article NINTH shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article NINTH in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article NINTH, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision. 

   ##### 

  

  

 The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether of not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article NINTH or otherwise. 

  

 TENTH: The Corporation is to have perpetual existence. 

  

 ELEVENTH: The vote of stockholders holding at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote generally in the election of directors shall be required to amend Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH or this Article ELEVENTH.

If no designation is made by the Board of Directors, the place of meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation. In addition, the Board of Directors may determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communications as authorized by these Bylaws. 

  

 Section 2.4. _Notice of Meetings_. (a) Except as otherwise required by law, written notice of each meeting of Stockholders shall be delivered to each Stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat, which notice shall (i) state the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which Stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at any such meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and (ii) be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. 

  

 (b) If any two successive notices addressed to a Stockholder at the address of such Stockholder appearing on the books of the Corporation is returned to the Corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the Stockholder at such address, all further notices to such Stockholder at such address shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available to such Stockholder upon written demand of such Stockholder at the principal executive office of the Corporation. 

  

 (c) Any previously scheduled meeting of the Stockholders may be postponed by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled for such meeting.

 Section 2.5. _Voting List_. At least 10 days before each meeting of Stockholders, the Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation who has charge of the Corporations stock ledger shall prepare a complete list of the Stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing, with respect to each Stockholder, his address and the number of shares registered in his name. Such list shall be open to the examination of any Stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the list is made available on an electronic network, then the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to Stockholders. If the meeting is to held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any Stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any Stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonable accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are the Stockholders entitled to examine any list required by this Section 2.5 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of Stockholders. 

  

 Section 2.6. _Quorum and Adjournment_. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the " _ _Voting Stock__ "), present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Stockholders, except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. Except as otherwise required by law, if a quorum is present at any meeting of Stockholders, such quorum shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough Stockholders to leave less than a quorum and the Stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of Stockholders, the holders of a majority of the voting stock represented at such meeting or any officer of the Corporation may adjourn such meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, the chairman of any meeting of Stockholders shall have the right, acting in his sole discretion, to adjourn such meeting from time to time. 

  

 Section 2.7. _Adjourned Meetings_. When a meeting of Stockholders is adjourned to another time or place, unless otherwise provided by these Bylaws, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which Stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; _provided, however_ , if an adjournment is for more than 30 days or if after an adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Stockholder entitled to vote thereat. At any adjourned meeting, the Stockholders entitled to vote thereat may transact any business which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. 

  

 Section 2.8. _Voting_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Election of directors at all meetings of Stockholders need not be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation; if authorized by the board of directors, such requirement of a written ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can determined that electronic transmission was authorized by the Stockholder or proxy holder. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all matters other than the election of directors submitted to the Stockholders at any meeting shall be decided by the vote of the holders of stock having a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter. 

  

 (b) Shares standing in the name of another corporation (whether domestic or foreign) may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine. Shares standing in the name of a deceased person may be voted by the executor or administrator of such deceased person, either in person or by proxy. Shares standing in the name of a guardian, conservator or trustee may be voted by such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy, but no fiduciary shall be entitled to vote shares held in such fiduciary capacity without a transfer of such shares into the name of such fiduciary. Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver. A Stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation he has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee (or his proxy) may represent the stock and vote thereon. 

  

 (c) If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the name of two or more persons (whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise) or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: 

   

 (i) if only one votes, his act binds all; 

   

 (ii) if more than one votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; and 

   

 (iii) if more than one votes but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionately or any person voting the shares, or a beneficiary, (if any) may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court as may have jurisdiction to appoint an additional person to act with the person so voting the shares, which shall then be voted as determined by a majority such persons and the person so appointed by the court. 

 

If the instrument so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal
interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of the paragraph (c)
shall be a majority or even-split in interest. 

    ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.9. _Proxies_. (a) At any meeting of Stockholders, each Stockholder having the right to vote thereat may be represented and vote either in person or by proxy executed in writing by such Stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. Each such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation at or before the beginning of each meeting at which such proxy is to be voted. Unless otherwise provided therein, no proxy shall be valid after three years from the date of its execution. Each proxy shall be revocable unless expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power or unless otherwise made irrevocable by applicable law. 

  

 (b) A proxy shall be deemed signed if the Stockholders name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, electronic transmission or otherwise) by the Stockholder or his attorney-in-fact. 

  

 (c) Except as otherwise required by applicable law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may, in advance of any meeting of Stockholders, prescribe additional regulations concerning the manner of execution and filing of proxies (and the validation of same) which may be voted at such meeting. 

  

 Section 2.10. _Record Date_. For the purpose of determining the Stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Stockholders (or any adjournment thereof) or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors or be more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed, (i) the record date for determining Stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and (ii) the record date for determining Stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of Stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; _provided, however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

  

 Section 2.11. _Conduct of Meetings; Agenda_. (a) Meetings of the Stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if one shall have been elected, or in the Chairmans absence or if one shall not have been elected, the person designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation, the vote of the majority of the directors present at such meeting. At each meeting of Stockholders, the Secretary (or in the Secretarys absence or inability to act, the person whom the chairman of the meeting shall appoint secretary of the meeting) shall act as secretary of the meeting. The order of business at each meeting of Stockholders shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him in order. 

  

 (b) The Board of Directors may, in advance of any meeting of Stockholders, adopt an agenda for such meeting, adherence to which the chairman of the meeting may enforce. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.12. _Inspectors of Election; Opening and Closing of Polls_. (a) Before any meeting of Stockholders, the Corporation may, and if required by law shall, appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of election at such meeting or any adjournment thereof. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting may, and if required by law or requested by any Stockholder entitled to vote or his proxy shall, appoint a substitute inspector. If no inspectors are appointed by the Corporation, the chairman of the meeting may, and if required by law shall, appoint one or more inspectors at the meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, inspectors shall be appointed consistent with the mandatory provisions of Section 231 of the DGCL. 

  

 (b) Inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities (including as officers, employees, agents or representatives); _provided, however_ , that no director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector. Inspectors need not be Stockholders. 

  

 (c) The inspectors shall (i) determine the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the validity and effect of proxies and (ii) receive votes or ballots, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes and ballots, determine the results and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all Stockholders. On request of the chairman of the meeting, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, request or matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any fact found by them. The inspectors shall have such other duties as may be prescribed by Section 231 of the DGCL. 

  

 (d) The chairman of the meeting may, and if required by the DGCL shall, fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the Stockholders will vote at the meeting. 

  

 Section 2.13. _Procedures for Bringing Business before Annual Meetings_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of Stockholders except in accordance with the procedures hereinafter set forth in this Section 2.13; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.13 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any Stockholder of any business properly brought before any annual meeting of Stockholders in accordance with such procedures. 

  

 (b) At any annual meeting of Stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) properly brought before the meeting by a Stockholder. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a Stockholder, the Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a Stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the Corporation not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days in advance of the first anniversary of the date of the Corporations proxy statement released to Stockholders in connection with the previous years 

   ##### 

  

 

annual meeting of Stockholders;  _provided, however_ , that if no annual
meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting of
Stockholders has been changed by more than 30 calendar days from the
date contemplated at the time of the previous years proxy statement, the
notice must be received by the Corporation no earlier than 150 days prior to
the date of the meeting and no later than the later of 120 days prior to the
date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which
public announcement of the meeting was first made. Any meeting of
Stockholders which is adjourned, for purposes of any Stockholders notice
contemplated by this paragraph (b), shall be deemed to be a continuation of
the original meeting, and no business may be brought before such adjourned
meeting by any Stockholder unless timely notice of such business was given to
the Secretary of the Corporation for the meeting as originally noticed. 

   

 (c) Each notice given by a Stockholder as contemplated by paragraph (b) above (other than a proposed nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director, which is addressed in Section 3.4) shall set forth, as to each matter the Stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) the nature of the proposed business with reasonable particularity, including the exact text of any proposal to be presented for adoption and any supporting statement, which proposal and supporting statement shall not in the aggregate exceed 500 words, and his reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; (ii) any material interest of the Stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below) in such business; (iii) the name, principal occupation and record address of the Stockholder; (iv) as to the Stockholder and any Stockholder Associated Person, the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are held of record or beneficially owned by the Stockholder and by such Stockholder Associated Person; (v) as to the Stockholder and any Stockholder Associated Person, the dates upon which the Stockholder and such Stockholder Associated Person acquired such shares of stock and documentary support for any claims of beneficial ownership; (vi) as to the Stockholder and any Stockholder Associated Person, whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such Stockholder or any such Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation; (vii) as to any Stockholder Associated Person covered by clauses (ii) through (vi) above, the name, principal occupation and record address of such Stockholder Associated Person; and (viii) such other matters as may be required by the Certificate of Incorporation. " _ _Stockholder Associated Person__ " of any Stockholder means (A) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such Stockholder, (B) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder and (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Stockholder Associated Person. 

  

 (d) The foregoing right of a Stockholder to propose business for consideration at an annual meeting of Stockholders shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and limitations as may be imposed by the Certificate of Incorporation. Nothing in this Section 2.13 shall entitle any Stockholder to propose business for consideration at any special meeting of Stockholders. 

  

 (e) The chairman of any meeting of Stockholders shall determine whether business has been properly brought before the meeting and, if the facts so warrant, may refuse to transact any business at such meeting which has not been properly brought before the meeting. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws, the Corporation shall be under no obligation to include any Stockholder proposal in its proxy statement or otherwise present any such proposal to Stockholders at a meeting of Stockholders if the Board of Directors reasonably believes that the proponents thereof have not complied with Sections 13 and 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _ _Exchange Act__ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Corporation shall not be required to include in its proxy statement to Stockholders any Stockholder proposal not required to be included in its proxy statement to Stockholders in accordance with the Exchange Act and such rules or regulations.

ARTICLE III 
  _Board of Directors  Powers, Number, Classification,_ 
  _Nominations, Resignations, Removal, Vacancies and Compensation_  

   

 Section 3.1. _Management_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by and under the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon the Board of Directors by these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may exercise all the powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the Stockholders. 

  

 Section 3.2. _Number and Qualification_. The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation. A director need not be a Stockholder or resident of the State of Delaware. Each director must have attained twenty-one (21) years of age. The maximum number of directors may not be increased by the Board of Directors to exceed ten (10) without the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members of Whole Board. 

  

 Section 3.3. _Classes of Directors; Election; Term of Office_. (a) The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III. Each director shall serve for a term expiring on the third annual meeting of Stockholders following the annual meeting of Stockholders at which such director was elected; provided, however, that the directors designated at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 3.3(c) below) pursuant to the Merger Agreement (as defined in Section 3.3(c) below) shall serve the following term: the directors designated to Class I shall serve for a term expiring on the Corporations first annual meeting of Stockholders after the Effective Time, the directors designated to Class II shall serve for a term expiring on the Corporations second annual meeting of Stockholders after the Effective Time and the directors designated to Class III shall serve for a term expiring on the 

   ##### 

  

 

Corporations third annual meeting of Stockholders after the Effective Time.
Each director shall hold office until the annual meeting of Stockholders at
which the directors term expires and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall
serve until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified,
or until his or her earlier death, designation or removal. The number of
directors in each class shall be the whole number contained in the quotient
arrived at by dividing the authorized number of directors by three, and if a
fraction is also contained in such quotient then if such fraction is one-
third (1/3), the extra director shall be a member of Class I, and if the
fraction is two-thirds (2/3), one of the extra directors shall be a member of
Class I and the other member of Class II. In the event of any increase or
decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then
serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of
which he is a member and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships
resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of
Directors among the three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one
class has more than one director more than any other class. To the extent
possible, consistent with the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships
shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the
latest dates following such allocation, and any newly eliminated
directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are
to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise
provided from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
No decrease in the number of directors constituting the number of directors
comprising the Whole Board shall have the effect of shortening the term
of any incumbent director. 

   

 (b) At each annual election, directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be of the same class as the directors they succeed unless, by reason of any intervening changes in the authorized number of directors, the Board of Directors shall designate one or more directorships whose term then expires as directorships of another class in order more nearly to achieve equality of number of directors among the classes. 

  

 (c) In accordance with the Merger Agreement (as defined below), effective as of the Effective Time (as defined below), the Board of Directors shall consist of nine directors: four Brown Directors (as defined below) and five Green Directors (as defined below). At the Effective Time: Class I shall consist of two Green Directors and one Brown Director; Class II shall consist of two Brown Directors and one Green Director; and Class III shall consist of two Green Directors and one Brown Director. In the event of the death, removal or resignation of a Brown Director prior to  _ _, 2009 (the date one year after the date of these Bylaws), the remaining Brown Directors shall be constituted as a committee to designate an individual to fill such vacancy. In the event of the death, removal or resignation of a Green Director prior to _ _, 2009 (the date one year after the date of these Bylaws), the remaining Green Directors shall be constituted as a committee to designate an individual to fill such vacancy. 

   

 (i) " _ _Brown Director__ " means each of those four individuals designated by Brown to serve as members of the Board of Directors as of the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement (which granted Brown a contractual right to designate such directors). 

   

 (ii) " _ _Effective Time__ " has the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) " _ _Merger Agreement__ " means the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 20, 2008, by and among Brown, Green and the Corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time, a copy of which shall be made available to any stockholder upon request. 

   

 (iv) " _ _Green Director__ " means each of those five individuals designated by Green to serve as members of the Board of Directors as of the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement (which granted Green a contractual right to designate such directors). 

  

 Section 3.4. _Nominations_.

Nominations by Stockholders shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a Stockholders notice given in the context of an annual meeting of Stockholders shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the Corporation not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days in advance of the first anniversary of the date of the Corporations proxy statement released to Stockholders in connection with the previous years annual meeting of Stockholders; _provided, however_ , that if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting of Stockholders has been changed by more than 30 calendar days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous years proxy statement, the notice must be received by the Corporation no earlier than 150 days prior to the date of the meeting and no later than the later of 120 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the meeting was first made. To be timely, a Stockholders notice given in the context of a special meeting of Stockholders shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such special meeting. For purposes of the foregoing, "public announcement" means the disclosure in a press release reported by the PR Newswire, Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Any meeting of Stockholders which is adjourned, for purposes of any notice contemplated by this paragraph (b), shall be deemed to be a continuation of the original meeting and no nominations by a Stockholder of persons to be elected directors of the Corporation may be made at any such reconvened meeting other than pursuant to a notice that was timely for the meeting on the date originally noticed. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Each notice given by a Stockholder as contemplated by paragraph (b) above shall set forth the following information, in addition to any other information or matters required by the Certificate of Incorporation:

 (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the Stockholder giving the notice (or any Stockholder Associated Person covered by clause (ii) above) and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by such Stockholder. 

 

At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of
Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the
Corporation that information required to be set forth in a Stockholders

The Corporation (i) shall, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the laws of the State of Delaware, indemnify every person who is or was a party or is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, and (ii) may, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the laws of the State of Delaware, indemnify every person who is or was a party or is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including counsel fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid or owed in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by such person or rendered or levied against such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent shall not, in itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that the person had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 

  

 Section 8.2. _Actions By or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation (i) shall, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the laws of the State of Delaware, indemnify every person who is or was a party or who is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, and (ii) may, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the laws of the State of Delaware, indemnify every person who is or was a party or who is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, _against_ expenses (including counsel fees) actually and reasonably incurred 

   ##### 

  

 

by such person in connection with the defense or settlement or such action or
suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation; _provided, however_ , that no indemnification shall be made with
respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of
the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification. 

   

 Section 8.3. _Determination_. Any indemnification under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or is such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the Stockholders. 

  

 Section 8.4. _Expenses_. Expenses incurred by a current or former director or officer of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents of the Corporation and other persons eligible for indemnification under this Article VIII may be paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. 

  

 Section 8.5. _Non-exclusivity_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other governing documents of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, under any agreement, vote of Stockholders or disinterested directors or under any policy or policies of insurance maintained by the Corporation on behalf of any person or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding any of the positions or having any of the relationships referred to in this Article VIII. 

  

 Section 8.6. _Enforceability_. The provisions of this Article VIII (i) are for the benefit of, and may be enforced directly by, each director or officer of the Corporation the same as if set forth in their entirety in a written instrument executed and delivered by the Corporation and such director or officer and (ii) constitute a continuing offer to all present and future directors and officers of the Corporation. The Corporation, by its adoption of these Bylaws, (A) acknowledges and agrees that each present and future director and officer of the Corporation has relied upon and will continue to rely upon the provisions of this Article VIII in becoming, and serving as, a director or officer of the Corporation or, if requested by the Corporation, a director, officer or 

   ##### 

  

 

fiduciary or the like of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, (B) waives reliance upon,
and all notices of acceptance of, such provisions by such directors and
officers and (C) acknowledges and agrees that no present or future director
or officer of the Corporation shall be prejudiced in his right to enforce
directly the provisions of this Article VIII in accordance with their terms
by any act or failure to act on the part of the Corporation. 

   

 Section 8.7. _Insurance_. The Board of Directors may authorize the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII. 

  

 Section 8.8. _Survival_. The provisions of this Article VIII shall continue as to any person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, executors, administrators, heirs, legatees and devisees of any person entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII. 

  

 Section 8.9. _Amendment_. No amendment, modification or repeal of this Article VIII or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future director or officer of the Corporation to be indemnified by the Corporation, nor the obligation of the Corporation to indemnify any such director or officer, under and in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising, in whole or in part, from a state of facts extant on the date of, or relating to matters occurring prior to, such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 

  

 Section 8.10. _Definitions_. For purposes of this Article VIII, (i) reference to any person shall include the estate, executors, administrators, heirs, legatees and devisees of such person, (ii) "employee benefit plan" and "fiduciary" shall be deemed to include, but not be limited to, the meaning set forth, respectively, in sections 3(3) and 21(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (iii) references to the judgments, fines and amounts paid or owed in settlement or rendered or levied shall be deemed to encompass and include excise taxes required to be paid pursuant to applicable law in respect of any transaction involving an employee benefit plan and (iv) references to the Corporation shall be deemed to include any predecessor corporation or entity and any constituent corporation or entity absorbed in a merger, consolidation or other reorganization of or by the Corporation which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries so that any person who was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of such predecessor or constituent corporation or entity, or served at the request of such predecessor or constituent corporation or entity as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the Corporation as such person would have with respect to such predecessor or constituent corporation or entity if its separate existence had continued.
