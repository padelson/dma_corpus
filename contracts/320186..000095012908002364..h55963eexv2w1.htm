to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
Applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not

any Claim for which indemnification could be sought by any Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such Claim and does not include any finding of fact admission or

Indemnified Party otherwise consents. In the event of any Claim, any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification shall promptly notify Holdings thereof (<I>provided </I>that failure to so notify
Holdings will not affect the obligations of Holdings except to the extent that Holdings shall have
been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure) and shall deliver to Holdings any
undertaking required by Applicable Law, but without any requirement for the posting of a bond.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Claim is brought against any of the Indemnified
Parties, Holdings shall be required to retain only one counsel (plus one local counsel, if
necessary) to represent all such Indemnified Parties with respect to each such matter unless the
use of one counsel to represent the Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict
of interest,

inappropriate due to actual or apparent differing interests between them, in which case such
additional counsel as may be required (as shall be reasonably determined by the Indemnified Parties
and Holdings) may be retained by the Indemnified Parties at the cost and expense of Holdings and
Holdings shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Parties.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of

statute or by this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the directors are
hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or
done by the Corporation

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class&nbsp;I, Class&nbsp;II
and Class&nbsp;III. Each director shall serve for a term expiring on the third annual meeting of
stockholders following the annual meeting stockholders at which such director was elected;
provided, however, that the directors designated at the Effective Time (as defined in this Article
SIXTH) pursuant to the Merger Agreement (as defined in this Article&nbsp;SIXTH) shall serve the
following term: the directors designated to Class&nbsp;I shall serve for a term expiring on the
Corporation&#146;s first annual meeting of stockholders after the Effective Time, the directors
designated to Class&nbsp;II shall serve for a term expiring on the Corporation&#146;s second annual meeting
of stockholders after the Effective Time and the directors designated to Class&nbsp;III shall serve for
a term expiring on the Corporation&#146;s third annual meeting of stockholders after the Effective Time.
Each director shall hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders at which the director&#146;s
term expires and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall serve until his or her successor shall have
been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, designation or removal. The
number of directors in each class shall be the whole number contained in the quotient arrived at by
dividing the authorized number of directors by three, and if a fraction is also contained in such
quotient then if such fraction is one-third (1/3), the extra director shall be a member of Class&nbsp;I,
and if the fraction is two-thirds (2/3), one of the extra directors shall be a member of Class&nbsp;I
and the other member of Class&nbsp;II. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized
number of directors, (i)&nbsp;each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a
director of the class of which he is a member and (ii)&nbsp;the newly created or eliminated
directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of
Directors among the three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than one
director more than any other class. To the extent possible, consistent with the foregoing rule,
any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire
at the latest dates following such allocation, and any newly eliminated directorships shall be
subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following
such allocation, unless otherwise provided from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of
Directors. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the number of directors comprising
the Whole Board shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;In accordance with the Merger Agreement (as defined below), effective as of the Effective
Time (as defined below), the Board of Directors shall consist of nine directors: four Brown
Directors (as defined below) and five Green Directors (as defined below). At the Effective Time:
Class&nbsp;I shall consist of two Green Directors and one Brown Director; Class&nbsp;II shall consist of two
Brown Directors and one Green Director; and Class&nbsp;III shall consist of two Green Directors and one
Brown Director. In the event of the death, removal or resignation of a Brown Director prior to
<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, 2009 (the date one year after the date of this Certificate of Incorporation), the

such vacancy. In the event of the death, removal or resignation of a Green Director prior to
<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, 2009 (the date one year after the date of this Certificate of Incorporation), the

annual meeting of Stockholders after the Effective Time. Each director shall hold office until the
annual meeting of Stockholders at which the director&#146;s term expires and, notwithstanding the
foregoing, shall serve until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or
until his or her earlier death, designation or removal. The number of directors in each class
shall be the whole number contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the authorized number of
directors by three, and if a fraction is also contained in such quotient then if such fraction is
one-third (1/3), the extra director shall be a member of Class&nbsp;I, and if the fraction is two-thirds

In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i)&nbsp;each director
then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he is a member

whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation, and any newly
eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire
at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided from time to time by
