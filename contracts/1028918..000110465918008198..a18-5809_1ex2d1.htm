exchange for, the right to receive 0.4750 of a share of PPBI Common Stock (the
"Exchange Ratio").

 



 

3.02 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Mailing of Transmittal Material_. Provided that Grandpoint has delivered,
or caused to be delivered, to the agent designated by PPBI (who, if different
than PPBIs or Grandpoints then serving registrar and transfer agent, is
reasonably acceptable to Grandpoint) (the "Exchange Agent") all information
which is reasonably necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Date (but in no event more than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Date), mail and otherwise make available to
each holder of record of Grandpoint Common Stock, a notice and a form of
letter of transmittal, in a form reasonably acceptable to Grandpoint (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
such Certificate(s) theretofore representing shares of Grandpoint Common Stock
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange
Agent or transfer of Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent), advising such
holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering
to the Exchange Agent such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
the Merger Consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to
Section 3.01(b) hereof. A letter of transmittal will be properly completed
only if accompanied by a Certificate or Certificates or instructions to
transfer Book-Entry Shares representing all shares of Grandpoint Common Stock
covered thereby, subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section
3.02.

 



 

(b) _PPBI Deliveries_. At the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders
of Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares, PPBI shall deliver to the Exchange
Agent, to be given to the holders of Grandpoint Common Stock in exchange for
their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as provided for in this Article III,
(i) certificates, or at PPBIs option, evidence of shares in book entry form,
representing the number of whole shares of PPBI Common Stock issuable to the
holders of Grandpoint Common Stock as the Merger Consideration and (ii) an
amount in cash equal to the amount due in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 3.04. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise
any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of PPBI Common Stock held
by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
shares of PPBI Common Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.

 



 

(c) _Issued Shares_. All shares of PPBI Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and
whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by PPBI in respect of
the PPBI Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective
Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in
respect of all shares of PPBI Common Stock issuable pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the PPBI Common
Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares until such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in Section 3.02(e)) or Book-Entry Shares are
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following the surrender of any such Certificate (or

or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of PPBI Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends
or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of PPBI Common Stock and
not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of PPBI Common Stock
with a record date at or after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender.

 



 

(d) _Exchange Agent Deliveries_.

 



 

(i) Each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who has surrendered such Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange
Agent, be entitled to evidence of issuance in book entry form, or upon written
request of such holder, a certificate or certificates representing, the number
of whole shares of PPBI Common Stock and the amount of cash, if any, into
which the aggregate number of shares of Grandpoint Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any other
distribution theretofore paid with respect to PPBI Common Stock issuable in
the Merger, in each case, without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose consistent with the
notice and form of letter of transmittal to effect an orderly exchange thereof
in accordance with normal exchange practices.

 



 

(ii) Each outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share which prior to the
Effective Time represented Grandpoint Common Stock and which is not
surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided
for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered
to the Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence ownership of the number of shares
of PPBI Common Stock and the amount of cash, if any, into which such
Grandpoint Common Stock shall have been converted. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no further transfer on the records of Grandpoint of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Grandpoint Common
Stock and, if such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
Grandpoint for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of
certificates for PPBI Common Stock and cash as hereinabove provided.

 



 

(e) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates; Issuances of PPBI Common Stock in New
Names_. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver a certificate or
certificates representing shares of PPBI Common Stock to which a holder of
Grandpoint Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger
until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the
shares of Grandpoint Common Stock for exchange as provided in

 



      
 

 



 

this Section 3.02, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss
and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be reasonably
required in each case by PPBI. If any certificates evidencing shares of PPBI
Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate evidencing Grandpoint Common Stock surrendered in exchange
therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an
executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of PPBI Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



 

(f) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_ **. **The exchange of shares of
Grandpoint Common Stock for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Section 3.02 shall be administered by the Exchange Agent until such time as
any unclaimed portion thereof is required to be delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Neither
the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any
holder of stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any
consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon the stock transfer books of Grandpoint to establish the identity of
those Persons entitled to receive the consideration specified in this
Agreement, which books shall be conclusive (absent manifest error) with
respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow with an
independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims
thereto.

 



 

3.03 _Rights as Shareholders_. At the Effective Time, holders of Grandpoint
Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of
Grandpoint other than to receive the consideration provided for under this
Article III.

 



 

3.04 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of PPBI Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Grandpoint Common Stock
who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of PPBI Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without
interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the PPBI Average Share
Price, rounded to the nearest whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
share.

 



 

3.05 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each outstanding share of Grandpoint Common Stock held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of adoption of the Agreement or consented thereto
in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Grandpoint Common
Stock being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such
time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under the

 



      
 

 



 

DGCL with respect to such shares of Grandpoint Common Stock) shall not be
converted into a right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, but
instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of
the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, such shares of Grandpoint Common Stock shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01(b), without interest thereon. Grandpoint shall give
PPBI prompt notice upon receipt by Grandpoint of any such written demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of Grandpoint Common Stock and of
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments provided pursuant to the
DGCL. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost the right to dissent (through failure to perfect or otherwise), the
Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be converted on a share by share
basis into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement. Any payments made in respect of
Dissenting Shares shall be made by PPBI or the Surviving Corporation within
the time period set forth in the DGCL.

 



 

3.06 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, the shares of PPBI Common Stock shall be changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-
up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, stock dividend or
distribution, stock split (including a reverse stock split), issuer tender or
exchange offer or other similar transaction in PPBI Common Stock, the Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly; provided that a bona fide offering or
sale of PPBI Common Stock for fair value received shall not be deemed a
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or readjustment, stock dividend or distribution, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar
transaction in PPBI Common Stock.

 



 

3.07 _Withholding Rights_. PPBI (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Grandpoint Common Stock
such amounts as PPBI reasonably determines is required under the Code or any
state, local or foreign Tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment, and to collect any
necessary Tax forms or other necessary information. Except for any withholding
required as the result of any failure to deliver any certificates or forms
requested for purposes of federal backup withholding, in the event PPBI
reasonably determines that it is so required to deduct or withhold an amount
for or on account of any Tax from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, PPBI shall use reasonable efforts to
notify Grandpoint of its determination and the parties shall cooperate in good
faith to minimize to the extent permissible the amount of any such deduction
or withholding, including providing any certificates or forms that are
reasonably requested to establish and exemption from (or reduction in) any
deduction or withholding. Any amounts so withheld shall be timely remitted to
the applicable Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Grandpoint Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by PPBI.

 



      
 

 



 

3.08 _Grandpoint Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to acquire
shares of Grandpoint Common Stock (collectively, the "Grandpoint Options")
which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive from Grandpoint
immediately prior to the Effective Time a single lump sum cash payment, equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Grandpoint Common Stock subject
to such Grandpoint Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
the excess, if any, of (A) the PPBI Average Share Price multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio over (B) the exercise price per share of such Grandpoint Option
(the "Option Merger Consideration"), less any applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise price per share of any
such Grandpoint Option is equal to or greater than the PPBI Average Share
Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, such Grandpoint Option shall be
canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Grandpoint
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written acknowledgement of
each holder of a then outstanding Grandpoint Option with regard to the
cancellation of such Grandpoint Option and the payment therefor in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Grandpoint
Equity Plans and all Grandpoint Options issued thereunder shall terminate at
the Effective Time.

 



 

3.09 _Reservation of Shares_. Prior to the Closing, the PPBI Board shall
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of PPBI Common Stock for
the purpose of issuing its shares in exchange for shares of Grandpoint Common
Stock in the Merger.

delivered to Grandpoint a schedule and Grandpoint has delivered to PPBI a
schedule (each respectively, its "Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among
other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either
in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision
hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained
in Articles IV or VI; provided, however, that the mere inclusion of an item in
a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall
not be deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that, absent such inclusion in the
Disclosure Schedule, such item is or would be reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

5.02 _Standard_. Solely for the purposes of determining whether the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as the case may be, have been
satisfied (and without otherwise qualifying any representation or warranty
made on the date hereof), no representation or warranty of Grandpoint on the
one hand or PPBI on the other hand contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04,
respectively, other than the representations of Grandpoint contained in
Section 5.03(b), which shall be true in all respects, except to a de minimis
extent (relative to Section 5.03(b) taken as a whole), and the representations
of Grandpoint contained in Section 5.03(m)(v), which shall be true in all
material respects, shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes of
Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), and no party hereto shall be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty for purposes of such Sections, as a
consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or
warranty contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04, has had or is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the party making such representation or
warranty.

good standing in each jurisdiction where its ownership or leasing of property
or assets or the conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or
qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
have nor reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Grandpoint has in effect
all federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorizations necessary
for it to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as now conducted. The copies of the Grandpoint Articles and Grandpoint Bylaws
which have previously been made available to PPBI are true, complete and
correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

to Grandpoints Knowledge, no event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) will,
or would reasonably be expected to, (A) give any Person the right to declare a
default with respect to, or exercise any remedy under any material provision
of, any Material Contract, (B) give any Person the right to accelerate the

Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of all documents,
contracts or agreements pursuant to which such Benefit Plan is maintained.
Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter, or advisory or opinion letter, as applicable, from the
IRS, and no circumstances exist that are reasonably likely to result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of the
qualification of such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is
no pending or, to Grandpoints Knowledge, threatened proceeding, lawsuit or

 



      
 

 



 

claim (other than a routine claim for benefits) relating to the Benefit Plans.
Neither Grandpoint nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to or could
reasonably be likely to be subject to a material liability, fine or penalty of
any kind with respect to any Benefit Plan under either the Code or ERISA. No

that may be imposed under ERISA or the Code with respect to the operation,
administration or funding of any Benefit Plan. Since January 1, 2016, no
Benefit Plan or related trust has been the subject of an audit, investigation
or examination or other proceeding by the IRS, the DOL or other Governmental
Authority. There have been no nonexempt "prohibited transactions" within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA and no breach of
fiduciary duty has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan in connection
with which Grandpoint or any Subsidiary reasonably could be subject to either
a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax
imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code. With respect to each
Benefit Plan, as applicable, all reports and disclosures required to be filed
or delivered under ERISA and the Code have been accurate in all material
respects as of the date filed, have been filed or distributed in a timely
manner, and any Taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid.

any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, a multiple employer plan (as
defined in Section 413(c) of the Code) or multiemployer plan (as defined in
4001(a)(3) of ERISA), a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA" or a Retiree
Welfare Plan, other than those disclosed and identified as such in Section
5.03(m)(iii) of Grandpoints Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in
Section 5.03(m)(iii) of Grandpoints Disclosure Schedule, no Benefit Plan
holds as an asset an annuity contract, guaranteed investment contract or other
investment contract issued by an insurance company.

 



 

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan
(including any amounts withheld from employees paychecks with respect to a
Benefit Plan) and premiums required to be paid have been timely made or paid
when due in accordance with the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan and
applicable law. All contributions for any period ending on or before the
Closing Date that are not yet due have been made or have been reflected
appropriately in the Grandpoint Financial Statements. Benefits under each
Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA), with the exception of any flexible spending
arrangements subject to Sections 125 and 105 of the Code and health savings
accounts, are provided exclusively through insurance contracts or policies
issued by an insurance company, health maintenance organization, or similar
organization unrelated to Grandpoint or any of its Subsidiaries, the premiums
for which are paid directly by Grandpoint or any of its Subsidiaries, from its
general assets or partly from its general assets and partly from contributions
by its employees. No insurance policy or contract relating to a Benefit Plan
requires or permits a retroactive increase to premiums or payments due
thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) Except as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(v) of Grandpoints Disclosure
Schedule, none of the execution of this Agreement, Grandpoint shareholder
adoption of the Agreement or consummation of the Transaction, either alone or

or former director or independent contractor of Grandpoint or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment or service after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the

grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable under, or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to,
any of the Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any of the Benefit Plans or (D) result in the payment of any

obligation to maintain, establish, sponsor, participate in or contribute to
any Benefit Plan or other similar arrangement that is subject to any law or
applicable custom or rule of any jurisdiction outside of the United States.

 



 

(vii) Each Benefit Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) (hereinafter referred to as a

material compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Neither Grandpoint nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any liability or is a party with respect to any gross-up
provision or agreement in connection with any income inclusion, interest or
additional Tax payable in accordance with Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

 



 

(viii) Except as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(viii) of Grandpoints Disclosure
Schedule and Section 6.11(b), each Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated
without the consent of the participants and without the imposition of any

any amendment or any binding commitment, or given written or oral notice
providing that it will increase benefits under any Benefit Plan, (B) created

(C) above, any such breach, violation, default, creation, acceleration,
termination or failure to obtain such consent or approval would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on PPBI and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(g) _Financial Reports and Securities Documents; Material Adverse Effect_.

 



 

(i) PPBIs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and

in all material respects as to form with the applicable requirements under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the case may be and (B) did not and will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except that information as of a later date shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date; and each of the consolidated statements of
financial condition contained in or incorporated by reference into any such
Securities Documents (including the related notes and schedules thereto)
fairly presents, or will fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of PPBI and its Subsidiaries as of its date,
and each of the consolidated statements of operations and stockholders equity
and other comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows or equivalent statements
in such Securities Documents (including any related notes and schedules
thereto) fairly presents, or will fairly present, in all material respects,
the consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and

flows, as the case may be, of PPBI and its Subsidiaries for the periods to
which they relate, in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except in each case as may be noted therein.

 



 

(ii) Except as set forth on the consolidated statements of financial condition
of PPBI dated as of September 30, 2017, neither PPBI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material liability (whether absolute, contingent or
accrued or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that would be required
to be reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance
with GAAP, other than liabilities (A) incurred after September 30, 2017 in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (B) incurred after
September 30, 2017 in connection with any acquisition by PPBI that was pending
as of September 30, 2017 or (C) incurred pursuant to or provided for in this
Agreement and that, individually or in the aggregate, are not and would not
reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transaction or (y) otherwise be material to PPBI and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

 



 

(iii) Since September 30, 2017, (A) PPBI and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course consistent with
past practice, (B) neither PPBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken nor
permitted or entered into any contract with respect to, or otherwise agreed or
committed to do or take, any action that, if taken after the date hereof,
would constitute a breach of any of the covenants in Section 4.02 and (C) no
event has occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or taken together
with all other facts, circumstances and events (described in any paragraph of
this Section 5.04 or otherwise), has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on PPBI and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(iv) PPBI is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq.

 



 

(v) PPBI maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by PPBI is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of PPBIs filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents. PPBI maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (A) pertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of PPBI, (B) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of PPBI are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of PPBI and (C) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of PPBIs assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) _Legal Proceedings_. No litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding
before any court or Governmental Authority is pending against PPBI or any of
its Subsidiaries and, to PPBIs Knowledge, no litigation, arbitration, claim
or other proceeding has been threatened and there are no facts which could
reasonably give rise to such litigation, arbitration, claim or other
proceeding in any such case that, individually or in the aggregate, has or
would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on PPBI and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither PPBI nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective properties is a party to or subject to any order,
judgment, decree or regulatory restrictions that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on PPBI and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(i) _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by PPBI or its Subsidiaries that
would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage
commission, finders fee or other like payment with respect to the
Transaction, other than a fee payable by PPBI to Raymond James and Associates,
Inc.

 



 

(j) _Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(i) Since January 1, 2015, PPBI and each of its Subsidiaries has duly filed
with the appropriate bank regulatory authorities in substantially correct form
the monthly, quarterly and annual reports required to be filed under
applicable law, regulation or policies imposed by any Governmental Authority,
and such reports were in all material respects complete and accurate and in
compliance with the requirements of applicable law, regulation or policies
imposed by any Governmental Authority. In connection with the most recent
examination of PPBI and each of its Subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory
authorities, neither PPBI nor any of its Subsidiaries was required to correct
or change any action, procedure or proceeding which PPBI believes in good
faith has not now been corrected or changed, other than corrections or changes
which, if not made, either individually or in the aggregate, would not have or
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on PPBI and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The most recent regulatory rating given to
Pacific Premier as to compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act is
"satisfactory." To the Knowledge of PPBI, since Pacific Premiers last
regulatory examination of Community Reinvestment Act compliance, Pacific
Premier has not received any complaints as to Community Reinvestment Act
compliance.

 



 

(ii) Neither PPBI nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of any of their
respective properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree,
directive, agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with,
or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory
letter from, nor has PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries adopted any policies,
procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any
Governmental Authority, that, in each case, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on PPBI
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. PPBI and its Subsidiaries have paid
all assessments made or imposed by any Governmental Authority.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Neither PPBI nor any its Subsidiaries has been advised by, and does not
have any Knowledge of facts which would reasonably be expected to give rise to
an advisory notice by, any Governmental Authority that such Governmental
Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the
appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, directive,
agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter
or similar submission or any request for the adoption of any policy, procedure
or board resolution.

 



 

(iv) (A) No Governmental Authority has initiated since January 1, 2015 or has
pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to PPBIs Knowledge,
investigation or inquiry into the business, operations, policies, practices or
disclosures of PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries (other than normal examinations
conducted by a Governmental Authority in the ordinary course of the business
of PPBI or the applicable Subsidiary), or, to PPBIs Knowledge, threatened any
of the foregoing, and (B) there is no unresolved violation, criticism, comment
or exception by any Governmental Authority with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of PPBI or its
Subsidiaries, other than, in each case, which would not reasonably be expected
to prevent, materially impair or materially delay the ability of PPBI and its
Subsidiaries, to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(v) PPBI and Pacific Premier are "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined
at 12 CFR §225.2(r) or the relevant regulation of its primary federal bank
regulator) and the rating of Pacific Premier under the Community Reinvestment
Act is no less than "satisfactory." Neither PPBI nor Pacific Premier has
received any notification from a Governmental Authority that their status as
"well-capitalized" or "satisfactory" for Community Reinvestment Act purposes
will change within one year, nor does PPBI have Knowledge of any conditions or
circumstances that would result in a Community Reinvestment Act rating of less
than "satisfactory" or material criticism from regulators with respect to
discriminatory lending practices. To the Knowledge of PPBI, since the last
regulatory examination of Pacific Premier with respect to Community
Reinvestment Act compliance, Pacific Premier has not received any material
complaints as to Community Reinvestment Act compliance.

 



 

(k) _Compliance With Laws_. Each of PPBI and its Subsidiaries:

 



 

(i) is, and at all times since January 1, 2015 has been in material compliance
with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, codes,
regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, injunctions, orders, decrees or
policies and/or guidelines of a Governmental Authority applicable thereto or
to the employees conducting such businesses, including, without limitation,
Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and FRB regulations pursuant
thereto, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community
Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the
USA PATRIOT Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E of the FRB,
all other applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to
discriminatory business practices and Environmental Laws and all posted and
internal policies of PPBI and its Subsidiaries related to customer data,
privacy and security;

connection therewith) that are required in order to permit them to own or
lease their properties and to conduct their businesses as presently conducted
in all material respects; all such permits, licenses, certificates of
authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to PPBIs
Knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened; and

 



 

(iii) has received no written notification or communication from any
Governmental Authority (A) asserting that PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries is
not in compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which
such Governmental Authority enforces or (B) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit or governmental authorization (nor, to PPBIs Knowledge, do
any grounds for any of the foregoing exist).

 



 

(l) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(i) All material benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
arrangements maintained, contributed to, obligated to be contributed to, or
sponsored by PPBI and Pacific Premier for the benefit of current or former
employees of PPBI and its Subsidiaries and current or former directors or
independent contractors of PPBI and its Subsidiaries including, but not
limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA, any pension, retirement, profit sharing, medical, life, accidental

cash-based incentive, or other similar plans, agreements, programs, policies
or other arrangements (whether written or oral and whether or not qualified or
funded) or any such plan for which PPBI and its Subsidiaries may have any
liability including, without limitation, as a result of being deemed a single
employer with any entity under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of
the Code (collectively, the "PPBI Benefit Plans"), have been provided or made
available to Grandpoint.

 



 

(ii) Each PPBI Benefit Plan has been established and administered to date in
all material respects in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of all
documents, contracts or agreements pursuant to which such PPBI Benefit Plan is
maintained.

 



 

(iii) Neither PPBI nor any entity considered to be a single employer with PPBI
under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code maintains or
contributes to any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, to any
multiemployer plan (as defined in 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), or to any PPBI Benefit
Plan providing for retiree health and life benefits, other than coverage as
may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA
or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the laws of any state or
locality.

 



      
 

 



 

(m) _Tax Matters_. (i) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed on or
before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions of time within
which to file that have not expired) by or with respect to PPBI or any of its
Subsidiaries have been or will be timely filed on or before the Closing Date,
(ii) all such Tax Returns are or will be true, correct and complete in all
material respects, (iii) all Taxes due and payable by or with respect to PPBI
or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown as due on any Tax Return)
have been timely paid in full, (iv) the unpaid Taxes of PPBI and its
Subsidiaries did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements,
exceed the reserve for Tax liability set forth on the face of such financial
statements and do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of
PPBI and its Subsidiaries in filing its Tax Returns, (v) all deficiencies
asserted or assessments made as a result of examinations conducted by any
taxing authority have been paid in full, other than those being contested
through appropriate proceedings and (vi) no claim has been made in writing in

any of its Subsidiaries does not already file Tax Returns that PPBI or a
Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 



 

(n) _Ownership of Grandpoint Common Stock_. None of PPBI or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to PPBIs Knowledge, any of its other affiliates or
associates (as such terms are defined under the Exchange Act), owns
beneficially or of record, directly or indirectly, or is a party to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
voting or disposing of, shares of Grandpoint Common Stock (other than shares
held in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties or
as a result of debts previously contracted).

 



 

(o) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since January 1, 2015, there has
not been any Material Adverse Effect with respect to PPBI or any event or
development that is reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to PPBI.

 



 

(p) _No Additional Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties made by PPBI in this Section 5.04, as Previously Disclosed, or in
any certificate delivered by PPBI to Grandpoint, neither PPBI nor any other
Person makes or has made any express or implied representation or warranty, at
law or in equity, with respect to PPBI, its Subsidiaries, or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, and PPBI hereby expressly disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. Except for the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 5.03, as Previously Disclosed, or in any certificate
delivered by Grandpoint to PPBI, PPBI specifically disclaims that it is
relying upon or has relied upon any representations or warranties, and

all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws,

(a) PPBI agrees to prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 (the
"Registration Statement") to be filed by PPBI with the SEC in connection with
the issuance of the shares of PPBI Common Stock to the Grandpoint shareholders
as the Merger Consideration in the Merger (including a proxy statement and
other proxy solicitation instruments of PPBI constituting a part thereof for

to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and

Agreement. PPBI and Grandpoint shall, within three (3) Business Days from the
date when the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act, mail at its respective expense the PPBI Proxy Statement and
the Grandpoint Consent Statement, respectively, to all of their respective
shareholders. The Grandpoint Consent Statement shall include a form of written

(b) Each of Grandpoint and PPBI agrees that none of the information supplied
or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, (ii) the PPBI Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the date of mailing to PPBIs

Grandpoint Shareholder Consents are solicited, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Grandpoint
and PPBI further agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to the
date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the PPBI Meeting or
delivery of the Grandpoint Shareholder Consents, of any information furnished
by such party that would cause any of the statements in the Registration
Statement, the PPBI Proxy Statement or the Grandpoint Consent Statement to be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other parties thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Registration Statement, the PPBI Proxy
Statement or the Grandpoint Consent Statement.

is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any
request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration
Statement or for additional information.

party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other party hereto with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to

communication with a Governmental Authority.

 



 

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and

before issuing any press release with respect to the Transaction or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that PPBI or
Grandpoint may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such
consultation, to the extent practicable under the circumstances), issue such
press release or make such public statements as may, upon the advice of
outside counsel, be required by law or the rules or regulations of the SEC or
the Nasdaq. Grandpoint and PPBI shall cooperate to develop all public
announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the Transaction as reasonably requested by the other
party. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.05 shall be deemed to
restrict or prohibit any communications made by Grandpoint to its shareholders
and its shareholders limited partners or other investors.

 



      
 

 



 

6.06 _Access; Information_.

 



 

(a) Grandpoint agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
law, regulation or policies imposed by any Governmental Authority relating to

Effective Time to the books, records (including, without limitation, Tax
Returns and work papers of independent auditors), systems, properties,

or state banking, lending, securities, consumer finance or privacy laws and
(ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel
of Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries as PPBI may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grandpoint shall not be required to provide
access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Grandpoint or any other Person in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement, provided that in any such event, Grandpoint will work in good faith
with PPBI to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

 



 

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
Grandpoint shall, upon the request of PPBI, cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of PPBI regarding its consolidated financial condition,

and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 by no later than March 9,
2018. Subject to applicable law, within 15 days after the end of each month,
Grandpoint will deliver to PPBI a consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statements of income, without related notes, for such month prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) PPBI agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable law,
regulation or policies imposed by any Governmental Authority relating to the
exchange of information, it shall afford Grandpoint and Grandpoints officers,
employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives such
access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time to the books, records (including, without limitation, Tax
Returns and work papers of independent auditors), systems, properties,
personnel and advisors of PPBI and its Subsidiaries and to such other
information relating to PPBI and its Subsidiaries as Grandpoint may reasonably
request, provided that Grandpoint shall coordinate any and all meetings with
PPBI personnel with one or more designated representatives of PPBI, and,
during such period, PPBI shall furnish promptly to Grandpoint (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
banking, lending, securities, consumer finance or privacy laws and (ii) all
other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of PPBI
and its Subsidiaries as Grandpoint may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, PPBI shall not be required to provide access to or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of PPBI or any other Person in possession or control of such
information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, provided that
in any such event, PPBI will work in good faith with Grandpoint to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

 



 

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
PPBI shall, upon the request of Grandpoint, cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of Grandpoint regarding its consolidated financial condition,
operations and business and matters relating to the completion of the
Transaction. Subject to applicable law, as soon as reasonably available, but
in no event more than 15 days after the end of each calendar quarter ending
after the date of this Agreement (other than the last quarter of each fiscal
year ending December 31), PPBI will deliver to Grandpoint its consolidated
balance sheet and consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
equity and cash flows, without related notes, for such quarter prepared in
accordance with GAAP, and, as soon as reasonably available, but in no event
more than 30 days after the end of each fiscal year, PPBI will deliver to
Grandpoint its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for such year prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Subject to applicable law, within 15 days after the end
of each month, PPBI will deliver to Grandpoint a consolidated balance sheet
and consolidated statements of income, without related notes, for such month
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(e) All information furnished pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall be subject
to the provisions of the letter agreement, dated as of December 1, 2017, by
and between PPBI and Grandpoint (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 



 

(f) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
other parties set forth herein.

 



      
 

 



 

6.07 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Grandpoint agrees that it shall, and shall direct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
it) (all of the foregoing, collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties that may be
ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal, and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal,
including by requesting the other party to promptly return or destroy any
confidential information previously furnished by or on behalf of Grandpoint or
any of its Subsidiaries thereunder and by specifically enforcing the terms
thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. From the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, neither Grandpoint nor its Subsidiaries shall, and
each of the foregoing shall cause their respective directors, officers or
employees or any Representative retained by them not to, directly or
indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take
any other action designed to facilitate or that is likely to result in, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide any
confidential information or data to any Person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any
provision of any contractual "standstill" or similar obligations of any Person
other than PPBI or its Affiliates, (v) approve or recommend, propose to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase agreement or share
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Acquisition Proposal or propose to do any of the foregoing, or (vi) make or
authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that at any time prior to obtaining
the Shareholder Approval, if the Grandpoint Board determines in good faith,
after consulting with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the
failure to do so would breach, or would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of, the Grandpoint Boards fiduciary duties under applicable law,
Grandpoint may, in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal not
solicited in violation of this Section 6.07(a) that the Grandpoint Board
determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (1) furnish
information with respect to itself to any Person making such a Superior
Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement on terms that are in all
material respects no less restrictive to such Person than the terms contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement are to PPBI (as determined by Grandpoint
after consultation with its outside counsel) (the "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement"), and (2) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
a Superior Proposal. Grandpoint agrees that it shall concurrently provide to
PPBI any information (whether such information is confidential, nonpublic or
otherwise) concerning Grandpoint or Grandpoint Bank that may be provided to
any other Person in connection with any Superior Proposal which has not
previously been provided to PPBI. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any
regulatory application or notice or disclosure of an intention to do any of
the foregoing from any Person relating to any (w) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 10% or more of the
total revenues, net income, assets or deposits of Grandpoint and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
of any class of Equity

 



      
 

 



 

Securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of Grandpoint or
Grandpoint Bank, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of Equity
Securities of Grandpoint or Grandpoint Bank or (z) merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Grandpoint or Grandpoint Bank, other than the
Transaction contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal made by a
third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the
combined voting power of the shares of Grandpoint Common Stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all of Grandpoints consolidated assets,
which the Grandpoint Board determines in good faith, after taking into account
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the
person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation), and after consulting with
Grandpoints financial advisor (which shall be a recognized investment banking
firm) and outside counsel, (i) is more favorable from a financial point of
view to its shareholders than the Merger, (ii) is reasonably likely to be
consummated on the terms set forth, and (iii) for which financing, to the
extent required, is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the
Grandpoint Board, is reasonably likely to be obtained by such third party.

 



 

(b) Neither the Grandpoint Board nor any committee thereof shall (or shall
agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to PPBI, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to PPBI, the
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Grandpoint Board or any
such committee of this Agreement or the Merger in connection with the
solicitation of Grandpoint Shareholder Consents or otherwise (any such action,
resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an
"Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) recommend, declare advisable or propose
to recommend or declare advisable the approval or adoption of any Acquisition
Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action, or adopt or approve any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) cause or permit Grandpoint to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "Acquisition
Agreement") constituting or related to, or which would reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement), or resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the Shareholder Approval, the Grandpoint Board
may (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) in response to a
Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) to
accept such Superior Proposal, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), if
the Grandpoint Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Grandpoint under applicable law,
provided that the Grandpoint Board may not effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
unless the Grandpoint Board shall have first provided written notice to PPBI
(an "Adverse Change Notice") at least three Business Days prior to such action
that it is prepared to take such action and, if such action is in response to
a Superior Proposal, the following additional conditions are satisfied: (A)
such notice shall attach the most

 



      
 

 



 

current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal and (B) PPBI does not make, within three
Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Grandpoint Board (after consultation
with a financial advisor of national reputation and outside legal counsel),
cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment or modification of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Adverse Change Notice and a new three Business Day period). Grandpoint agrees
that, during the three Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination pursuant to Section 8.01(f), Grandpoint
and its officers, directors and Representatives shall negotiate in good faith
with PPBI and its officers, directors and Representatives regarding any
revisions to the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement proposed by PPBI. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Grandpoint shall not be entitled to enter into any
agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to
a Superior Proposal unless this Agreement has been terminated by its terms
pursuant to Section 8.01, and Grandpoint has paid to PPBI the Termination Fee
or pays to PPBI the Termination Fee substantially concurrently with the
termination of the Agreement.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Grandpoint set forth in this Section
6.07, Grandpoint shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise PPBI orally and in
writing of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) Grandpoint agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.07 by any Representative of Grandpoint or its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed a breach of this Section 6.07 by Grandpoint.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Grandpoint or the
Grandpoint Board from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

6.08 _Certain Policies_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and provided
that each party has confirmed in writing that all conditions to its
obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is
prepared to effect the Merger, upon the request of PPBI, Grandpoint shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking
laws, regulations or policies imposed by any Governmental Authority, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to modify or change their Loan, OREO, accrual,
reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices
(including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on
a basis that is consistent with that of PPBI; provided, however, no such
modification or change made by Grandpoint or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Section 6.08 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation
of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in
determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall
have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to
imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or
information and shall not be construed as concurrence of Grandpoint or its
management with any such adjustments.

 



       
 

 



 

6.09 _Nasdaq Listing_. PPBI shall, as promptly as practicable, file all
documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of PPBI Common Stock to be issued
to the Grandpoint shareholders as the Merger Consideration in the Merger to be
approved for quotation on the Nasdaq prior to the Effective Date.

 



 

6.10 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, PPBI and the Surviving Corporation (each an "Indemnifying
Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director,
officer and employee of Grandpoint or a Grandpoint Subsidiary, as applicable,
determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any
and all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to
the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent
of Grandpoint or any Grandpoint Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request
of Grandpoint or any Grandpoint Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, including, without limitation, matters related to the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of
the Transaction, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be
entitled under the Grandpoint Articles and the Grandpoint Bylaws or any
agreement, arrangement or understanding which has been set forth in Section
6.10 of Grandpoints Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the
date hereof. PPBI shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to advance
expenses as incurred by such Indemnified Parties to the same extent as such
persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this
Agreement by Grandpoint pursuant to the Grandpoint Articles and the Grandpoint
Bylaws or any agreement, arrangement or understanding which has been set forth
in Section 6.10 of Grandpoints Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect
on the date hereof.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Parties that make joint representation inappropriate, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed

 



      
 

 



 

one firm in any jurisdiction unless the Indemnified Parties have conflicts of
interest), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will reasonably cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (iv) the Indemnifying
Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state
banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine by final,
non-appealable written order that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law, regulation or
policies imposed by any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Grandpoint shall, and if Grandpoint is unable
to, PPBI (and the Surviving Corporation) shall as of the Effective Time obtain
and fully pay for a "tail" liability insurance policy (or provide a policy
providing comparable coverage and amounts on terms no less favorable to the
persons currently covered by Grandpoints existing policy, including PPBIs
existing policy if it meets the foregoing standard) covering persons who are
currently covered by such insurance for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as Grandpoints current insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with benefits
and levels of coverage at least as favorable as Grandpoints existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction);
provided, however, that in no event shall Grandpoint be permitted nor shall
PPBI be obligated to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance
coverage pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums paid by Grandpoint as of the date hereof for such insurance
("Maximum Insurance Amount"); provided further, that if the amount of the
annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum Insurance Amount, PPBI shall obtain the most advantageous
coverage obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Insurance
Amount. PPBI shall provide proof of such coverage to Grandpoint no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) The obligations of PPBI and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.10 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner adverse
to any Indemnified Party or any other Person entitled to the benefits of this
Section 6.10, or to whom this Section 6.10 applies, without the written
consent of the affected Indemnified Party or Parties and/or such other Person,
as the case may be. If PPBI or any of its successors or assigns shall
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall
transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and
in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of PPBI shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and his or her Representatives, as set forth in Section 9.07 herein, and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

6.11 _Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, PPBI
shall transition Transferred Employees of Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries from
the Benefit Plans of Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries to the corresponding PPBI
Benefit Plans and take all reasonable action so that Transferred Employees of
Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each PPBI
Benefit Plan of general applicability to the same extent as similarly-situated
employees of PPBI and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of
the Transferred Employees of Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries in the PPBI
Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans),
provided that coverage shall be continued under the corresponding Benefit
Plans of Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries until such Transferred Employees are
permitted to participate in the PPBI Benefit Plans and provided further,
however, that nothing contained herein shall require PPBI or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of Grandpoint and its
Subsidiaries under any discretionary equity compensation plan of PPBI. PPBI
shall cause each PPBI Benefit Plan in which employees of Grandpoint and its
Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits and for all
other purposes (but not for accrual of pension benefits) under the PPBI
Benefit Plans, the service of such Transferred Employees with Grandpoint and
its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such
purpose by Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent not otherwise permissible
under the terms of a PPBI Benefit Plan. Nothing herein shall limit the ability
of PPBI to amend or terminate any of the PPBI Benefit Plans or the Grandpoint
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.

 



 

(b) At and following the Effective Time, PPBI shall honor, and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with
their terms, all change-in-control agreements and supplemental employee
retirement plans of Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries to the extent that each of
the foregoing (including amounts accrued or otherwise payable pursuant
thereto) are expressly set forth in Section 6.11(b) of Grandpoints Disclosure
Schedule.

 



 

(c) In the event PPBI transitions Transferred Employees of Grandpoint and its
Subsidiaries from the group medical, dental, health, life or long-term
disability plan of Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries to the corresponding PPBI
Benefit Plan at any time prior to the end of the applicable plan year of the
group medical, dental, health, life or long-term disability plan of Grandpoint
and its Subsidiaries, at such time as Transferred Employees become eligible to
participate in such corresponding PPBI Benefit Plan, PPBI shall cause each
such PPBI Benefit Plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to
the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable PPBI Benefit Plan,
(ii) provide full credit under medical, health and dental plans for any
deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Transferred
Employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year
prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to
such employee on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under a corresponding
Grandpoint Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that
such waiver shall not be required to the extent that such waiver would result
in a duplication of benefits or to the extent not otherwise permissible under
the terms of a contract insuring benefits under the PPBI Benefit Plans.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Within sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, PPBI shall
identify the Employees for whom PPBI agrees to continue employment following
the Closing provided they are employed by, and in good standing with,
Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (the
"Transferred Employees"). Effective as of, and subject to, the Closing,
Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries shall terminate the employment of those
Employees who are not Transferred Employees and shall pay any severance,
retention, change in control, accrued and unused paid time off, the Option
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.08 hereof, or other similar
payments, in each case, which have been Previously Disclosed by Grandpoint to
PPBI, obtain an executed general release of claims that has not been revoked,
and pay to the proper taxing authorities any income and employment Tax
withholding as well as the employer portions of any applicable employment
Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Option Merger Consideration will be
paid by Grandpoint to all Employees (including Employees who are not
Transferred Employees) with respect to all outstanding Grandpoint Options,
whether vested or unvested, in accordance with Section 3.08 of this Agreement.
PPBI shall remain responsible for payment to any Transferred Employee of any
severance or similar compensation and benefits payable following a termination
of employment. Those employees of Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries who do not
continue their employment with PPBI or its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time, who are not a party to an employment agreement or otherwise
entitled to an existing severance package and who sign and deliver a release
agreement (to be agreed by PPBI and Grandpoint) within 60 days of the
Effective Time, shall be entitled to receive a single lump sum payment of
severance equal to two weeks of base salary plus an additional two weeks of
salary for each completed year of service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks. For
purposes of the foregoing, any severance benefits payable in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence pursuant to timely delivered termination
and release agreements shall be paid on the later to occur of (i) the PPBI
payroll date for the PPBI payroll period during which the former employee
delivers to the Surviving Corporation his or her executed termination and
release agreement, or (ii) the PPBI payroll date for the PPBI payroll period
during which the former employees termination and release agreement becomes
effective following the expiration of any revocation period afforded under
applicable law. If Grandpoint or any of its Subsidiaries has any other
severance pay plan or arrangement, then any amounts paid pursuant to that plan
or arrangement shall reduce the amount that the employee will receive under
this Section 6.11(f) and in no event shall there be any duplication of
severance pay. Nothing contained in this Section 6.11(f) hereof shall be
construed or interpreted to limit or modify in any way PPBIs or its
Subsidiaries at will employment policy or provide any third party beneficiary
rights to employees of Grandpoint or any of its Subsidiaries. In no event
shall severance pay be taken into account in determining the amount of any
other benefit (including but not limited to, an individuals benefit under any
retirement plan or policy).

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing, Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries shall have paid into
the Grandpoint Retirement Plan (the "Grandpoint Retirement Plan") all employer
contributions, including any employer matching contributions, profit sharing
contributions or other non-elective contributions. Prior to the Closing,
Grandpoint shall (i) adopt written resolutions (or

 



      
 

 



 

take such other necessary or appropriate action), in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to PPBI, to terminate the Grandpoint Retirement Plan in
compliance with its terms and requirements of applicable law, effective no
later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date and (ii) provide for
full vesting of all non-elective contributions under the Grandpoint Retirement
Plan for all participants who currently maintain an account under the
Grandpoint Retirement Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective no
later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date. Grandpoint shall
provide PPBI with evidence of the termination of the Grandpoint Retirement
Plan.

 



 

(f) Each of Grandpoint and PPBI acknowledges and agrees that all provisions
contained within this Section 6.11 with respect to Employees are included for
the sole benefit of Grandpoint and nothing contained in this Section 6.11
shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.11. Nothing contained herein
(i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program
or arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the ability of PPBI to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program or arrangement at any time established,
sponsored or maintained by PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Grandpoint
and PPBI agrees that the terms of this Section 6.11 do not and shall not
create any right in any Person to continued employment with Grandpoint, PPBI
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or to any compensation or benefit.

 



 

6.12 _Appointment of Directors_. PPBI agrees to take all action necessary to
appoint or elect, effective as of the Effective Time, two individuals, each of
whom shall be mutually agreeable to PPBI and Grandpoint and one of whom shall
be Don M. Griffith, as directors of PPBI and Pacific Premier. Each individual
shall serve until the first annual meeting of stockholders of PPBI following
the Effective Time and until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
PPBI shall include such individuals on the list of nominees for director
presented by the PPBI Board and for which the PPBI Board shall solicit proxies
at the first annual meeting of stockholders of PPBI following the Effective
Time, provided, that such nomination and solicitation would not violate the
fiduciary duties of the PPBI Board.

 



 

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Grandpoint and PPBI shall give
prompt written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a failure
of any of the conditions provided for in Article VII.

 



 

6.14 _Estoppel Letters_. Grandpoint shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to PPBI at the Closing with respect to the real
estate (i) owned or leased by Grandpoint or a Grandpoint Subsidiary, an
estoppel letter dated as of the Closing in substantially the form of Annex E
from all tenants and (ii) leased by Grandpoint or a Grandpoint Subsidiary, an
estoppel letter dated as of the Closing in substantially the form of Annex F
from its lessor.

 



 

6.15 _Assumption of Indenture Obligations_. As of the Effective Time, PPBI
shall have assumed or caused one of its Subsidiaries to assume the obligations
under the Indenture. In connection therewith, PPBI and Grandpoint shall
execute and deliver any supplemental indentures or other documents reasonably
required to make such assumption effective.

 



      
 

 



 

6.16 _Antitakeover Statutes_. Each of PPBI and Grandpoint and their respective
Boards of Directors shall, if any state antitakeover statute or similar
statute becomes applicable to this Agreement and the Transaction, take all
action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Transaction may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the
Transaction.

 



 

6.17 _Consents_. Grandpoint shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, approvals,
waivers, non-objections and to deliver any notices necessary or advisable
pursuant to the terms of the Material Contracts as a result of the
Transaction.

 



 

6.18 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of PPBI and Grandpoint shall take all steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to exempt the conversion of shares of Grandpoint Common Stock into
shares of PPBI Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by
employees of Grandpoint who may become an officer or director of PPBI subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 **CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER**

 



 

7.01 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation to Effect the Merger_. The
respective obligation of each of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger
is subject to the fulfillment or, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
written waiver by the parties hereto at or prior to the Closing of each of the

determined, effective as of the date that is three (3) Business Days following

(i) The PPBI Average Share Price is greater than $45.655 (with a proportionate
adjustment in the event that outstanding shares of PPBI Common Stock shall be

and intentional breach of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal has been made (whether or
not conditional) to Grandpoint or its shareholders or any Person has publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
Proposal (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention shall
not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification) and thereafter (A)
this Agreement is terminated by PPBI pursuant to 8.01(c) or PPBI pursuant to

consummated (solely for purposes of this Section 8.02(b)(i)(B), the term
"Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal contained in Section 6.07(a) except that all references
to 10% shall be deemed references to 50%), then Grandpoint shall pay to PPBI a
fee equal to $23.0 million (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of next

Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of PPBI against Grandpoint and any
of its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with respect to the
breach of any covenant or agreement giving rise to such payment.

 



 

(c) Each party acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.02
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the other party would not have entered into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay the amounts
due pursuant to Section 8.02 and, in order to obtain such payment, the other
party commences a suit that results in a judgement against such party for the
amounts set forth in Section 8.02, the party failing to pay such amount due
shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal
relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section
8.02 at the prime lending rate as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

9.01 _Survival_. No representations, warranties, agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other than
agreements or covenants contained herein that by their express terms are to be
performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of this Agreement if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections
6.06(e), 8.02 and this Article IX, which shall survive any such termination).

after PPBIs receipt of Shareholder Approval, there may not be, without
further approval of Grandpoints shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement
that requires further approval under applicable law. For purposes of
clarification, an amendment of any date in Section 8.01(c) shall not require
further approval by any shareholders and if such amendment were deemed by law
to require further approval by the shareholders of Grandpoint, the receipt of
the Shareholder Approval will be deemed to have granted Grandpoint the
authority to amend such dates without such further approval.

agree not to assert, as a defense in any litigation, arbitration, claim or
other proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or of
any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such litigation,
arbitration, claim or other proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all litigation,
arbitration, claims or other proceedings shall be heard and determined in such
a Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the Person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such litigation,
arbitration, claim or other proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.06
or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY

 



      
 

 



 

UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and

Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Shareholder
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire
understanding of the parties hereto and thereto with reference to the
Transaction, and this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Support

supersede any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except
for the Indemnified Parties right to enforce PPBIs obligation under Section
6.10, which are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
Representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended

9.08 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section
9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on Grandpoint or PPBI, any term or
provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any

such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable
the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity
or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar
as practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this
Agreement.

 



 

9.09 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Except as provided in Section 8.02, it is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the
federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys fees or other costs are
incurred to secure performance of any of the obligations herein provided for,
or to establish damages for the breach thereof, or to obtain any other
appropriate relief, whether by way of prosecution or defense, the prevailing
party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs
incurred therein.

 



      
 

 



 

9.10 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or
Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." Whenever the words "as of the date hereof" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the day and year first
above written.

 



 

9.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

9.12 _Alternative Structure_. Subject to the proviso in the first sentence of
Section 9.02, PPBI may at any time modify the structure of the acquisition of
Grandpoint set forth herein, provided that (i) the Merger Consideration to be
paid to the holders of Grandpoint Common Stock is not thereby changed in kind
or reduced in amount as a result of such modification, (ii) such modifications
will not adversely affect the tax treatment to Grandpoints shareholders as a
result of receiving the Merger Consideration and (iii) such modification will
not jeopardize receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities
or impede or delay consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

into shares of PPBI Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares in the
manner set forth therein; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Investor owns the shares of Grandpoint Common Stock
identified on Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of
Grandpoint Common Stock subsequently acquired by the Investor during the term
of this Agreement, being referred to as the "Shares"); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , in order to induce PPBI to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
Investor has agreed to enter into and perform this Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , for good and valuable consideration, the receipt,
sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. The Investor agrees that, while this Agreement is in effect, at such time as Grandpoint conducts the Grandpoint Consent Solicitation, the Investor shall deliver a duly executed copy of the written consent set forth as Exhibit II to this Agreement (or cause such consent to be delivered) covering all the Shares that are beneficially owned by the Investor or as to which the Investor has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting.

 



 

2. _Transfer of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Prohibition on Transfers of Shares; Other Actions_. The Investor hereby
agrees, that while this Agreement is in effect, the Investor shall not,
without the prior written approval of PPBI, (i) sell, transfer, pledge,
encumber, distribute by gift or donation, or otherwise dispose of any of the
Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Shares) or any interest therein, whether by actual disposition, physical
settlement or effective economic disposition through hedging transactions,
derivative instruments or other means, except for charitable gifts or
donations where the recipient enters into a voting agreement binding the
recipient to vote its shares in the manner provided in Section 1 of this
Agreement; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Investor from
disposing of or surrendering Shares to Grandpoint in connection with the
vesting, settlement or exercise of Grandpoint Options, for the payment of
taxes thereon or the exercise price thereon or (ii) enter into any agreement,

hereunder will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under,
any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any order,
arbitration award, judgment or decree to which the Investor is a party or by
which the Investor is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which the

Section 2(a) hereof, through the term of this Agreement will be, owned

ownership" shall be interpreted in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Investor does not, and the performance by the Investor of its obligations
under this Agreement will not, require the Investor to obtain any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority except where the failure to obtain
such consent, approval, authorization or permit or make such filing or
notification would not prevent, materially impair or materially delay the

(f) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Investor, threatened against or
affecting the Investor or any of its affiliates before or by any Governmental

The Investor will comply with the provisions of Section 6.07(c) of the Merger Agreement as if it were Grandpoint.

 



 

6. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. The Investor acknowledges that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that, in such event, PPBI will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Investor agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that PPBI may have an adequate remedy at law. The Investor agrees that it will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with PPBIs seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

 **OF CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS OF**

 



 

 **GRANDPOINT CAPITAL, INC.**

   

 **Pursuant to Section 228 of the**

 

 **General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware**

   

Pursuant to Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL")
and the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of
Grandpoint Capital, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Grandpoint"), the
undersigned, the holder of shares of voting common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Grandpoint (the "Grandpoint Voting Common Stock"), does
hereby irrevocably consent as follows:

 



 

 ** _Adoption of the Merger Agreement and Related Matters_**

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the Board of Directors of Grandpoint (the "Grandpoint Board")
has (i) approved and declared advisable (A) the Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of February 9, 2018, by and between Grandpoint and
Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PPBI"), which is
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which,
among other things, Grandpoint will be merged with and into PPBI (the
"Merger"), (B) the Merger and (C) the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of
Grandpoints stockholders that Grandpoint enter into the Merger Agreement and
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, (iii) determined that the consideration to be paid to Grandpoints
stockholders in the Merger is fair to such stockholders and (iv) recommended
that Grandpoints stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the Merger Agreement was executed by the parties thereto on
February , 2018;

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the Merger Agreement provides that each share of Grandpoint
Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
(other than shares in respect of which appraisal rights have been properly
exercised) shall be cancelled and shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger
Agreement);

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the undersigned has reviewed the Merger Agreement and such other
information as the undersigned believed necessary to make an informed decision
concerning their vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; and

 



      
 

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the undersigned desires to waive any rights to appraisal of the
fair value of such stockholders shares of Grandpoint Common Stock and rights
to dissent from the Merger that the undersigned may have, whether pursuant to
the DGCL or otherwise.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions and agreements contemplated thereby, including the Merger, be,
and the same hereby are, adopted and approved in all respects.

 



 

 **FURTHER RESOLVED,** that the undersigned hereby irrevocably waives any
rights to appraisal of the fair value of such stockholders shares of
Grandpoint Common Stock and any rights to dissent from the Merger that the
undersigned may have, whether pursuant to the DGCL or otherwise.

 



 

 **FURTHER RESOLVED,** that the undersigned hereby agrees (on the
undersigneds own behalf and on behalf of the undersigneds successors-in-
interest, transferees or assignees) to forego participation as a plaintiff or
member of a plaintiff class in any action (including any class action) with
respect to any claim, direct, derivative or otherwise, based on the
undersigneds status as a stockholder of Grandpoint relating to the
negotiation, execution or delivery of this Written Consent or the Merger
Agreement or the consummation of (but not the failure to consummate) the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the undersigned does not waive, release or discharge
any claims relating to the right to receive the Merger Consideration under the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **FURTHER RESOLVED,** that PPBI may rely upon the foregoing waivers and
agreements as being binding in all respects against the undersigned.

 



 

The undersigned hereby waives compliance with any and all notice requirements
imposed by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
Grandpoint, Grandpoints Bylaws, the DGCL and any other applicable law. This
Written Consent is effective upon execution.

agree as follows:

any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares) or
any interest therein, whether by actual disposition, physical settlement or
effective economic disposition through hedging transactions, derivative
instruments or other means, except for charitable gifts or donations where the
recipient enters into a voting agreement binding the recipient to vote its
shares in the manner provided in Section 1 of this Agreement; provided, that
the foregoing shall not prohibit Shareholder from disposing of or surrendering
Shares to

 



      
 

 



 

Grandpoint in connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of
Grandpoint Options, for the payment of taxes thereon or the exercise price
thereon or, (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
any Person, or take any other action, that violates or conflicts with
Shareholders obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Shareholder hereby agrees that Shareholder
shall not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or enter into
any voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to any

and PPBI of the Grandpoint Shareholder Consents.

 



 

3. _Representations and Warranties of_ Shareholder. Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with PPBI as follows:

 



 

(a) _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter
into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Shareholder and assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by PPBI, constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

 



 

(c) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations hereunder will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party
or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which
Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Shareholder, except where such violation, conflict or default
would not prevent, materially impair or materially delay Shareholders
performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Ownership_. Shareholders Shares are, and, except as otherwise provided
for in Section 2(a) hereof, through the term of this Agreement will be, owned
beneficially and of record solely by Shareholder, except as otherwise
disclosed on Exhibit I hereto. Shareholder has title to the Shares, free and

beneficially or of record by him, her or it during the term of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "beneficial ownership" shall be
interpreted in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

(e) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations under this Agreement will not, require Shareholder to obtain any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(f) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Shareholder, threatened against or
affecting Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates before or by any
Governmental Authority that could reasonably be expected to materially impair
the ability of Shareholder to perform his, her or its obligations hereunder on
a timely basis.

 



 

4. _No Solicitation_. Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of this Agreement he, she or it shall not, and shall not instruct any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it not to, directly or indirectly take any of the actions that would result in a breach of clauses (i)-(vi) of Section 6.07(a) of the Merger Agreement. Shareholder agrees immediately to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than PPBI or its affiliates and representatives with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal and will take all necessary steps to inform any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it of the obligations undertaken by Shareholder pursuant to this Section 4. Nothing contained in this Section 4 shall prevent an Shareholder who is an officer or a member of the Grandpoint Board from discharging his or her fiduciary duties solely in his or her capacity as such an officer or director.

 



 

5. _Notice of Acquisitions; Proposals Regarding Prohibited Transactions_. Shareholder hereby agrees to notify PPBI promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in writing of the number of any additional shares of Grandpoint Common Stock or other securities of Grandpoint of which Shareholder acquires beneficial or record ownership on or after the date hereof. Shareholder will comply with the provisions of Section 6.07(c) of the Merger Agreement as if he, she or it were Grandpoint.

 



 

6. _Non-Solicitation_.(1)

 



 

(a) In the event Shareholder is not a Transferred Employee, Shareholder agrees
that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Shareholder
will not directly or indirectly:

  (1) The Non-Solicitation provisions will only be included in the Shareholder
Agreements being entered into with Grandpoint and Grandpoint Bank executive
officers not being retained by PPBI.

 



       
 

 



 

(i) solicit (other than general solicitations through newspapers or other
media of general circulation, or the engagement of professional search firms,
not targeted at such employees) any employees of Grandpoint or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing ("Grandpoint Employees"); provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to any Grandpoint Employee (Y) who does not
become an employee of PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries or is terminated by PPBI
or any of its Subsidiaries without cause on or after the Closing Date; or (Z)
whose employment terminated more than six months prior to the time that such
Grandpoint Employee is first solicited for employment following the Closing
Date (other than with respect to solicitations permitted by the terms of this
Section 6(a)(i)); or

 



 

(ii) knowingly (A) induce, persuade, encourage or influence or attempt to
induce, persuade, encourage or influence any Person having a business
relationship with Grandpoint or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, to
discontinue, reduce or restrict such relationship with PPBI or its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, provided that nothing herein shall
prevent Shareholder from conducting or engaging in business with any Person
who was not solicited in violation of Section 6(a)(ii)(B), or (B) solicit or
target the deposits, loans or other products and services from or to Persons
who were depositors, borrowers or customers of Grandpoint or its Subsidiaries
on the date of this Agreement, and/or as of the Closing Date, whether by
personal contact, by telephone, by facsimile, by mail or other form of
solicitation or communication, or in any other way except for general
solicitations that are directed to the general public and not directed
specifically to Persons who were depositors, borrowers or customers of
Grandpoint or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, or as of the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for purposes of clarity,
nothing herein shall prohibit the Shareholder from exercising Shareholders
discretion relating to Shareholders personal and business banking
relationships.

 



 

(b) Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the business conducted by
Grandpoint and its Subsidiaries is highly competitive and that the covenants
made by the Shareholder in this Section 6 are made as a necessary inducement
for PPBI to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of this Section 6 shall be enforced to the
fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. It is expressly understood and
agreed that although Shareholder and PPBI each consider the restrictions
contained in this Section 6 to be reasonable, if a final determination is made
by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or
territory or any other restriction contained in this Section 6 is
unenforceable against any party, the provisions of this Section 6 shall be
deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such
maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be
enforceable.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement
are necessary to protect PPBIs legitimate business interests and to protect
the value of PPBIs acquisition of Grandpoint. Shareholder warrants that these
provisions will not unreasonably interfere with his or her ability to earn a
living or to pursue his or her occupation and the Shareholder has the means to
support himself or herself and his or her dependents and the provisions of
this Section 6 will not impair such ability in any manner whatsoever.

 



 

(d) Shareholder will not, at any time during the two-year period referred to
in Subsection 6(a) of this Agreement, disparage PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any
of its Affiliates, or the business conducted by PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any
of their Affiliates, or any stockholder, member, director, manager, officer,
employee or agent of PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates.

 



 

7. _Specific Performance and Remedies_.

Dear :

 



 

In connection with the acquisition of Grandpoint Capital, Inc. ("Grandpoint")
and its subsidiary Grandpoint Bank ("Grandpoint Bank") by Pacific Premier
Bancorp, Inc. ("Assignee") pursuant to a merger of Grandpoint with and into
Assignee and a merger of Grandpoint Bank with and into Pacific Premier Bank, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Assignee (collectively, the "Merger"), and the
assignment of the above referenced Lease, the undersigned Tenant hereby
certifies to Assignee that the following statements are true, correct and
complete as of the date hereof:

 



 

1. Tenant is the tenant under the Lease for the Premises. There have been no amendments, modifications or revisions to the Lease, and there are no agreements of any kind between Landlord and Tenant regarding the Premises, except as provided in the attached Lease.

 



 

2. Attached hereto as _Schedule A_ is a true, correct and complete copy of the Lease which has been duly authorized and executed by Tenant and which is in full force and effect.

 



 

3. Tenant has accepted and is in sole possession of the Premises and is presently occupying the Premises. The Lease has not been assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by Tenant, and no sublease, concession agreement or license, covering the Premises, or any portion of the Premises, has been entered into by Tenant. If the landlord named in the Lease is other than Landlord, Tenant has received notice of the assignment to Landlord of the landlords interest in the Lease and Tenant recognizes Landlord as the landlord under the Lease.

 



 

4. No rent under the Lease has been paid more than one (1) month in advance, and no other sums or security deposits have been deposited with Landlord, except in the amount of $ . (If none, state "NONE"). Tenant is not entitled to rent concessions or free rent.

 



      
 

 



 

5. All conditions and obligations of Landlord relating to completion of tenant improvements and making the Premises ready for occupancy by Tenant have been satisfied or performed and all other conditions and obligations under the Lease to be satisfied or performed by Landlord as of the date hereof have been fully satisfied or performed.

 



 

6. There exists no defense to, or right of offset against, enforcement of the Lease by Landlord. Neither Landlord nor Tenant is in default under the Lease and no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, could result in such a default.

 



 

7. Tenant has not received any notice of any present violation of any federal, state, county or municipal laws, regulations, ordinances, orders or directives relating to the use or condition of the Premises.

 



 

8. Except as specifically stated herein, Tenant has not been granted (a) any option to extend the term of the Lease; (b) any option to expand the Premises or to lease additional space within the Premises; (c) any right to terminate the Lease prior to its stated expiration; or (d) any option or right of first refusal to purchase the Premises or any part thereof.

 



 

9. Tenant acknowledges having been notified that Landlords interest in and to the Lease has been, or will be, assigned to Assignee. Until further notice from Landlord, however, Tenant will continue to make all payments under the Lease to Landlord and otherwise look solely to Landlord for the performance of the Landlords obligations under the Lease.

 



 

The agreements and certifications set forth herein are made with the knowledge
and intent that Assignee will rely on them in purchasing the Premises, and
Assignees successors and assigns may rely upon them for that purpose.
