delivered to the Buyer within seventy-five (75) days following the Closing

Representative, in writing, prior to the end of such 20-day period (an
"ALLOCATION OBJECTION NOTICE"), setting forth the Buyer\'s proposed
Allocation Schedule and specifying, in reasonable detail, any good faith
dispute as to the Sellers\' Representative\'s Allocation Schedule. If prior
to the conclusion of such 20-day period, the Buyer notifies the Sellers\'
Representative in writing that it will not provide any Allocation Objection
Notice or if the Buyer does not deliver an Allocation Objection Notice within
such 20-day period, then the proposed Allocation Schedule shall be deemed
final and conclusive and binding upon each of the parties hereto (a "FINAL
ALLOCATION SCHEDULE"). The Sellers\' Representative and the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objection by the Buyer to the
proposed Allocation Schedule and to agree upon a Final Allocation Schedule.
If within 10 days after the Sellers\' Representative receives an Allocation
Objection Notice the Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative have not resolved
all objections and agreed upon a Final Allocation Schedule, the Buyer and the
Sellers\' Representative shall engage a mutually acceptable independent
accounting firm of national recognition (the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM")
to determine whether the Sellers\' Representative\'s position with respect to
any remaining disputed items, as set forth in the proposed Allocation
Schedule, are reasonable. Any disputed items that are so determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm to be reasonable shall be included in the Final
Allocation Schedule as proposed by the Sellers\' Representative. Any disputed
items that are so determined by the Independent Accounting Firm not to be
reasonable shall be adjusted by the Independent Accounting Firm to be
reasonable, and such adjusted amounts shall be included in the Final
Allocation Schedule. The Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative shall have
the opportunity to present their position with respect to any disputed items
to the Independent Accounting Firm and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm, within 20 days
after its selection, to make the above-described determinations and to
prepare a Final Allocation Schedule in accordance therewith. Unless the Buyer
and the Sellers\' Representative otherwise agree, such Final Allocation
Schedule shall not modify items previously agreed. The fees and disbursements
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by the Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Members that held issued and outstanding Membership
Interests as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (pro rata in
proportion to the respective amounts paid to such Members pursuant to Section
3.2(a)), on the other hand; provided, however, that the Buyer may (but shall
not be obligated to) elect, at any time, to withdraw all (but not less than
all) of the aggregate amount of such fees and disbursements allocable to such

person acting on behalf of such a plan; or (iii) an entity whose assets
include the assets of such a plan, within the meaning of ERISA and applicable

material respects with ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated under either ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code in connection with

Subsidiaries is the general partner or managing member, that are not intended
to constitute "plan assets" under 29 C.F.R. 2510.3-101 (the "PLAN ASSET

be determined to be "plan assets" for purposes of the Plan Asset
Regulation.   (d) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries provides Investment Management Services to (i)
any issuer or other Person that is required to be registered as an
investment company (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act) under

(within the meaning of the Investment Company Act) under the Investment
Company Act.   (e) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, no exemptive orders, "no-action" letters or
similar exemptions or regulatory relief have been obtained, nor are any
requests pending therefor, by or with respect to either of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, any holder of Membership Interests or any employee of any such
Person in connection with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or to the Knowledge of the Company, by any Client of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the provision of Investment Management
Services to such Client by the Company and its Subsidiaries.   (f) Section

complete list of (i) the Hedge Fund Documents (it being understood that the

Agreement) and (ii) the CDO Documents (it being understood that the
Company shall be permitted to provide the Buyer with a supplement to Section
4.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter to reflect the entering into, or
amendment, supplement or other modification of, any CDO Document after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date in compliance with this Agreement).
The Company provided the Buyer with true and correct copies of all CDO
Documents and Hedge Fund Documents as of the date hereof (and as of the
Closing will have provided true and correct copies of any CDO Documents
and/or Hedge Fund Documents entered into after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing Date in compliance with this Agreement), and the offering
circulars or memoranda included in such CDO Documents and Hedge Fund
Documents did not at the time such CDO or Hedge Fund issued any securities
related to such CDO Documents and Hedge Fund Documents contain any untrue
statement of a material fact concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or omit to state a material fact concerning the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.    28  Each of the CDO Documents and the Hedge Fund Documents
to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party, to the extent
applicable, is in full force and effect and binding upon the Company or its
Subsidiary party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the other
parties thereto, except as (i) limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and
(ii) the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
would be subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in
material default under any CDO Document or Hedge Fund Document to which it is
a party, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has any event occurred which,
with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, would give rise to
such a material default. Except as set forth in Section 4.12(f) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of the Company, each of the CDOs
was in compliance as of the Base Date with each of its overcollateralization
tests and interest coverage tests.   (g) Each of the Client Consents
obtained in accordance with Section 6.8 (including each of the Consents
included in the determination of whether the condition contained in Section
7.9 has been satisfied) will, as of the Closing Date, have been duly obtained
under all applicable Law and the requirements of the applicable Advisory
Contract.   (h) Nothing in this Section 4.12 (other than the calculation of
the Base Date AUM) is intended to address any matters with respect to
the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.   4.13 Non-Contravention; Consents

Company Disclosure Letter, violate the Existing Operating Agreement or any
comparable organizational instruments of any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries;   (b) require the Company to obtain any consents,
approvals, authorizations or actions of, or make any filings with or give any
notices to, any Governmental Authorities or any other Person, except for (i)

and the Company Consents and Notices are obtained or made, violate or result
in the breach of any of the material terms and conditions of, cause the
termination of or give any other contracting party the right to terminate, or
constitute (or with notice or lapse of time, or both, constitute) a default
under, or result in the acceleration of any monetary liabilities under, any
Material Contract or material Permit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets are bound, or result in the creation of any Lien, other than a
Permitted Lien, upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any Material Contract or material
Permit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of their respective properties or assets are bound, except for any such
violations, breaches, terminations, defaults, accelerations or creations
under any Material Contracts that would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect; or   (d) assuming all of the Client Consents and the
Company Consents and Notices are obtained or made, violate or result in the
breach of any applicable Orders or Laws of any Governmental Authorities.

Contract has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the other
parties thereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company, enforceable against the

Nothing in this Section 4.17 is intended to address any Legal Proceedings or
Orders that are the subject of any other representation or warranty contained
in this Article IV and are disclosed pursuant to such other representation or

Company and its Subsidiaries that are due have been timely and fully paid.
Except as set forth in Section 4.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the

respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes, and have duly and timely withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority all material amounts required to be so withheld and paid

Subsidiaries have not filed Tax Returns that it is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for material Taxes on
any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than
Permitted Liens. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) pursuant to any indemnification, allocation or sharing
agreement with respect to Taxes that could give rise to a material payment or
indemnification obligation (other than agreements among the Company and its
Subsidiaries and other than customary Tax indemnifications contained in
credit or other commercial agreements the primary purpose of which does not
relate to Taxes). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section

of the Code has received a favorable determination letter that has not been
revoked from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that each such
Benefit Plan satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code
and each related trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
Benefit Plan or trust. Each Benefit Plan has been maintained in substantial

made on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the financial
statements.   (f) Except as set forth in Section 4.19(f) of the

by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another
event, (i) entitle any current or former employee, consultant or officer of

Sellers\' Representative for the benefit of, among others, the Company and
its Subsidiaries).   4.25 Books and Records. Since July 22, 2004, the

857(f), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code (or any comparable provision of state or

company under the Investment Company Act.   5.7 Non-Contravention. The

countersigned indicating such CDO Consent Party\'s consent (or otherwise
indicated its consent in writing) to the assignment (or deemed assignment) of
the applicable Advisory Contract resulting from the "change of control" of
DCM contemplated by this Agreement, a second letter (each, a "FOLLOW-UP CDO
CONSENT REQUEST LETTER") and (iii) to each Client to whom an Initial Hedge
Fund Consent Request was sent but who has not by such date returned documents
or other materials evidencing that the Hedge Fund Resolutions have been duly
adopted by a majority of the members of the board of directors or comparable
governing body of such Hedge Fund, a second communication (each, a "FOLLOW-UP
HEDGE FUND CONSENT REQUEST"). Each Follow-Up Client Consent Letter, Follow-Up
CDO Consent Request Letter and Follow-Up Hedge Fund Consent Request shall
request the applicable consents described in Section 6.8(a).   (c) With
respect to any Advisory Contract (other than Advisory Contracts with New
Clients), the Client Consent shall be deemed given for purposes of Section
7.9 in the event that such Client or such CDO Consent Party, as applicable,
has returned to DCM an executed Initial Client Consent Request Letter or a
Follow-Up Client Consent Request Letter, or an executed Initial CDO Consent
Request Letter or a Follow-Up CDO Consent Request Letter (or
otherwise indicated its consent in writing), or documents or other materials
evidencing the due adoption of the Hedge Fund Resolutions by a majority of
the members of the board of directors or comparable governing body of such
Hedge Fund, or by other reasonable means which shall be comparably effective
in form and substance to confirm the consent of such Client or such CDO
Consent Party, as the case may be, to the assignment (or deemed assignment)
of such Advisory Contract resulting from the "change of control" of DCM
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to any Advisory Contract (other than Advisory Contracts with Hedge Funds or
New Clients) that does not, by its terms or under applicable Law, require the
written consent of the Client party thereto or specified CDO Consent Parties
(as specified in Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), as
applicable, to an assignment (or deemed assignment) of such Advisory
Contract, the Client Consent shall be deemed given for purposes of Section
7.9 (notwithstanding the fact that such Client or such CDO Consent Parties,
as applicable, shall have failed to return an Initial Client Consent   
53  Request Letter or a Follow-Up Client Consent Request Letter, or an
Initial CDO Consent Request Letter or a Follow-Up CDO Consent Request Letter,
as applicable, countersigned indicating the consent of such Client or such
CDO Consent Party (or otherwise failed to indicate its consent in writing),
as applicable, to the assignment (or deemed assignment) of such Advisory
Contract resulting from the "change of control" of DCM contemplated by this
Agreement) 15 days after the date on which such Follow-Up Client Consent
Request Letter or Follow-Up CDO Consent Letter, as applicable, was sent to
such Client, such CDO Consent Party or such trustee, as applicable, if such
Client or such CDO Consent Party, as applicable, has not objected in a
writing received by DCM to the assignment or deemed assignment of such
Advisory Contract resulting from the "change of control" of DCM contemplated
by this Agreement and has continued to accept Investment Management Services
from DCM for such 15 day period.   (d) With respect to any Advisory Contract
entered into after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Company
shall cause DCM to notify (i) the Client (each, a "NEW CLIENT") party to such
Advisory Contract (other than a CDO) and (ii) in the case of each New Client
that is a CDO, each Person whose consent is required to an assignment of such
Advisory Contract related to such CDO (each a "NEW CDO CONSENT PARTY") or the
trustee with respect to such CDO for distribution by such trustee to such New
CDO Consent Parties, of the "change of control" of DCM contemplated by this
Agreement and the "assignment" (or deemed assignment) of such Advisory
Contract resulting from such "change of control" and shall request the
written consent of such New Client and, in the case of any New Client that is
a CDO, each of the New CDO Consent Parties required under such Advisory
Contract to consent to an assignment of such Advisory Contract to such
assignment (or deemed assignment) of such Advisory Contract at the time such
Advisory Contract is entered into, either by means of a notification and
written consent substantially similar to the Initial Client Consent Request
Letter, the Initial CDO Consent Request Letter or written evidence of the due
adoption by a majority of the members of the board of directors or comparable
governing body of such Hedge Fund or by other reasonable means which shall be
comparably effective in form and substance to confirm the consent of such New
Client or New CDO Consent Party, as the case may be.   (e) The Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consents from the Clients, the New Clients,
the CDO Consent Parties and the New CDO Consent Parties in the manner
contemplated by this Section 6.8; provided, that neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required or obligated to pay any consideration
to, or agree to any modification of any aspect of its relationship with, any
Person from or to whom any such consents are requested. Except in accordance
with the provisions of Section 6.3(c), prior to the Closing, the Buyer agrees
that it will not (and it will not cause or permit any of its Affiliates to)
contact, in writing or otherwise, any Client or New Client of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or any Person who acts as an adviser or "gatekeeper"
for any such Client or New Client) or any CDO Consent Party or New CDO
Consent Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior approval of the Company.    54   6.9
Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting; NYSE Listing.   (a) As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement (but in no event more than
30 days after the date of this Agreement), the Buyer, in cooperation with the
Company, shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement.
The Buyer shall respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and shall
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest
practicable time after the resolution of any such comments. The Buyer shall
also use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning the Company and the holders of
Membership Interests as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action. The Buyer shall notify the Company promptly upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and
of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply the Company
with copies of all correspondence between the Buyer or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.
The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents
that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under this Section 6.9(a) to comply in all material respects with
all applicable Laws. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of
such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of the Buyer,
such amendment or supplement.   (b) The Buyer, acting through its Board of
Directors, shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as
practicable the Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and
voting upon the Stock Issuance. The Buyer covenants that, the Proxy Statement
shall include the recommendation (the "BOARD RECOMMENDATION") of the Board of
Directors of the Buyer and of the Special Committee that the stockholders of
the Buyer approve the Stock Issuance. The Buyer shall take all action that is
both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor
of the Stock Issuance and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or
advisable to secure the Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Buyer may adjourn or postpone the
Stockholders\' Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Buyer\'s
stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Stockholders Meeting.   (c) The Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.   55   (d) Neither the Board of
Directors of the Buyer nor the Special Committee shall withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company,
the Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of advisability by
such Board of Directors of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Merger).   6.10 Preservation of Records;
Post-Closing Access to Information and Cooperation.   (a) The Buyer, at its
own expense, shall preserve and keep records held by it or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a period of seven (7) years from the
Closing Date, during which time the Buyer shall make such records available
to the Sellers\' Representative as the Sellers\' Representative requires. The
Buyer may destroy such records after that time, but only after the Buyer
gives ninety (90) days prior written notice to the Sellers\' Representative
and details the contents of the records to be destroyed; the Sellers\'
Representative shall have the option to take possession of the records at its
own expense within ninety (90) days of the date of such notice by the Buyer
in accordance with Section 6.10(b).   (b) The Buyer (including, for the
purpose of this Section 6.10(b), the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Closing) shall provide the Sellers\' Representative and its professional
advisors with reasonable access to the Buyer\'s books and records if
reasonably required in connection with any litigation, investigation, Tax
audit, discovery or similar proceeding, or in the preparation of Tax Returns,
and shall prepare, at the expense of the Members who are or could reasonably
be expected to be affected by such litigation, investigation, Tax audit,
discovery or similar proceeding or for whom such Tax Returns are to be
prepared and, in any such case, who held issued and outstanding Membership
Interests as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (pro rata in
proportion to the respective amounts paid to such Members pursuant to Section
3.2(a) in relation to the aggregate amounts paid to all such Members pursuant
to Section 3.2(a)), such schedules and other materials as may be reasonably
requested by the Sellers\' Representative in connection with any of the
foregoing and deliver, at the expense of the Members who are or
could reasonably be expected to be affected by such litigation,
investigation, Tax audit, discovery or similar proceeding or for whom such
Tax Returns are to be prepared and, in any such case, who held issued and
outstanding Membership Interests as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (pro rata in proportion to the respective amounts paid to such Members
pursuant to Section 3.2(a) in relation to the aggregate amounts paid to all
such Members pursuant to Section 3.2(a)), such schedules and materials to the
Sellers\' Representative and its professional advisors at such times as may
be reasonably requested by the Sellers\' Representative; provided, however,
that, in either case, the Buyer may (but shall not be obligated to) elect, at
any time, to withdraw all (but not less than all) of the aggregate amount of
any such expenses allocable to all Members who held issued and outstanding
Membership Interests as immediately prior to the Effective Time from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If the
Sellers\' Representative shall request the assistance (including testimony)
of employees of the Buyer in connection with any litigation, investigation,
tax audit, discovery, similar proceeding or    56  claim, the Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to make such employees available for a
reasonable period of time.   (c) The Sellers\' Representative shall exercise
its rights under this Section 6.10 to the extent reasonably requested to do
so by Members who hold issued and outstanding Membership Interests as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time constituting at least 20% of the
Fully Diluted Percentage Interests.   6.11 Termination of Related Party
Transactions.   (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, all Contracts between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Triarc Related Party, on the other
hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing, and all liabilities thereunder
shall thereupon be discharged and released. This covenant is intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Triarc Related Parties
as if such Persons were parties hereto.   (b) On the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall change its name to eliminate the reference therein to "Triarc" in
accordance with the terms of the Trademark License Agreement, dated as of
November 24, 2004, by and among Triarc Companies, Inc., the Company and the
Buyer.   6.12 Employee Matters.   (a) On and after the Closing, the Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor in
accordance with their terms all existing employment, severance, consulting
and salary continuation agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director, employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall preclude the Buyer from having the right to terminate
the employment of any employee, with or without cause.   (b) On and after
the Closing until the first anniversary thereof, the Buyer shall either
continue the Benefit Plans (including any severance plan or arrangement but
excluding any equity-based plan or arrangement) and compensation practices of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or shall provide, or cause the Company or
its Subsidiaries to provide, benefits and compensation practices to employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the benefits provided under the Benefit Plans and compensation
practices applicable to such employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable immediately prior to the Closing.   (c) The
Buyer shall assume the obligation to pay to the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries any bonuses, to the extent such bonuses are accrued, that
would have been payable to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, in
accordance with the provisions of the policy, plan,    57  arrangement,
program, practice or agreement under which any such bonuses would have been
paid in accordance with past practices.   (d) From and after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall be responsible for complying with the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all
"qualifying events" (as such term is defined in Section 4980B of the Code)
occurring prior to, or on or after, the Closing Date with respect to any
current or former "covered employee" (as such term is defined in Section
4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any related
"qualified beneficiary" (as such term is defined in Section 4980B of the
Code), including, for the avoidance of doubt, those former covered employees
(and their qualified beneficiaries) who terminate their employment with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.   (e) From and after
the Closing Date, and to the extent not otherwise addressed in the foregoing
Section 6.12(d), the Buyer shall be responsible with respect to current and
former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their beneficiaries
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those former employees (and their
beneficiaries) who terminate their employment with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date) for compliance with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, and any other applicable
Law, including any requirement to provide for and discharge any and all
notifications, benefits and liabilities to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Governmental Authorities that might be imposed as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise.   6.13 Officers and Directors.   (a) The Company shall use
its reasonable efforts to deliver to the Buyer the resignations of all
members of the Board of Directors of the Company requested by the Buyer at
least three Business Days prior to the Closing from their positions as
directors of the Company immediately prior to the Closing.   (b) The Buyer
agrees that, for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, neither the
Existing Operating Agreement nor any other comparable organizational
instruments of the Company\'s Subsidiaries shall be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who on the date immediately prior to the Closing
Date are or were directors, officers, agents or employees of the Company, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise entitled to indemnification,
advancement of expenses or exculpation pursuant to the Existing Operating
Agreement or any other comparable organizational instrument of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries (each a "DIRECTOR AND/OR OFFICER INDEMNIFIED PARTY").   (c)
Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under the
Existing Operating Agreement or any other comparable organizational
instrument of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or any other Contract, but without
duplication thereof, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Buyer shall, or   
58  shall cause the Surviving LLC to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Director and/or Officer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
losses, liabilities or damages and reasonable attorneys\' fees, court costs
and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party is or was an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, of
the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Director and/or Officer
Indemnified Party\'s service, at or prior to the Effective Time, at the
request of, or to represent the interests of, the Company as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise including any charitable or not-
for-profit public service organization or trade association or (iii) matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in addition to any rights provided
in the Surviving LLC\'s organizational instruments, (x) subject to applicable
Law, each Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of reasonable expenses (including attorneys\' fees
and disbursements) incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation from the Buyer or the Surviving LLC within 10
Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving LLC from the Director
and/or Officer Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification and
(y) neither the Buyer nor the Surviving LLC shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action,
suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could
be sought by such Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party hereunder) unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such Director
and/or Officer Indemnified Party otherwise consents.   (d) The Buyer agrees
that, for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, (i) the Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Surviving LLC to, obtain extended reporting or tail
coverage on, obtain a substitute directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy for, or continue to maintain, the directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy maintained by the Company as of the date hereof
for the benefit of those persons who are covered by such policy immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) the Buyer shall continue to maintain the
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by the Buyer
as of the date hereof for the benefit of those persons who are covered by
such policy immediately prior to the Closing, in each case, on terms
and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured
with respect to claims arising from acts or omissions arising prior to and
including the Closing than are currently in effect; provided, that such
extended reporting    59  or tail coverage or substitute or existing
policy can be obtained and maintained on commercially reasonable terms and at
a cost to the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, not greater than 200
percent of the aggregate annual premium for the directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy maintained by the Company or the Buyer, as
applicable, on the date hereof; provided, further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Buyer shall be
obligated to obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.   (e) The Buyer agrees that, if the
Surviving LLC merges into, consolidates with, is converted into or transfers
all or substantially all of its assets to another Person, then and in each
such case, the Buyer shall make proper provision so that the surviving or
resulting Person or the transferee in such transaction (i) provides rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the Director and/or Officer
Indemnified Parties on terms not materially less favorable to the Director
and/or Officer Indemnified Parties than those contained in the Existing
Operating Agreement and (ii) assumes the obligations of the Buyer and the
Surviving LLC under this Section 6.13.   (f) Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.13 shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.   6.14 Release. Effective as of the Closing
Date, Buyer and the Surviving LLC, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates and each of their respective successors and assigns (each, a
"RELEASOR"), hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, each of the Members, managers and each of their
respective past or present officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
partners, members, managers and each of their successors and assigns (each, a
"RELEASEE") of, from and against any and all actions, causes of action,
claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind,
nature and description whatsoever, which such Releasor or its successors or
assigns ever had, now has or may have with respect to any acts or omissions
prior to the Closing Date of any such Releasee with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, other than for fraud, bad faith or willful
misconduct and the matter referred to in Item 2 of Section 6.1(b)(ix) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (which will be assigned to the Members prior to the
Closing) which shall not be released pursuant to this Section 6.14. Each
Releasor agrees not to assert any claim covered by this Section 6.14 against
any Releasee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Releasor retains, and does
not release, its rights and interests under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.   6.15 Tax Matters.

and authority granted to it or him, as applicable, as Tax    60  Matters

before the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed (taking into
account any applicable extensions), and no such Tax Return or amended Tax
Return shall be filed without the prior written consent of the Sellers\'
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), (d) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the parties shall treat the Merger as a fully
taxable sale of Membership Interests by the holders thereof and a purchase of
Membership Interests by the owners of Buyer Sub, file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with such treatment and take no position contrary thereto
unless required to do so by a change in applicable Tax Laws or a good faith
resolution of a Tax contest, and (e) any and all Tax allocation or Tax
sharing agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any other Person, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor

any such agreement for any past or future period.   6.16 Financing.   (a)
Each of the Buyer and Buyer Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain an executed commitment letter from one or more financial
institutions in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and
the Sellers\' Representative (the "DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER") to provide the
Buyer and Buyer Sub with debt financing in an amount sufficient to
satisfy all of the Buyer\'s and Buyer Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (x) to pay the full amount of the
payments due at the Closing, (y) to refinance any Debt of the Company to be
refinanced and pay all fees, penalties and premiums related thereto, and (z)
to pay all expenses in connection with the Merger and the transactions

conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to the Buyer, Buyer Sub or any of their
Affiliates in such definitive agreements that are within their or such
Affiliates\' control and (iii) consummate the Financing contemplated by the

becomes unavailable on terms and conditions consistent with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Buyer and Buyer Sub shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing, including from
alternative sources, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event (the "ALTERNATIVE DEBT FINANCING"). The Buyer or Buyer Sub shall
give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any breach by   
61  any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any termination of the
Debt Commitment Letter. The Buyer or Buyer Sub shall keep the Company
informed on a current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Financing and shall not permit any amendment or modification

that the Buyer may agree to amend the Debt Commitment Letter to provide for
the assignment of a portion of the debt commitment to additional agents or
arrangers and granting such persons approval rights with respect to certain
matters as are customarily granted to additional agents or arrangers).  
(b) The Company shall provide reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer or
Buyer Sub (provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business of the Company, cause any representation
or warranty in this Agreement to be breached, cause any closing condition set
forth in Article VIII to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause the breach
of this Agreement), including (i) participation in meetings,
drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish the Buyer or Buyer Sub and its financing
sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company
as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer or Buyer Sub, (iii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Buyer, Buyer Sub and its
financing sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document for any of
the Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of the Buyer, Buyer Sub and
its financing sources for any of the Financing, (v) using commercially
reasonable efforts to provide and execute such documents as may be reasonably

solvency matters and consents of accountants for use of their reports in
an offering document relating to the Financing, (vi) using commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral (vii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to participate in "road shows" with Buyer,
Buyer Sub and its financing sources as may be reasonably requested by the

Buyer or Buyer Sub. In no event shall the Company be required to pay any
commitment or similar fee, pledge any collateral, or incur any liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Closing. The Buyer or Buyer Sub
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Affiliates in
connection with all such cooperation, including the fees and expenses of
outside legal counsel and auditors. Other than in the instance of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by the Company or any of its Affiliates, the
Buyer and Buyer Sub shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and its Affiliates and each of their representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith.   62   6.17 Escrow Agreement;

and warranties as may be reasonably requested by Hunton and Williams LLP as a
condition to the issuance of the opinion referred to in Section 8.11.

Shares. The Buyer, acting through its Board of Directors, shall take all
actions necessary or desirable to exempt, pursuant to the Buyer\'s Charter,
the Members that held issued and outstanding Membership Interests as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, their respective Affiliates and
the successive transferees of any of the foregoing from the "Stock Ownership
Limit" contained in the Buyer\'s Charter to the extent necessary to allow
such Members, their respective Affiliates and the successive transferees of
any of the foregoing to own the Buyer Common Stock and/or options with

the proposed surviving, merged or acquired corporation, any transaction

(ii) solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of

The Company agrees not to release any third party from the confidentiality

For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on, (x) in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below, the second anniversary of the Closing Date
and (y) in the case of clause (iv) below, the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, (the "RESTRICTED PERIOD"), the Sellers\' Representative shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (collectively, "RESTRICTED
PERSONS") not to, directly or indirectly:   (i) own, manage, operate,
control or participate in the  ownership, management, operation or control
of, or render services to,  any business, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form  or otherwise, that competes with the
business of, or provides services  similar to the services provided by, the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (a "RESTRICTED BUSINESS"); provided,
however, that the  restrictions contained in this Section 6.20(a)(i) shall
not restrict  the acquisition by the Sellers\' Representative or any of its 
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, of less than 5% of the  outstanding
capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a  Restricted
Business;   (ii) take any action with the intention of diverting from the 
Company or any controlled Affiliate of the Company any funds or  investment
accounts with respect to which the Company or any controlled  Affiliate of
the Company is providing Investment Management Services;   (iii) solicit or
attempt to solicit any Person to cease doing  business with the Company who,
to the knowledge (whether actual  knowledge or knowledge that such Restricted
Person should have  possessed under the circumstances) of such Restricted
Person, is or has  been a customer, supplier, licensor, licensee or other
business  relation of the Company at any time (A) up to the date hereof or
(B)  during the applicable Restricted Period; or    64   (iv) induce,
hire, employ, attempt to hire or employ or  solicit any person employed by or
providing consulting services to the  Company or any of its controlled

months preceding such hiring or  employment or attempted hiring or employment
(excluding for all  purposes of this Section 6.20(a)(iv), secretaries,
drivers and persons  holding similar positions).   (b) The covenants and
undertakings contained in this Section 6.20 relate to matters which are of a
special, unique and extraordinary character and a violation of any of the
terms of this Section 6.20 will cause irreparable injury to the Buyer, the
amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot
be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of
this Section 6.20 will be inadequate. Therefore, the Buyer will be entitled
to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section 6.20
without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond
whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this Section 6.20 are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which the Buyer
may have hereunder or at law or in equity.   (c) The parties hereto agree
that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable
judgment determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical
area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this
Section 6.20 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a
lesser time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant
feature which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and
not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable party.  
(d) For the avoidance of doubt, "Restricted Persons" shall not be deemed to
include any Person other than the Sellers\' Representative and
its Subsidiaries and shall not be deemed to include (by way of illustration
and not limitation) Trian Fund Management, L.P. or any funds and accounts
managed by it, or any other Affiliate of the Sellers\' Representative that is
not a Subsidiary of the Sellers\' Representative.   6.21 Distribution and

prior to the Effective Time, to each Member that holds issued and outstanding

Diluted Percentage Interests, all of the shares of Buyer Common Stock that
are held by the Company and its Subsidiaries at such time (other than any
such shares that have been granted as restricted stock awards to employees of
DCM); provided, that no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be
distributed to any such Member and each such Member\'s allocable portion of
such distribution shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock. The Company and the Buyer shall take such actions as
are necessary to accelerate the vesting and transferability of such shares of
Buyer Common Stock so that such shares shall be fully vested and transferable
under the Deerfield Triarc Capital Corp. Stock Incentive Plan    65  and
related stock award agreements as of the time immediately prior to
their distribution as provided in the preceding sentence.   6.22 DFP

respective Fully Diluted Percentage Interests), (i) first, the amount of any
actual out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries after the date hereof in connection with DFP, and (ii)
second, one-half of the first $10,000,000 of gross proceeds received by the

Effective Time (pro rata in proportion to their respective Fully Diluted
Percentage Interests), on the one hand, and the Buyer on the other hand, the
amount of any out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and prior to the Closing and by the
Surviving LLC or any of its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing, in each
case, in connection with DFP, pro rata in proportion to the respective
amounts so incurred, and (ii) the Surviving LLC shall pay to the Members that
held issued and outstanding Membership Interests as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (pro rata in proportion to their respective Fully Diluted

received by the Surviving LLC or any of its Subsidiaries from such
transaction.   (b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that,

granted hereunder any right whatsoever to determine or influence in any way,

applicable date in which case such representation and warranty shall be 
correct as of such date);   (ii) any and all Losses based upon, attributable
to or  resulting from the breach of any covenant or other agreement on the 
part of the Company under this Agreement;   (iii) any Unpaid Expenses that
are Other Expenses required to  be paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries;   (iv) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or 
resulting from any claim asserted by any Member that held issued and 
outstanding Membership Interests as of immediately prior to the  Effective
Time that the allocation of the Closing Date Aggregate Cash  Consideration
and the Closing Date Aggregate Share Consideration to  such Member as
provided for in this Agreement violates the terms of the  Existing Operating
Agreement;   (v) any and all Taxes of or attributable to the Company or
any  of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or prior to the 
Closing Date and for the pre-Closing portion of any taxable period that 
includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD")  and
all Taxes attributable to any inclusion under Section 951 of the  Code by the
Buyer or its Affiliates at the end of the taxable year of a  Subsidiary of
the Company that includes the Closing Date arising out of  any income accrued
by such Subsidiary on or before the Closing Date.  With respect to any
Straddle Period, (i) Taxes, other than those  referred to in clause (ii)
below, attributable to the pre-Closing  portion shall be determined by means
of a closing of the books and  records of the Company as of the close of
business on the Closing Date,  provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated  on an annual basis (including depreciation
and amortization deductions)  shall be allocated between the period ending on
the Closing Date and    75   the period after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days  in such period, and (ii) property Taxes and
ad valorem Taxes  attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated
between the period  ending on the Closing Date and the period after the
Closing Date in  proportion to the number of days in each such period;
and   (vi) any and all notices, actions, suits, proceedings, claims, 
demands, assessments, judgments, costs, penalties and expenses,  including
reasonable attorneys\' and other professionals\' fees and  disbursements
(collectively, "INDEMNIFIABLE EXPENSES") incident to any  and all Losses with
respect to which indemnification is provided  hereunder.   (b) Subject to
Section 11.4, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Members that held
issued and outstanding Membership Interests as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") harmless from
and against:   (i) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or 
resulting from the failure of any representation or warranty of Buyer  set
forth in this Agreement, to be true and correct at the date hereof  and at
the Closing Date (except where the Buyer\'s representations and  warranties
are given as of any other applicable date, in which case  such representation
and warranty shall be correct as of such date);   (ii) any and all Losses
based upon, attributable to or  resulting from the breach of any covenant or
other agreement on the  part of Buyer under this Agreement; and   (iii) any
and all Indemnifiable Expenses incident to any and  all Losses with respect
to which indemnification is provided hereunder.   (c) The right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on
the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will
not affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.   11.3
Indemnification Procedures.   (a) The rights of the Company as the
indemnifying party under this Section 11.3 shall be exercised by the
Sellers\' Representative. In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be
instituted or that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person in
respect of which payment may be sought under Section 11.2 hereof (regardless
of the limitations set forth in Section 11.4) (an "INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM"),
the indemnified party shall reasonably and promptly (and in any event within
twenty (20) Business Days or sooner, if the    76  nature of the
Indemnification Claim so requires) cause written notice of the assertion of
any Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party
shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of
its choice, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder; provided that the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in
writing to the indemnified party its obligation to assume the defense of
any Indemnification Claim as provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party
elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder, it shall within twenty (20) Business Days (or sooner, if the
nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party
of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim
which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify
the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or fails to
acknowledge in writing its obligation to assume the defense of any
Indemnification Claim as herein provided, the indemnified party may defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim.
If the indemnified party defends any Indemnification Claim as provided in
this Section 11.3(a), then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the
indemnified party for the Indemnifiable Expenses of defending
such Indemnification Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the
indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the
indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense
of such Indemnification Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party
shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at
the expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnified parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.3 to the contrary, neither the
indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and
such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the
indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying party\'s willingness
to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations
of Section 11.4, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the indemnified
party declines to accept such offer, the indemnified party may continue to
contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the
indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to
such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party has an obligation to
pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the
settlement offer that the    77  indemnified party declined to accept
plus the Losses of the indemnified party relating to such Indemnification
Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the
aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to such
Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party
to any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with
respect to such Indemnification Claim.   (b) After any final judgment or
award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or
a settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with
respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall
forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the
indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and
the indemnifying party shall be required to pay all of the sums so due and
owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such notice.   (c) The
failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any
Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying party\'s obligations with respect thereto except to the extent
that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a
result of such failure.   11.4 Limitations on Indemnification.   (a) An
indemnifying party shall not have any liability under Section 11.2(a)(i),
Section 11.2(a)(iii) (other than in respect of income or franchise Taxes) or
Section 11.2(b)(i) hereof unless and until the aggregate amount of Taxes,
Losses and Indemnifiable Expenses to the indemnified parties determined to
arise thereunder which, in the case of any liability under Section 11.2(a)(i)
or Section 11.2(b)(i), are based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct (unless such
failure is the result of the indemnifying party\'s fraud or
willful misconduct), other than the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 4.1, 4.2(a), 4.3, 4.4, 4.21 and 5.1, 5.2(a), 5.3, 5.4 and 5.11
hereof and the representations and warranties related to income and franchise
Taxes set forth in Section 4.18 hereof, exceeds $2,900,000 (the "BASKET"), in
which case, only the Taxes, Losses and Indemnifiable Expenses in excess of
such amount of Tax, Loss and Indemnifiable Expenses shall be covered.   (b)
The Company shall not be required to indemnify any Person for an aggregate
amount of Taxes, Losses and Indemnifiable Expenses above the amount contained
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and Buyer shall not be required to indemnify
any Person for an aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Expenses and Losses above
an amount equal to $37,700,000.    78   (c) For purposes of calculating
Losses hereunder (but not for purposes of determining whether a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has occurred), any
materiality or material adverse effect qualifications in the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall be ignored.   (d) To the extent
that an indemnified party has recovered all or any portion of its Losses with
respect to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement, such
indemnified party shall not be entitled to recover such portion of such
Losses pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.   (e) The Company
shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any Taxes or any Losses or
Indemnifiable Expenses related to Taxes in each case to the extent such Taxes
are Company Expenses or are provided for on the audited consolidated balance
sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 or were
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Most Recent Balance
Sheet Date.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Buyer shall not have any liability under Section
11.(b)(i) hereof for any Losses and Indemnifiable Losses determined to arise
thereunder based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of any
representation or warranty of the Buyer contained in Article V to be true and
correct to the extent that the failure of any such representation or warranty
to be true and correct arose from DCM\'s bad faith, willful misconduct, gross
negligence or reckless disregard of its duties under the Management Agreement
prior to the Closing Date.   11.5 Indemnity Escrow. Any payment the Company
is obligated to make to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 11.2
shall be paid solely from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. Upon termination of the Survival Period, the Escrow Agent
shall release all of (i) the then existing amount of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund to each Member that held issued and outstanding Membership Interests as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with such Member\'s
Fully Diluted Percentage Interests, less (ii) the amount of claims for
indemnification under Section 11.2 asserted by the Buyer prior to the
termination of the Survival Period but not yet resolved ("UNRESOLVED
CLAIMS"), and any unreleased amount shall be retained by the Escrow Agent.
The Indemnity Escrow Fund retained for Unresolved Claims shall be released by
the Escrow Agent (to the extent not utilized to pay Buyer for any such claims
resolved in favor of Buyer) to each Member that held issued and outstanding
Membership Interests as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with such Member\'s Fully Diluted Percentage Interests upon their
resolution in accordance with Sections 11.1 through 11.8.    79   11.6
Tax Matters. The parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant
to this Article XI as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for
all income Tax purposes unless otherwise required by a change in applicable
Tax Laws or a good faith resolution of a Tax contest.   11.7 Non-Recourse.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Representative
or Affiliate of either party shall have any personal liability to the other
party or any other Person as a result of the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such first party in this
Agreement.   11.8 Exclusivity of Indemnity. The indemnification provided
in Section 11.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date
for damages available to the parties to this Agreement for breach of any of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
any right, claim or action arising from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than for fraud. The Buyer Indemnified Parties expressly
waive, release and agree not to make any claim against the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, except for indemnification claims made pursuant to Section 11.2, for
the recovery of any costs or damages, whether directly or by way of
contribution, or for any other relief whatsoever, under any applicable Laws,
whether now existing or applicable or hereinafter enacted or applicable
(including claims for breach of contract, failure of disclosure, tortious
wrongdoing or violation of environmental or other securities Laws).   11.9
Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial.   (a)
Any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be instituted in any Federal court in the State of
New York, and each party agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense
or otherwise, in any such claim, that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court, that the claim is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the claim is improper or that this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
court. Each party further irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such
court in any such claim.   (b) Any and all service of process and any other
notice in any such claim shall be effective against any party if given
personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or
by any other means of mail that requires a signed receipt, postage prepaid,
mailed to such party as herein provided. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner
permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any other party in any other jurisdiction.   (c) EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND    80  UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY.   (d) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE WAIVER IN SECTION
11.9(C), (II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS, AGREEMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN SECTION 11.9(C) AND THIS
SECTION 11.9(D).   11.10 Notices. Any notice or other communication required

thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.  
11.13 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in

or unenforceable, the remaining portion of such provision and the
