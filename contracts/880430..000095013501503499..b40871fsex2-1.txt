and the Purchaser. Such time and date are herein referred to as the "CLOSING
DATE."   Section 1.5 TRANSFER TAXES. The Sellers, on the one hand, and
the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each pay and be responsible for 50%
of all stamp, transfer, documentary, sales, use, value added, registration,

any penalties and interest), if any, incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the
"TRANSFER TAXES").   Section 1.6 DELIVERIES BY THE SELLERS. At the Closing,
the Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser:   (a) certificates representing
the number of shares of Stock set opposite such Seller\'s name on ANNEX A

pledges, charges, encumbrances, restrictions and claims of every kind
and character ("ENCUMBRANCES"). There are no existing (a) options, warrants,
calls, pre-emptive rights, subscriptions or other rights, convertible

agreements to which such Seller is a party with respect to CPIC, LTSI, SMI or

all Encumbrances other than any Encumbrances arising from the acts or
omissions of the Purchaser. Such Seller does not own or have the right to
acquire any securities issued by CPIC, LTSI, SMI or any Subsidiary thereof
that are not listed on ANNEX A.   Section 2.2 AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY OF
AGREEMENT.   (a) Such Seller is a natural person or a legal entity of
the type set forth opposite such Seller\'s name in ANNEX A. Such Seller who
is a natural person is competent and has all requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Such Seller which is not a natural person has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of
its jurisdiction of formation, has all requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions

authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.   (b)
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such
Seller and, assuming the due execution of this Agreement by the Purchaser and
each of the other Sellers, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms, except
to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership and similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and to general
equitable principles.   Section 2.3 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS: NO VIOLATIONS.
Assuming that filings required, if any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR ACT") or any foreign
antitrust, competition or investment laws and regulations, are made and the
waiting period thereunder has been terminated or has expired, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by such Seller and the consummation by such
Seller of the Sale and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(a) will not violate any statute, rule, regulation, order or decree of any
foreign, federal, state or local governmental or regulatory body, agency or
authority ("GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY") by which such Seller is bound or by
which any of its respective properties or assets are bound, (b) will not
require any permit, consent or approval of, or the giving of any notice to,
or filing with, any individual, partnership, joint venture, corporation,
limited liability company, trust, unincorporated organization, Governmental
Authority or any other person (a "PERSON"), and (c) will not result in a
violation or breach of, conflict with, constitute (with or without due notice
or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, loss of rights or benefits, payment
or acceleration) under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any
of the properties or assets of such Seller under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license,
franchise, permit, agreement,    3   lease, franchise agreement or any
other instrument or obligation to which such Seller is a party, or by which
it or any of its respective properties or assets may be bound, excluding from
the foregoing clauses filings, permits, consents, approvals and notices the
absence of which, and violations, breaches, defaults, conflicts and
Encumbrances, the existence of which, in the aggregate, will not prevent or
materially delay such Seller from performing its obligations hereunder or
have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 2.4 BROKER\'S OR FINDER\'S FEES.
No agent, broker, firm or other Person acting on behalf of such Seller or any
of the Companies is, or will be, entitled to any investment banking
commission, broker\'s or finder\'s fees from any of the parties hereto, or
from any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any
of the parties hereto, in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for Robert W. Baird and Co.
Incorporated, whose fees and expenses will be paid by CPIC prior to
the Closing.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS OF THE SELLERS RELATING TO
THE COMPANIES   Each Seller hereby severally represents and warrants to the
Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing (or, if made
as of a specified date, as of such date) as set forth below. The
exceptions, modifications, descriptions and disclosures in any Schedule
attached hereto are made for all relevant purposes of this Agreement and are
exceptions by the Sellers to all representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement; PROVIDED, THAT, there are no exceptions, modifications,
descriptions or disclosures to Section 3.5 and the only exceptions,
modifications, descriptions or disclosures to Sections 3.7 and 3.13 are those
set forth in Schedule 3.7 and 3.13, respectively.   Section 3.1 EXISTENCE
AND GOOD STANDING. CPIC, LTSI and SMI are corporations duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Illinois, Ontario and
California, respectively, and have all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate their properties and assets and to carry
on their business as currently being conducted. CPIC, LTSI and SMI are duly
qualified or licensed as foreign corporations to conduct their business as is
currently being conducted and, to the extent applicable, are in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property and
assets owned, leased or operated by them or the nature of the business
conducted by them makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"
means any change, effect, event or occurrence that is materially adverse to,
or has a materially adverse effect on, the business, assets, liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), condition (whether financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of CPIC, LTSI, SMI and their
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than any change, effect, event or
occurrence (a) relating to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of CPIC, LTSI, SMI or any of their Subsidiaries that has been
disclosed in SCHEDULE 3.1, (b) resulting from general economic, financial,
regulatory or market conditions, (c) resulting from conditions or
circumstances generally affecting the industry in which the Companies
operate, or (d) resulting from the announcement of the Sale or the other
transactions contemplated herein or in any other agreement or
document executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Each of CPIC,
LTSI, and SMI has heretofore delivered to the Purchaser complete and correct
copies of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws as presently in
effect.   Section 3.2 CAPITAL STOCK. SCHEDULE 3.2 sets forth the
authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of CPIC, LTSI, SMI and each
of their Subsidiaries. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
CPIC, LTSI, SMI and their Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. There are no existing (a)
options, warrants, calls, pre-emptive rights, subscriptions or other rights,
convertible securities, agreements or commitments of any character obligating
CPIC, LTSI, SMI or any of their Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell, or
cause to be issued, transferred or sold, any shares of capital stock or other
equity interest in CPIC, LTSI, SMI or any such Subsidiary or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests except
as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.2(a); (b) rights or obligations of CPIC, LTSI, SMI
or any of their Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
capital stock of CPIC, LTSI,    4   SMI or any such Subsidiary, or to
provide funds to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in any Subsidiary or any other Person except as
set forth in SCHEDULE 3.2(b); or (c) voting trusts, stockholders\' agreements
or similar agreements to which CPIC, LTSI, SMI or any of their Subsidiaries
are a party with respect to CPIC, LTSI, SMI or any such Subsidiary except as
set forth in SCHEDULE 3.2(c).   Section 3.3 SUBSIDIARIES. SCHEDULE 3.3(a)
sets forth all of the Subsidiaries of CPIC, LTSI and SMI, their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation, the authorized and outstanding capital of
each Subsidiary and the jurisdictions in which each such Subsidiary is
qualified to do business. Each Subsidiary of CPIC, LTSI and SMI is wholly
owned, directly or indirectly, by CPIC, LTSI or SMI, except as set forth in
SCHEDULE 3.3(b). None of the Subsidiary shares identified in SCHEDULE 3.3(b)
are being sold to the Purchaser in the Sale or otherwise hereunder. No
Company owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity
securities of any corporation other than a Subsidiary or has any direct or
indirect equity or ownership interest in any business other than a
Subsidiary. All of the outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary owned
directly or indirectly by CPIC, LTSI or SMI is free and clear of all
Encumbrances, and is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Each such
Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its state or province of incorporation; (b)
has full corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted and to own the properties and assets it now owns; and (c) is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction listed opposite the name of such Subsidiary
in SCHEDULE 3.3(a) which are the only jurisdictions in which the properties
owned or leased or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary. Each such Subsidiary has heretofore delivered to the
Purchaser complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws thereof, as presently in effect. As used in this Agreement, the word
"SUBSIDIARY"means, with respect to any Person, any other Person, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i) such Person or any other
Subsidiary of such Person is a general partner (excluding such partnerships
where such Person or any Subsidiary of such Person does not have a majority
of the voting interest in such partnership) or (ii) at least a majority of
the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such Person is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such Person or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by
such Person and one or more of its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.4 CONSENTS AND
APPROVALS; NO VIOLATION. Assuming that filings required under the HSR Act or
any foreign antitrust, competition or investment laws and regulations are
made and the waiting period thereunder has been terminated or has expired,

claims, costs, interest, penalties and fees of legal counsel, asserted
against, imposed upon or incurred by the Sellers or any Company arising from

the other of the occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction of
the conditions in Articles VII or VIII impossible or unlikely. Without

Closing Date; PROVIDED, THAT, (i) the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.10 shall survive until 60 days
following the expiration of the statute of limitations period applicable to
the matters covered thereby (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension there) if later, (ii) the representations and warranties as to
title to the Stock in Sections 2.1 and 3.3 shall survive indefinitely, (iii)
the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.15 shall survive
until four years after the Closing Date and (iv) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.12 shall survive until three years after
the Closing Date; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that any claims of a breach of
any surviving representation or warranty made in good faith prior to the
applicable expiration date therefore shall survive such date to the extent of
the facts alleged in such claim and any other claim related to such claim or
the facts underlying such claim prior to such expiration date. The covenants
and agreements contained herein to be performed or complied with after the
Closing shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.     31    Section 9.2 INDEMNITIES.   (a) From and after the
Closing, each of JCP and JJC hereby agrees, severally to the extent of his
Proportionate Indemnity Interest, and not jointly, to indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser and, without duplication each Company, from and
against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses)
(collectively, "DAMAGES") suffered or paid by the Purchaser or any Company as
a result of the breach by any Seller of (i) any representation or warranty
made by any Seller in this Agreement and (ii) any covenant, undertaking or
other agreement of any Seller contained in this Agreement.
"PROPORTIONATE INDEMNITY INTEREST," as used herein, shall mean 50% with
respect to JCP and 50% with respect to JJC.   (b) From and after the
Closing, the Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers against Damages suffered or paid by each and, without duplication,
all of them as a result of the breach by the Purchaser of (i) any
representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in this Agreement and (ii)
any covenant, undertaking or other agreement of the Purchaser contained in
this Agreement.   (c) Any party seeking indemnification under this Article
IX (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give each party from whom indemnification
is being sought (each, an "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") notice of any matter for
which such Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification, stating the amount
of the Damages, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises. The obligations of an Indemnifying
Party under this Article IX with respect to Damages arising from any claims
of any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in
this Article IX (collectively, "THIRD PARTY CLAIMS") shall be governed by the
following additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall
receive, after the Closing Date, initial notice of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third
Party Claim within such time frame as necessary to allow for a timely
response and in any event within 30 days of the receipt by the Indemnified
Party of such notice; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to provide such
timely notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article IX except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention
to do so to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt of such
notice from the Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if there exists a
conflict of interest (including, without limitation, the availability of one
or more legal defenses to the Indemnified Party which are not available to
the Indemnifying Party) that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable
judgment of the Indemnified Party (upon and in conformity with advice of
counsel) for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
retain one counsel (plus appropriate local counsel), at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, provided that the Indemnified Party and such counsel
shall contest such Third Party Claims in good faith. In the event the
Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against
any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party\'s
possession or under the Indemnified Party\'s control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against
any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified
Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all such witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Indemnifying Party\'s possession or under
the Indemnifying Party\'s control relating thereto as is reasonably required
by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), (i) settle    32   or compromise any Third Party
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to
Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim or (ii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim in any
manner that may adversely affect the Indemnified Party. Finally, no Third
Party Claim which is being defended in good faith by the Indemnifying Party
or which is being defended by the Indemnified Party as provided above in this
Section 9.2(c) shall be settled by the Indemnified Party without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   Section 9.3 LIMITS ON INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) No amount shall be
recoverable by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.2(a) unless the aggregate
amount of Damages (other than those relating to representations and
warranties in Section 3.10 in respect of which no "basket" shall apply) so
recoverable exceeds $2,000,000, and in such case each of JCP and JJC shall be
required to pay his Proportionate Indemnity Interest of all of the Damages in
excess of $1,000,000.   (b) No amount shall be recoverable by the Sellers
pursuant to Section 9.2(b) unless the aggregate amount of Damages (other than
those relating to the covenants in Section 5.12 in respect of which no
"basket" shall apply) so recoverable exceeds $2,000,000, and in such case the
Purchaser shall be required to pay all of the Damages in excess of
$1,000,000.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement but subject to Section 6.8, the maximum amount of
indemnifiable Damages which may be recovered by the Purchaser arising out of
or resulting from the causes enumerated in Section 9.2(a) shall be an amount
equal to $22,500,000 from JCP and $22,500,000 from JJC.   (d)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject to Section 6.8, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Damages which may
be recovered by the Sellers arising out of or resulting from the causes
enumerated in Section 9.2(b) shall be an amount equal to $45,000,000.   (e)
In case any event shall occur which would otherwise entitle either party to
assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, no Damage shall be deemed to
have been sustained by such party to the extent of any proceeds received
or to be received by such party from any insurance policies with respect
thereto. The indemnification provided for in Article VI and in this Article
IX shall constitute the sole remedy of any party to the Agreement with
respect to (i) breaches by any other party to the Agreement of any of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in the
Agreement, (ii) any events, circumstances or conditions which are the subject
of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the
Agreement, (iii) any other matters related to the Sale or the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, and (iv) any other events, circumstances or
conditions relating to the ownership or operation of any Company prior to the
Closing.  (f) If the Damages suffered or paid by a party pursuant to Section
9.2 (an "INDEMNITY CLAIM") results in an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
then the indemnity payment shall equal the full amount of the Indemnity
Claim. If the Indemnity Claim does not result in an adjustment to the
Purchase Price and gives rise to a currently realizable Tax Benefit to the
party making the claim, the indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount
of the Tax Benefit available to the party making the claim. To the extent
such Indemnity Claim does not give rise to a currently realizable Tax
Benefit, if the amount with respect to which any indemnity payment is made
gives rise to a subsequently realized Tax Benefit to the party that made the
claim, such party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such
Tax     33   Benefit when, as and if realized. For the purposes of this
Agreement, any subsequently realized Tax Benefit shall be treated as though
it were a reduction in the amount of the initial indemnity payment, and the
liabilities of the parties shall be redetermined as though both occurred at
or prior to the time of the indemnity payment. For purposes of this Section
9.3(f), a "TAX BENEFIT" means an amount by which the net Tax liability of the
party (or Persons including or related to the party) is reduced (including,
without limitation, by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased
Tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any
related interest received from the relevant taxing authority (net of any
Taxes payable as a result of the receipt thereof) and taking into account the
net present value (as determined below) of any net increase in the party\'s
liability for Taxes which is attributable to the loss of deductions,
amortizations, exclusions from income or other allowances resulting from any
adjustments to the Purchase Price (which gives rise to any adjustments to the
tax basis of any Company asset or assets) by reason of the party\'s receipt
of the indemnity payment. The net present value of any net increase in the
party\'s liability for Taxes shall be calculated by (x) using the maximum
marginal federal, state, local and foreign Tax rates applicable to the party
for 2001, (y) using a discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable federal
rate in effect on the Closing Date (compounded semi-annually) and (z)
assuming that all deductions, amortizations, exclusions from income or other
allowances would be utilized at the earliest date or dates allowable by
applicable law. Where a party has other losses, deductions, credits or items
available to it, the Tax Benefit from any losses, deductions, credits or
items relating to the Indemnity Claim shall be deemed to be utilized
last relative to any other losses, deductions, credits or items. For purposes
of this Section 9.3(f), a Tax Benefit is "currently realizable" to the extent
it can be reasonably anticipated that such Tax Benefit will be realized in
the current taxable period or year or in any Tax Return with respect thereto
(including through a carryback to a prior taxable period) or in any taxable
period or year prior to the date of the Indemnity Claim. In the event that
there should be a determination disallowing the Tax Benefit, the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable to refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any
related reduction previously allowed or payments previously made to the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.3(f). The amount of the
refunded reduction or payment shall be deemed a payment under Section
9.2.   (g) Except as provided in Section 9.3(f), an Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable under this Article IX for consequential damages, special
damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, lost profits or similar items;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this Section 9.3(g) shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of obligations to pay consequential damages, special
damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, lost profits or similar items
required to be paid for the benefit of a third party pursuant to a Third
Party Claim.   (h) To the extent that the Indemnifying Party discharges any
claim for indemnification hereunder, they shall be subrogated to all related
rights of the Indemnified Party against third parties.   (i) Each
Indemnified Party shall be obligated in connection with any claim for
indemnification under Section 9.2 to use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such Damages.   ARTICLE X  
TERMINATION   Section 10.1 TERMINATION. Anything herein or elsewhere to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing Date:   (a) by the mutual consent of the Sellers and the
Purchaser;     34    (b) by either the Sellers or the Purchaser:  
(i) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to January 31, 2002;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of,
or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;
or   (ii) if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree
or ruling or taken any other action (which order, decree, ruling or
other action the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to lift), in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  
(c) by the Sellers if the Purchaser (x) breaches or fails in any material
respect to perform or comply with any of its material covenants
and agreements contained herein or (y) breaches its representations and
warranties in any material respect in each case such that the conditions set
forth in Article VIII would not be satisfied; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any
such breach is curable by the Purchaser through the exercise of its
reasonable best efforts and for so long as the Purchaser shall be so using
its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, the Sellers may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c); or   (d) by the
Purchaser if the Sellers (x) breach or fail in any material respect to
perform or comply with any of their material covenants and
agreements contained herein or (y) breach their representations and
warranties in any material respect in each case such that the conditions set
forth in Article VII would not be satisfied; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any
such breach is curable by the Sellers through the exercise of the Sellers\'
reasonable best efforts and for so long as the Sellers\' shall be so using
their reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, the Purchaser may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d).   Section 10.2

pursuant to Section 10.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the other
parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and all further obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement
(other than pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5.2, this Section 10.2
and Sections 11.1,11.2, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8, 11.10, 11.l3 and 11.14, all
of which shall continue in full force and effect) shall terminate without
further liability or obligation of either party to the other party hereunder;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no party shall be released from liability hereunder
if this Agreement is terminated by reason of any willful breach of this
Agreement by such party.   ARTICLE XI   MISCELLANEOUS  -------------
