AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 22,
2004 by and among The Wine Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the " _LLC_ "), The Wine Group, Inc., a California corporation (" _Manager_
" and, collectively with LLC, "Parent"), Hawk Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the LLC (" _Purchaser_ ") and
Golden State Vintners, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").
Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in Section 8.03.

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser, the Company and the
Manager have approved, and each deems it advisable and in the best interests
of its stockholders to consummate, the acquisition of the Company by
Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Transactions (as defined
in Section 3.01(d)) and also to prescribe various conditions to
the Transactions;

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  



  

THE MERGER

  



  

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), the Company and Purchaser shall consummate
a merger (the " _Merger_ ") pursuant to which (a) Purchaser shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Purchaser
shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company shall be the successor or surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware, and (c) the separate corporate existence of the
Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in this Section
1.01. Pursuant to the Merger, (x) the Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), shall be amended at the Effective
Time such that its terms are identical to the certificate of incorporation of
Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the Surviving
Corporation shall be named Golden State Vintners, Inc.) and shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation Certificate_ ") until thereafter amended as provided by law and
such certificate of incorporation, and (y) the bylaws of Purchaser, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, by such
certificate of incorporation or by such bylaws. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in the DGCL.

  

      
   



  

Section 1.02 _Closing_.  The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties (the
" _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second business day
after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article
VI (other than conditions with respect to actions the parties will take at
the Closing itself), unless another time or date is agreed to by the
parties hereto. The Closing will be held at the offices of Farella Braun \+
Martel LLP, 235 Montgomery Street, San Francisco, California 94104, or at
such other location as is agreed to by the parties.

  



  

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in a form reasonably
acceptable to the parties hereto and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other subsequent date
or time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, such time being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

  



  

Section 1.04 _Directors and Officers_.  The directors and officers of
Purchaser at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed or qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  



  

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders of
any (i) issued and outstanding shares (the " _Shares_ ") of (A) Class A
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Class A
Common Stock_") or (B) Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the " _Class B Common Stock_" and, together with the Class A
Common Stock, the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or (ii) common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "):

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Purchaser_.  Each issued and outstanding share of (i)
Purchaser Common Stock shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and (ii) Purchaser Preferred Stock shall be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of preferred
stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the same rights, preferences and
other terms as the Purchaser Preferred Stock.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_.  Each Share held in the Companys
treasury or by any of the Companys subsidiaries, Parent or any of Parents

  



  

2      
   



  

subsidiaries shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.  Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.01(b) and other than any Dissenting Shares (as
hereinafter defined)) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
equal to Eight Dollars and Twenty Five Cents ($8.25) in cash, payable to the
holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon
surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Share in the manner
provided in Section 2.02. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration therefor, without interest, upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02 (or,
if applicable, to be treated as a Dissenting Share).

  



  

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates, Exchange Agent_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to act as agent for the holders of the Shares in connection with
the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to receive in trust the funds to which
holders of the Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c).
At the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Shares
the aggregate consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.01(c). Such funds shall be invested
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pending payment thereof by
the Exchange Agent to holders of the Shares (it being understood that any and
all interest earned on funds made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
this Agreement shall be the property of, and shall be turned over to,
Parent).

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), whose
Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.01 into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions not
inconsistent with this Agreement as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and the
signatures thereon properly guaranteed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid

  



  

3      
   



  

any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.  Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section
2.02. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II. Any amounts unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, as hereinafter
defined) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_.  At any time following nine months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any earnings
or interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to
the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws) and only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates,
without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, in the event any Certificates will have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such sum as
Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate(s),
the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.02(b) deliverable in respect of the Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates.

  



  

(f) _Withholding Taxes_.  Parent and Purchaser will be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger
Consideration payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger any such
amounts as are required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any applicable

  



  

4      
   



  

provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent or Purchaser, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent
or Purchaser.

  



  

Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Shares as to which the holder thereof has demanded appraisal with respect to
the Merger in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and as of the Effective
Time has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his right to such appraisal
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, but the
holder thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the
DGCL.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.03(a), if any holder of
Shares who demands appraisal of his Shares under the DGCL effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders
right to appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever later occurs, such holders Shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest, upon
surrender of the Certificate or Certificates representing such
Shares pursuant to Section 2.02.

  



  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to the DGCL
and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as may be required
under applicable law, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any such
demands.

  



  

Section 2.04 _Company Stock Option Plans_.

  



  

(a) Parent and the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that
all outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any stock option or stock purchase
plan, program or agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
a party which is outstanding immediately prior to Effective Time, whether or
not then exercisable, shall, except as set forth below, be canceled as of the
Effective Time and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount
in cash payable at the time of cancellation of such Company Stock Option
equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration _over_ (B) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option; _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option. Such cash payment shall be subject to
any required tax withholding.

  



  

(b) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of the Company
Stock Option Plans (as defined in Section 3.01(c)) or pursuant to the terms
of any Company Stock Option granted thereunder, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its

  



  

5      
   



  

reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain the consent of each holder of
outstanding Company Stock Options to the foregoing treatment of such Company
Stock Options and (ii) ensure that none of Purchaser, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation is or will be bound by any Company Stock Option Plan,
any Company Stock Option or any other option, warrant, right or agreement
which would entitle any person, other than Parent or its Affiliates, to own
any capital stock of the Company, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or
to receive any payment in respect thereof.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either Purchaser or the Company acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in

good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company
and the Company Subsidiary with all amendments and restatements through the
date hereof.

Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the qualification, however, that enforcement of the rights and
remedies created hereby is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company does
not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of
any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary under, (i) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company or the Company Subsidiary, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other contract, instrument, permit, or

assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such
conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. No
consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by, or in respect of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state, local or

governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental U.S. or
foreign self-regulatory agency, commission or authority or any arbitral

the Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions, except for: (1) the filing with the Securities and Exchange

Agreement and the Transactions; (2) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
(including the Surviving Corporation Certificate) with the Secretary of State

(e) _Reports; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(i) The Company has timely filed or furnished, as applicable, all required
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits
and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed or
furnished with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (collectively, the " _Company
SEC Documents_ "), and has previously made available or delivered to Parent
true and complete copies of all Company SEC Documents, including all exhibits
thereto.  As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC
Documents when filed (as supplemented or amended by subsequently filed
Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof) contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents comply as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as

  



  

9      
   



  

permitted by Form 10  Q of the SEC) in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal recurring year-end audit adjustments). Except (A) as reflected in
such financial statements or in the notes thereto, (B) for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or (C) for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the respective
dates of such financial statements, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liabilities required by GAAP to be reflected on
a balance sheet which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(ii) Since January 1, 2001, the Company and the Company Subsidiary have not
created or effected any securitization transactions or "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K of Title 17, Part
229 of the Code of Federal Regulations (" _Regulation S-K_ ").  The
statements of operations included in the financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents do not contain any items of special or
nonrecurring revenue or any other income not earned in the ordinary course of
business except as expressly specified therein. Except for normal or recurring
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business of the Company
consistent with past practice, neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiary
has incurred any liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, contingent or
otherwise, which would constitute a Material Adverse Effect.  The Company is
in compliance with all applicable corporate governance requirements of the
Nasdaq and all applicable requirements of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(f) _Information Supplied_.  The Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.01)
will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders and at the
time of the Company Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.01), not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to information that Parent or Purchaser supplied to it
expressly for inclusion therein or for incorporation by reference therein.
The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

  



  

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.  Except for liabilities incurred
in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, since December 31,
2003, each of the Company and the Company Subsidiary has conducted its
business only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice, and there has not been (i) any Material Adverse Change, (ii) any
declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution
(whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any of the Companys or
the Company Subsidiarys capital stock, (iii) any split, combination or
reclassification of any of the

  



  

10      
   



  

Company or the Company Subsidiarys capital stock or any issuance or the
authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu
of or in substitution for shares of the Company or the Company Subsidiarys
capital stock, except for issuances of Company Common Stock under the Company
Stock Option Plans, (iv) (A) any granting by the Company or the Company
Subsidiary to any director, officer or employee of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary of any increase in compensation, bonus or other benefits, except
for normal increases in the ordinary course of business or in connection with
the hiring or promotion of any such director, officer or employee or
increases required under any written employment agreements in effect as of
the date of the most recent audited financial statements included in the
Company SEC Documents, (B) any granting by the Company or the Company
Subsidiary to any director, officer or employee of any severance or
termination pay or any increase in severance or termination pay, except in
connection with the hiring of any such officer, or (C) any entry by the
Company or the Company Subsidiary into, or any amendment of, any employment,
deferred compensation, consulting, severance, termination or indemnification
agreement with any director, officer, or employee, except in connection with
the hiring of any such director or officer, (v) except insofar as may be
required by a change in GAAP, any change in accounting methods, principles or
practices by the Company or the Company Subsidiary materially affecting its
assets, liabilities or business, (vi) any tax election that would have a
Material Adverse Effect or materially affect any of the Companys or the
Company Subsidiarys tax attributes or any settlement or compromise of any
material income tax liability of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, (vii)
any sale, exchange, transfer, disposition or grant of any Lien on any real
property of the Company or the Company Subsidiary in an amount exceeding
$250,000; (viii) any event or change that had a Material Adverse Effect or
constituted a Material Adverse Change, (ix) any action that would have been
prohibited by Section 4.01 had it been in effect or (x) any agreement to do
any of the foregoing.

  



  

(h) _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Litigation_. Each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiary holds all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
orders, registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities that are
required for the operation of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiary as currently conducted by each of them (collectively, the "
_Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any such Company
Permits would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiary is in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits and
all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, except
where the failure so to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
 The Company has not received written notice of any violation of
any applicable law or that any Company Permit will be terminated or modified
or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business. No action, demand,
requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and no suit, action
or proceeding by any person, in each case with respect to the Company or the
Company Subsidiary or any of the Company or the Company Subsidiarys
properties is pending or, to the knowledge (as defined in Section 8.03) of
the Company or the Company Subsidiary, overtly threatened against the Company
or the Company Subsidiary, other than, in each case, those the outcome of
which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(i) _Benefit Plans_.   _Section 3.01(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
contains a true and complete list of all written employee benefit plans,
programs, policies, agreements, all deferred compensation plans, programs or
arrangements, all stock

maintained, sponsored, contributed to or required to be contributed to during
the three-year period ending on the date of this Agreement by the Company or

director of the Company or the Company Subsidiary or any former Subsidiary of
the Company or other person formerly controlled by the Company (collectively,
the " _Company Benefit Plans_ ").

  



  

(j) _ERISA Compliance_.

  



  

(i) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan: (A) each such Company Benefit
Plan currently in effect is legally valid and binding, benefits under such
plan are as represented in the documents evidencing such Company
Benefit Plan, the Company and the Company Subsidiary have no announced plan
or commitment to modify or amend any such Company Benefit Plan, except
for required amendments described in clause (B) below, or to increase
benefits payable thereunder and, except for Company Benefit Plans listed on
the Company Disclosure Schedule as having been terminated, each such Company
Benefit Plan has been maintained in full force and effect; (B) if intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, (1) Section
3.01(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule so identifies each such Company
Benefit Plan, (2) such Company Benefit Plan so qualifies in both form and
operation, and (3) its trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code; (C) such Company Benefit Plan has been administered and enforced in
substantial compliance with the applicable provisions of the Code and ERISA
and the terms of such Company Benefit Plan and any related collective
bargaining agreement; (D) there are no actions, suits or claims pending
against such Company Benefit Plan or affecting any fiduciary thereof other
than claims for benefits made in the ordinary course; (E) there are presently
no outstanding judgments, decrees or orders of any court or
other Governmental Entity against or affecting the Company Benefit Plans,
any fiduciaries thereof or the assets of any trust or insurance
contract thereunder, (F) no reportable event (within the meaning of Section
4043(b) of ERISA and the regulations thereunder) has occurred during the
five-year period ending on the date of this Agreement (G) all material
reports and disclosures relating to the Company Benefit Plans required to be
filed with or furnished to Governmental Entities, participants
or beneficiaries on or prior to the Effective Time have been or will be filed
or furnished in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable law, (H)
all required contributions have been made on a timely basis; (I) all
contributions made or required to be made under such Company Benefit Plan and
intended to be deductible under the Code meet the requirements for
deductibility under the Code; (J) with respect to each Company Benefit Plan
subject to either Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA (1) Section
3.01(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each such Company

under ERISA and the actuarial assumptions used in connection

  



  

12      
   



  

therewith are reasonable, (3) such Company Benefit Plan has not incurred
an accumulated funding deficiency during the five-year period ending on the
date of this Agreement, whether or not waived, nor does any liability or
obligation exist with respect to any accumulated funding deficiency for any
time prior to such period and (4) the fair market value of the assets of such
Company Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the present value of all "benefit
liabilities" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA; and (K)
future compliance with the requirements of ERISA or the Code as in effect at
the Effective Time or with any collective bargaining agreements to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party at the Effective Time will
not result in any increase in the rate of benefit accrual or the liabilities
of the Company or any Subsidiary under the Company Benefit Plan (except as
such increase may result from changes in Applicable law). No event has
occurred in connection with which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could
reasonably be expected to be subject to any material liability under Section
406, 409, 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA, or Section 4975 of the Code, or under
any agreement or other instrument pursuant to which the Company or any

filing been made with the PBGC for the termination of any Company Benefit
Plan subject to the provisions of Title IV of ERISA in a manner that has
resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the PBGC. The PBGC has not taken
any action relating to the termination of or the appointment of a trustee to
administer any Company Benefit Plan nor do conditions currently exist which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a termination proceeding brought
by the PBGC with regard to any such Company Benefit Plan.

Company Benefit Plan that is a multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37)
or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "). In the case of each
Multiemployer Plan, the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the

Subsidiaries for the twelve months ended on the last day of the most recent
fiscal year of each such Multiemployer Plan. With respect to each

Multiemployer Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code and operation and has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service that such Multiemployer Plan is qualified under such
section, its related trust has been determined to be exempt from taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code and nothing has occurred since the date of
the most recent determination letter that has affected adversely or could
reasonably be expected to affect adversely such qualification or exemption;
(ii) each such Multiemployer Plan is in compliance in

  



  

13      
   



  

all material respects with its terms and all governing documents as well as
with the requirements prescribed by all applicable statutes, orders and

the Code; (iii) there are no actions or proceedings (other than routine
claims for benefits) pending, threatened or anticipated; and (iv) no such
Multiemployer Plan is under audit or investigation by either the IRS, U. S.
Department of Labor, PBGC or other Governmental Entity and no such completed
audit, if any, has resulted in the imposition of any Tax, fine or penalty.
 The Company Disclosure Schedule also identifies each Multiemployer Plan
that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Pension Plan_ ").
With respect to each Multiemployer Pension Plan: (i) none of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiary has received a notice that increased
contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in plan benefits or the
imposition of any excise tax or that any such plan is or may become
"insolvent" (within the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA); (ii) none of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiary has withdrawn therefrom in a
complete withdrawal (within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA) or a
partial withdrawal (within the meaning of Section 4205 of ERISA) or received
any notice of any claim or demand in respect thereof; and (iii) to the
knowledge of the Company, no withdrawal liability to any Multiemployer
Pension Plan has been or is expected to be incurred with respect to any

Company or any of the Company Subsidiary has transferred a defined benefit
plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) to a corporation that was (at the
time of transfer) a member of a different controlled group of corporations
(within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) than the transferor.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has ever sponsored,
maintained, contributed to, or had any obligation to contribute to, a single-
employer plan which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of
whom are not under common control.

  



  

(v) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan which is a "welfare plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA): (A) no such plan provides medical or death
benefits with respect to current or former employees of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary beyond their termination of employment (other
than coverage mandated by law); (B) there are no provisions, assets, surplus
or prepaid premiums under any such plan reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet included in the Company SEC Documents, except for
accrued vacation pay; and (C) to the knowledge of the Company, each such plan
has, to the extent applicable, been administered in substantial compliance
with Sections 601-609 of ERISA and Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

  



  

(vi) The consummation of the Transactions will not (A) entitle any individual
to severance pay, (B) increase the amount or accelerate the time of payment
or vesting of compensation due or of benefits payable under any Company
Benefit Plan with respect to any individual, (C) cause any amount to be
treated as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code

  



  

14      
   



  

or (D) result in any liability of the Company or the Company Subsidiary
under Title IV of ERISA or any multiemployer pension or welfare benefit plan.

  



  

(k) _Taxes_.

  



  

(i) The Company has made available or furnished to Parent all Tax Returns
filed by the Company with respect to it and the Company Subsidiary for all
periods ending on or after June 30, 2000 and before the date of this
Agreement, and supporting information, claims for refunds of Taxes and any
amendments, supplements, or other information supplied to the taxing
authorities for all such periods.  The Company and the Company Subsidiary
have timely filed all Tax Returns required by law to be filed by them prior
to the date of this Agreement and such Tax Returns are true, complete and
correct in all material respects. The Company has paid or made
adequate provision in the most recent consolidated balance sheet contained in
the Company SEC Documents in accordance with GAAP for the payment of all
Taxes which have accrued or have become payable with respect to the Company
and the Company Subsidiary. All Taxes that the Company and the Company
Subsidiary have been required to withhold or to collect have been duly
withheld or collected and all withholdings and collections either have been

have a tax treaty or convention that could subject the Company and/or the
Company Subsidiary to the tax laws of such non-U.S. country.

licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its

requisite limited liability company or corporate power and authority, as
applicable, to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and

transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser does
not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not, conflict with,

governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence,
any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any
such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) that would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by, or in respect of,

the filing of comparable pre-merger notifications in non-U.S. jurisdictions,
if applicable, and the expiration of any mandatory waiting

  



  

23      
   



  

periods thereunder; and (4) such consents, approvals, orders or
authorizations the failure of which to be made or obtained would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c) _Information Supplied_.  None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Purchaser specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

Executive Officer of the Company, or acting or purporting to act in any other

Section 4.02 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall, and it shall cause the Company Subsidiary and each
officer, employee, agent and representative (including without limitation any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by the Company or the Company Subsidiary) (each, a
"Representative") of the Company and the Company Subsidiary to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties conducted
heretofore (other than Parent and the Purchaser) with respect to any Takeover
Proposal (as defined below). The Company shall, and it shall require
the Company Subsidiary and the Representatives to, promptly after the
Company Stockholder Approval, require any party that previously received
any confidential information of the Company or the Company Subsidiary in
connection with any Takeover Proposal to immediately return or destroy
such information. The Company shall not, nor shall it permit the Company
Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or the Company Subsidiary to,
directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information), or take
any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes a Takeover Proposal or (ii) solicit, initiate, encourage,
facilitate or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
foregoing by any Representative of the Company, any Representative of the
Company Subsidiary or the Company Subsidiary shall be a violation of this
Section by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, constitutes or is likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal (as defined below), and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited in
violation of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 4.02(a), the Company may, if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is required to
do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable law, and after providing written notice of its
decision to take such action to Parent (the " _Company Notice_ ") and
compliance with Section 4.02(c), following delivery of the Company Notice:
(x) furnish information with respect to the Company to any person making such
a Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not
less restrictive of such person as the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined
in Section 5.02) between the Company and Parent (as reasonably determined by
the Company after consultation with its outside counsel), provided that all
such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such
person regarding such a Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or

  



  

26      
   



  

offer from any person relating to any (v) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, (w) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, (x) tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning (as defined in Rule 13d3 under the Exchange Act) 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, (y)
"Rule 13(e)(3) transaction" as defined in Rule 13e-3(a)(3) under the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company, regardless of the form of such transaction
or (z) merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or the
Company Subsidiary, other than the Transactions.

  



  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.02, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval
or recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any
committee thereof of the Merger or the Transactions, (ii) adopt, approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, any Takeover
Proposal (other than from the Parent or Purchaser) or (iii) cause or
authorize the Company or the Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement (each, a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval,
in the event that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside counsel and its financial advisors,
that a Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, if
the Company has fully complied with Section 4.02(a) and if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is
required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable law (subject to this and the
following sentences): (w) withdraw or adversely modify its approval or
recommendation of the Transactions or the matters to be considered at the
Company Stockholders Meeting, (x) approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal, (y) terminate this Agreement and (z) enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, but only after
three business days following Parents receipt of a written notice (" _Notice
of Adverse Recommendation_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board is
prepared to terminate this Agreement (which notice shall include all
information required in a Company Notice) and only if during such three
business day period, the Company and its advisors shall have negotiated in
good faith with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed with the transactions
contemplated herein on such adjusted terms; it being understood and agreed
that any material change in the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal
following such negotiations with Parent shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation from the Company to the Parent and a new three business day
period. In determining whether to send a Notice of Adverse Recommendation in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise. For purposes of
this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means (A) any bona fide written
proposal made by a Third Party that if consummated would result in such Third
Party acquiring, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender
offer,

  



  

27      
   



  

exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the
combined voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
or all or substantially all the assets of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary or (B) any "Rule 13(e)(3) transaction" as defined in Rule
13e-3(a)(3) under the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, regardless of
the form of such transaction, in either case otherwise on terms which the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be
(i) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial
point of view than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Proposal or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such proposal, including, without limitation, the presence or absence of a
financing contingency.

  



  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiary
set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall
promptly advise Parent in writing of any Takeover Proposal, and any Company
Notice shall specify in writing the material terms and conditions of any such
Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making such Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully informed of the status and
material terms and conditions (including any material change to the
terms thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide Parent as soon
as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of any such
Takeover Proposal or correspondence concerning material developments or
material changes with respect to any such Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would
constitute a violation of applicable law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Company, the Company Subsidiary, or the any committee
thereof (or any of their respective representatives or advisors) take, or
agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

  



  

Section 4.03 _Compensation Plans_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the Effective Time, the Company agrees that,
except as set forth in Section 4.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, it
shall not, and it shall not permit the Company Subsidiary to, do any of the
following without the prior written consent of Parent, except as required by
applicable law or pursuant to existing contractual arrangements:

  



  

(a) enter into, adopt or amend any Company Benefit Plans to materially
increase the benefits thereunder;

  



  

(b) grant or become obligated to grant any increase in the compensation or
fringe benefits of directors, officers or employees (including any such

compensation payable or to become payable to any officer, except for
increases in compensation in the ordinary course of

  



  

28      
   



  

business consistent with past practice, or enter into any contract or
arrangement to do any of the foregoing, except for normal increases and non-
stock benefit changes in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice;

  



  

(c) make any material change in any Company Benefit Plans arrangement or
enter into any employment or similar agreement or arrangement with any
employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude the
Company from (i) accelerating, amending or changing the period of
exercisability of outstanding Company Stock Options or authorize cash
payments in exchange for any such Company Stock Options or (ii) accelerating
the vesting of any outstanding Company Stock Option pursuant to Section 16 of
the Company Stock Plan; or

  



  

(d) enter into or renew any contract or arrangement providing for the payment
to any director, officer or employee of compensation or benefits contingent,
or the terms of which are materially altered in favor of such individual,
upon the occurrence of any of the Transactions.

Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

  



  

42

Merger to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,

WHEREAS, Parent, Golden State Vintners, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and Hawk Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), have entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 22, 2004 (as the same may be amended or
supplemented, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), providing for, among other things,
the merger of Company with and into Purchaser (the " _Merger_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder beneficially owns (as such term
is defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) Three Million (3,000,000)
shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Class A Common Stock_ ") (the " _Subject Shares_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into the Merger
Agreement, and as an inducement and in consideration therefor, Parent has
requested that Stockholder enter into this Agreement pursuant to which
Stockholder shall, among other things, vote all of the Subject Shares in
favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
premises, representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

1. _Agreement to Vote_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting Stockholders right to vote the Subject Shares in its
sole discretion on any unrelated matters that may be submitted to a vote,
consent or other approval (including by written consent) of the stockholders
of the Company (as long as such matters are not otherwise contrary to
Stockholders agreement to vote the Subject Shares in the manner set forth in
this Section 1), Stockholder agrees that, during the term of this Agreement,
at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, or in
connection with any written consent of the stockholders of the Company,
Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject Shares (i) in favor
of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and each other action
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any actions required in furtherance
hereof or thereof and (ii) against the adoption of an Adverse Proposal.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Adverse Proposal" means (a)
any Takeover Proposal or (b) the following actions (other than the Merger and
the other Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement): (1) any
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other

combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (3) any sale,
lease or other similar transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or a reorganization,
recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries; or (4) any other action that in any way serves to postpone,
prevent, materially interfere with or materially and adversely affect the
Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 1(b),
Stockholder agrees that, at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on April 28, 2004 (the
"Consent Delivery Date"), Stockholder shall, pursuant to Section 2.6 of the
Bylaws, execute and deliver to the Company and Purchaser an action by written
consent (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) approving
the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement and each other action
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any actions required in furtherance
hereof or thereof, which written consent shall be irrevocable by Stockholder
except as set forth in Section 7(d) of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 1(b) to the contrary, if
the Consent Delivery Date would otherwise occur after a Company Notice and/or
a Notice of Adverse Recommendation has been delivered to Purchaser with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement then in
effect, then the Consent Delivery Date shall be the date that is the seventh
business day following the date of the most recent Notice received by
Purchaser.

  



  

2. _Irrevocable Proxy_.

  



  

(a) _Grant of Proxy_. Stockholder hereby appoints Parent and any designee of
Parent, each of them individually, such Stockholders proxy and attorney-in-
fact during the term of this Agreement, with full power of substitution and
re-substitution, to vote or act by written consent with respect to the
Subject Shares (i) in accordance with Section 1 hereof and (ii) to sign its
name (as a stockholder) to any consent, certificate or other document
relating to the Company that the law of the State of Delaware may permit or
require in connection with any matter referred to in Section 1. This proxy is
given to secure the performance of the duties of Stockholder under this
Agreement and its existence will not be deemed to relieve Stockholder of its
obligations under Section 1. Stockholder affirms that this proxy is coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable until termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7, whereupon such proxy and power of attorney
shall automatically terminate. Stockholder will take such further action or
execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent
of this proxy. The proxy granted herein is intended to comply with
the requirements of Section 212 of the DGCL applicable to irrevocable
proxies.

  



  

(b) _Other Proxies Revoked_. Stockholder represents that any proxy heretofore
given in respect of the Subject Shares is not irrevocable, and hereby revokes
any and all such proxies.

  



  

3. _Standstill_. During the term of this Agreement, Stockholder will not, directly or indirectly: (a) except pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the conversion of Subject Shares at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the Merger

Agreement, offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign
or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to or consent to the offer for the
sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition
of, any or all of the Subject Shares; (b) except pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or as otherwise called for by the Merger Agreement, (i)
deposit any Subject Shares into a voting trust, (ii) grant any proxies or
powers of attorney or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any of
the Subject Shares, or (iii) enter into any other agreement or understanding
with respect to the voting of any of the Subject Shares; (c) convert or
consent to the conversion of any of the Subject Shares into any other class
of capital stock or other securities of the Company including without
limitation, shares of the Companys Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the " _Class B Common Stock_ "); or (d) take any action that would
reasonably be expected to make any of its representations or warranties
contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the
effect of impairing the ability of Stockholder to perform
Stockholders obligations under this Agreement or preventing or delaying the
Merger or consummation of any of the other Transactions **.**

  



  

4 _. No Solicitation_. Stockholder shall, and shall cause each director,
officer, employee, agent and representative (including without limitation any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by Stockholder or any such representative) (each, a
"Stockholder Representative") of Stockholder to, immediately cease any
discussions or negotiations with any other parties conducted heretofore
(other than Parent and the Purchaser) with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
Stockholder shall not, nor shall it permit any Stockholder Representative to,
directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information), or take
any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes a Takeover Proposal or (ii) solicit, initiate,
encourage, facilitate or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the foregoing by Stockholder or any Stockholder Representative shall be a
violation of Section 4.02 of the Merger Agreement by the Company.

appropriate filings under securities laws (which Stockholder agrees to make
promptly), to the extent applicable, and other than as may be set forth in
the Letter Agreement, the execution and delivery of this Agreement do not,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance
with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with, result in a violation or
breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would result in a default) or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation, notice or acceleration under, (i)
Stockholders certificate of limited partnership or similar constituent
documents, (ii) any trust agreement, loan or credit agreement, bond, note,
mortgage, indenture, lease or any other contract, agreement, or instrument to
which Stockholder is a party or by which Stockholder or any of the Subject
Shares is bound, or (iii) any injunction, judgment, writ, decree, order or
ruling applicable to Stockholder; except in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) for conflicts, violations, breaches or defaults that could not
reasonably be expected to prevent, impair, impede or delay the timely
performance by Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

5.5 _ Reliance._ Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is
entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon Stockholders execution,

A-4      
   



  

6.2 _ Execution and Delivery._ This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent,
enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, except that
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or
other laws affecting the enforceability of creditors rights generally.

  



  

6.3 _ No Conflicts._ Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor the performance by Parent of its obligations hereunder will result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would result in a default) or give rise to
any right of termination, amendment, cancellation, or acceleration under, (i)
Parents limited liability company agreement or similar constituent
documents, (ii) any contract, obligation, commitment, agreement, restriction,
understanding, or instrument to which Parent is a party or by which Parent is

Agent.

identity of such representatives, a new certificate of incumbency shall be
executed and delivered to the Escrow Agent by TWG.

Escrow:

  



  

(a) to the Company within five business days after the Escrow Agents receipt
of a notice jointly executed by TWG and the Company stating that: "The
Company is entitled to receive the escrow funds because all of the conditions

(d) to TWG five business days after July 31, 2004 if the Escrow Agent has not
received a written demand from the Company that the Escrow Agent disburse the
Escrow to the Company by the date of such disbursement; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding the receipt by the Escrow Agent of such a demand from
the Company, the Escrow Agent shall not disburse the Escrow to the Company in

Agreement is also satisfied: Section 3.2(a), Section 3.2(e) or Section
3.2(f);

  



  

(e) to the Company within five business days of the Escrow Agents receipt of

referred to in Section 3.2(e) above has been satisfied; or

  



  

(g) to TWG pursuant to a final, non appealable, court order determining that

Section 3.3. Other Duties. The Escrow Agent shall have authority to engage in

fulfill the Escrow Agents duties under this Escrow Agreement. In the event of
a dispute or question as to the Escrow

  



  

B-4      
   



  

Agents duties, or the uncertainty of the Escrow Agent as to how to proceed
in a situation not explicitly addressed by the terms of this Escrow
Agreement, whether because of conflicting demands by the other Parties hereto
or otherwise, the Escrow Agent may, in its discretion (a) interplead all of
the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction, and
thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with
respect to such interpleaded assets or (b) continue to hold the Escrow until
the Escrow Agent has received instructions jointly executed by TWG and the
Company or until a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine the rights of the Parties to the Escrow.

  



  

The Escrow Agent has only those duties as are specifically provided herein,
which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature. The Escrow Agent shall
neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the terms and
conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between the
other Parties hereto in connection herewith, including, without limitation,
the Merger Agreement. This Escrow Agreement sets forth all matters pertinent
to the Escrow contemplated hereunder, and no additional obligations of the
Escrow Agent shall be inferred from the terms of this Escrow Agreement or any
other Agreement.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (i) DAMAGES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES WHICH RESULT FROM THE ESCROW AGENTS
FAILURE TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REASONABLE COMMERCIAL STANDARDS OF THE
BANKING BUSINESS, OR (ii) SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE
ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  



  

ARTICLE IV

  

THE ESCROW AGENT

  



  

Section 4.1. Representations and Warranties of the Escrow Agent.  The Escrow
Agent represents and warrants to TWG and the Company that:

  



  

(i) The Escrow Agent is a national banking association, duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States of
America.

  



  

(ii) The Escrow Agent has full power, authority and legal right to execute,
deliver and perform this Escrow Agreement, and has taken all necessary action
to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

(iii) This Escrow Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Escrow Agent, and, assuming the due execution and delivery by the other
Parties hereto, constitutes the valid, legal and binding agreement of
the Escrow Agent.

  



  

(iv) The execution, delivery and performance by the Escrow Agent of this
Escrow Agreement will not violate any provision or any law or regulation
governing the Escrow Agent.

  



  

Section 4.2. Standard of Care; Exculpation; Indemnity.

  



  

B-5      
   



  

(a) The Escrow Agent, including its officers, directors, employees and
agents, shall be, and hereby is indemnified and held harmless by TWG and the
Company, in equal shares, from all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees
and disbursements that may be imposed on the Escrow Agent or incurred by the
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this
Escrow Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from
this Escrow Agreement or involving its subject matter.  Such amounts shall
be Escrow Expenses.  Agent shall have a first lien on the property and papers
held under this Escrow Agreement for such Escrow Expenses.

  



  

(b) The Escrow Agent may rely, and shall be fully protected in acting, upon
any opinion, notice, order or other instrument or document which the Escrow
Agent reasonably believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented
by the proper Party or Parties, and the Escrow Agent may conclusively rely on
the truth of the statements and correctness of the facts and opinions
expressed therein. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel or accountants
selected by the Escrow Agent and any such opinion of counsel or accountants
appointed with reasonable care shall constitute the full and complete
authorization with respect to any action taken or suffered by the Escrow
Agent in accordance therewith.  The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for
any loss or damage resulting from any action or non-action taken or omitted
in reliance upon any such opinion; provided, that in the event that loss or
damage to either TWG or the Company does occur as a direct result of such
reliance, the Escrow Agent may be named in an action brought by either TWG or
the Company to recover such loss or damages in order to permit the damaged
Party to proceed against such counsel or accountants.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 4.2 and Section 4.3 will survive
the termination of this Escrow Agreement or the resignation or the removal of
the Escrow Agent.

  



  

Section 4.3. Compensation and Expenses. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
be reimbursed and compensated for the Escrow Expenses, pursuant to the
fee schedule attached hereto as Schedule A. TWG and the Company shall share
all Escrow Expenses equally. TWG and the Company shall each pay their
portion of the initial first years escrow fee within 10 business days of the
execution of this Escrow Agreement and shall thereafter pay their share of
Escrow Expenses within a reasonable time after written notice thereof from
the Escrow Agent.

  



  

Section 4.4. Resignation and Removal. The Escrow Agent may resign by an
instrument in writing signed by the Escrow Agent and delivered to TWG and the
Company not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date such resignation is
to be effective. The Escrow Agent may be removed by written agreement of TWG
and the Company. The resignation and removal of the Escrow Agent shall not
operate to terminate the Escrow created by this Escrow Agreement, to revoke
any existing agency created pursuant to the terms of this Escrow Agreement,
or to invalidate any action theretofore taken by the Escrow Agent. Upon any
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent hereunder, the Company shall
designate a successor Escrow Agent, subject to the consent of TWG (such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Upon the appointment
of a successor Escrow Agent, the retiring Escrow Agent shall: (a) promptly
execute and deliver such documents, instruments and other writings as may be
reasonably required by the successor Escrow Agent to effect the termination
of the retiring Escrow Agents capacity under this Escrow Agreement and the
conveyance of the assets of the Escrow then held by the retiring

  



  

B-6      
   



  

Escrow Agent to the successor Escrow Agent; (b) deliver to the successor
Escrow Agent copies of all documents, instruments, records and other writings
related to the Escrow as may be in the possession of the Escrow Agent; (c)
and otherwise assist and cooperate in effecting the assumption of the
obligations and functions of such Escrow Agent. Every successor Escrow Agent
appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver to TWG and the
Company and to the retiring Escrow Agent an instrument accepting such
appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Escrow
Agent shall become effective and such successor Escrow Agent, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights,
powers, trusts and duties of the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE V

  

TERMINATION

  



  

Section 5.1. Termination. This Escrow Agreement shall terminate, and the
Escrow Agent shall be discharged from all further duties (except as otherwise
provided herein) and liabilities under this Escrow Agreement at the date upon

Agent in accordance with Section 3.2 of this Escrow Agreement.
