Closing Working Capital, based upon the accounting books and records of
Company and its subsidiaries (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ ") certified
by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Company as being
prepared in accordance with this Agreement, and (y) underlying documentation
supporting the Estimated Working Capital, including supporting detail for
each of the balance sheet accounts on the Working Capital Closing Statement
and (ii)(x) a written statement (the " _Indebtedness Closing Statement_ ")
reflecting Companys good faith estimate of the Closing Indebtedness, based
upon the accounting books and records of Company and its subsidiaries (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ ") certified as provided above by the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of Company, (y) underlying documentation
supporting the Estimated Indebtedness, including supporting detail for each of

repay all Closing Indebtedness at the Closing with funds provided by TWTC to

Liens relating to the Closing Indebtedness, in accordance with Section 6.7.
The Estimated Indebtedness shall not be less than the amount necessary to fund
the repayment of all Closing Indebtedness at the Closing, including any
prepayment penalties and other costs required in connection therewith. 

(b) The Cash Consideration to be paid at Closing shall be (i)(x) increased by
the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds $1.00 or (y)
reduced by the amount by which $1.00 exceeds the Estimated Working Capital,
and (ii) reduced by the Estimated Indebtedness. Of the Cash Consideration to
be paid at Closing, $6 million (the " _Cash Consideration Escrow_ ") shall be
paid to the Disbursing Agent to be held by the Disbursing  



 

3  Agent in escrow until disbursed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Disbursing Agent Agreement. The Cash Consideration Escrow,
to the extent paid to the members of Company pursuant to this Agreement and
the Disbursing Agent Agreement, shall be considered part of the Cash
Consideration for all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) If TWTC disagrees with Companys calculation of Closing Working Capital
and/or Closing Indebtedness, as reflected in Companys statements of
Estimated Working Capital or Estimated Indebtedness delivered pursuant to
Section 3.2(a), TWTC may, within 45 days after the Closing, deliver a notice
to each of the Members disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth
TWTCs calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall
specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which TWTC
disagrees, and TWTC shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Working Capital Closing Statement and the
Indebtedness Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital
and Closing Indebtedness, respectively, delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(a).
If no such notice is delivered within 45 days after the Closing, then
Companys estimates of Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness
delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(a) shall be final and binding upon TWTC, the
Members and the holders of Company Membership Interests and Equity Interests.

(d) If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(c),
TWTC and the Members shall, during the 15 days following such delivery, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Working Capital and/or
Closing Indebtedness (as applicable). If during such period, TWTC and the
Members are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly (but in any
event by the end of such 15-day period) jointly engage and refer their
remaining differences to the dispute resolution department of Price
Waterhouse Coopers LLP or such other nationally recognized independent
accounting firm as TWTC and the Members may agree (such accounting firm, the "
_Arbitrator_ ") and cause the Arbitrator to review this Agreement and Section
9.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and the disputed items or amounts for
the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness
(as applicable) according to such procedures as the Arbitrator deems
appropriate. In making such calculation, the Arbitrator shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Working Capital Closing Statement and/or the
Indebtedness Closing Statement (as applicable) as to which TWTC has
given timely notice of disagreement. The Arbitrator shall deliver to TWTC and
the Members, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than 30 days
from the date of engagement of the Arbitrator), a report setting forth the
Arbitrators determination of Closing Working Capital and/or Closing
Indebtedness (as applicable), which shall include the Arbitrators
calculations of the components of Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing
Indebtedness as to which TWTC has given timely notice of disagreement (as
applicable); _provided_ that such calculations of the disputed components
shall not be outside the range established by Companys calculations delivered
pursuant to Section 3.2(a), on the one hand, and TWTCs calculations
delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(c), on the other hand. Such report shall be
final and binding upon TWTC, the Members and the holders of Company Membership
Interests and Equity Interests.

(e) TWTC, the Surviving Company and the Members shall cooperate and assist in
the conduct of the review referred to in this Section 3.2, including, without
limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of books, records,
work papers and personnel.



 

4 (f) Within three business days of the final resolution of the amount of
Closing Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness pursuant to this Section
3.2, (i) if applicable, TWTC and the Members shall cause the Disbursing Agent
to distribute to TWTC a portion of the Cash Consideration Escrow, if any,
equal to the sum of (x) the excess, if any, of the Estimated Working Capital
over the final Working Capital as determined pursuant to this Section 3.2 and
(y) the excess, if any, of the final Closing Indebtedness as determined
pursuant to this Section 3.2 over the Estimated Indebtedness, or (ii) if
applicable, TWTC shall deliver to the Disbursing Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to the sum of (x) the
excess, if any, of the final Working Capital as determined pursuant to this
Section 3.2 over the Estimated Working Capital and (y) the excess, if any, of
the Estimated Indebtedness over the final Closing Indebtedness as determined
pursuant to this Section 3.2, plus (z) interest on the sum of (x) and (y) set
forth above in this clause (ii), if any, at the Applicable Rate from (but not
including) the Closing Date through (and including) the date of payment. The
amount remaining in the Cash Consideration Escrow, if any, after any
distribution contemplated by clause (i) of this paragraph (f) and the amount
of cash, if any, delivered to the Disbursing Agent pursuant to clause (ii) of
this paragraph (f) shall be disbursed in the same manner, and subject to the
same terms, as the Cash Consideration paid at Closing is disbursed pursuant to
Section 3.3 of this Agreement and the Disbursing Agent Agreement.

(g) In no event will the Disbursing Agent, the Members, or any other holder of
any Company Membership Interest or Equity Interest have any liability to pay
to TWTC pursuant to this Section 3.2 any amount in excess of the Cash
Consideration Escrow, which shall be TWTCs sole and exclusive remedy if the
final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital or the final
Closing Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Indebtedness.

Section 3.3. _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

(a) On the Effective Date, TWTC shall deliver to a commercial bank or trust
company reasonably satisfactory to the parties, as disbursement agent (the "
_Disbursing Agent_ ") under a Disbursing Agent Agreement substantially in the

Members and Company to be executed by the parties thereto not later than the
Closing Date, (i) the Cash Consideration to be paid at Closing pursuant to
Section 3.2(b), by wire transfer of immediately available funds and (ii) a
global certificate representing the Share Consideration. Pursuant to the
Disbursement Agent Agreement, the Disbursing Agent shall disburse the Cash
Consideration and the Share Consideration to the holders of Company Membership
Interests and Equity Interests in a manner consistent with
Companys operating agreement and other applicable plans and agreements as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth in a notice
provided by Company to the Disbursing Agent immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) The Disbursing Agent, on behalf of each of the Surviving Company and TWTC,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any person pursuant to this Article III such amounts as the
Disbursing Agent, the Surviving Company or TWTC is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision
of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Disbursing Agent so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the persons in respect of which the
Disbursing Agent made such deduction and withholding.



 

5 Section 3.4. _Dividends and Other Distributions_. All shares of TWTC Class A
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and

TWTC, as applicable, shall cooperate with the other in the prompt filing with
the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 and, as

If, at any time prior to the Effective Date, TWTC or Company should discover
any information relating to either party, or any of their respective

or supplement to the Registration Statement so that it would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

cause each of its subsidiaries to afford to the other party and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives (including potential financing sources) of such other party
reasonable access during normal business hours, and in a manner which does not
impair unduly normal business operations, during the period prior to the
Closing Date, to all their properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records (including the foregoing maintained by accountants,
consultants, outsourcers and other representatives of TWTC or Company, as the
case may be). During such period each of TWTC and Company will (i) advise the
other party of any change or event that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on it, and (ii) furnish promptly
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel, in
each case as such the other party may reasonably request; provided, however,
that no actions shall be taken pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) that would
result in a waiver of the attorney/client privilege. Prior to the Closing, to
the extent permitted by applicable law and confidentiality provisions, Company
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, confer on a regular and frequent
basis with one or more representatives of TWTC to discuss
material operational and regulatory matters and the general status of its

Confidentiality Agreement.

TWTC as soon as available, but not later than the 45th day after the end of

file all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary applications,

or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things in
order to obtain all Governmental Consents. TWTC shall have the right to the
extent practicable to prepare and file any of the required applications,
filings or other materials; provided however that Company shall have the right
to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information
relating to Company that appear in any application, notice, petition
or filing made in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Company and TWTC agree that they will consult
and cooperate with each other with respect to the obtaining of all such
necessary approvals and authorizations of Governmental Authorities.

(b) _Further Actions_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining any
required third party consents under Contracts or otherwise and Governmental
Consents, (ii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, and (iii) the execution and

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. TWTC shall not (i)
acquire any business or entity, (ii) merge or consolidate with any entity,

registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be made prior

with, or obtained prior to the Closing by Company or TWTC or any of their
respective subsidiaries from, any Governmental Authority in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.



 

33 (d) _Specified Material Adverse Effect_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as
used in this Section 6.5, "reasonable best efforts" shall not include nor
require any party to (A) sell, or agree to sell, hold or agree to hold
separate, or otherwise dispose or agree to dispose of any asset, in each case
if such sale, separation or disposition or agreement with respect thereto (i)
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on either Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole or on TWTC and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (B) conduct or
agree to conduct its business in any particular manner if such conduct or
agreement with respect thereto would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have any of the effects set forth in Clause A (the
effects in Clause (A) or (B), a " _Specified Material Adverse Effect_ "). None
of Company or any of its subsidiaries may take or agree to take any action, or
consent to or agree to consent to, any such restriction, if it would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Specified
Material Adverse Effect without the prior written consent of TWTC.

(e) _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Without limiting the generality of Section
6.5(b), Company and TWTC shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that
no state antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state anti-takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.6. _Options_. Company shall give the notice described in Section
11(b) of its Employee Option Plan not later than 20 days prior to the

otherwise determined by TWTC, Company shall pay and discharge all
Closing Indebtedness in full on the Closing Date, and cause all Liens,
encumbrances and other obligations related thereto (including Liens with
respect to cash or cash equivalents under any deposit or control agreement or
otherwise) to be released, concurrently with the filing of the Certificate of
Merger pursuant to Section 1.2. TWTC shall contribute to Merger Sub all funds
necessary for such payment and discharge, it being understood that all amounts
necessary to fund such payment and discharge, including any accrued interest,
prepayment penalties and other costs required in connection therewith, shall
be included in Indebtedness and in the Estimated Indebtedness calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(a) and deducted from the Aggregate Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.2(b). At least 15 business days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, Company shall deliver to TWTC a list of any
Indebtedness which it then expects will be outstanding as of the Closing
Date.



 

34 Section 6.8. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Each of Company and TWTC agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees
or fiduciaries under benefit plans currently indemnified by Company and
its subsidiaries (" _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), as provided in its
respective certificate or articles of incorporation, by laws (or comparable
organizational documents) or other agreements providing indemnification, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.

(b) Company may, prior to the Closing Date, purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits to Company Indemnified Parties, or any other person entitled to the
benefit of Sections 6.8(a) and (b), as applicable, as the existing directors
and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by Company,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If such
"tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by Company prior to the Closing Date,
the Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full force and effect,
for its full term, and continue to honor its obligations thereunder and no
other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay
for insurance hereunder.

(c) The obligations of Company and TWTC under this Section 6.8 shall not be
terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to adversely affect
any Company Indemnified Party without the consent of the affected Company
Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

Section 6.9. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated.

Section 6.10. _Public Announcements_. Company and TWTC will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to
review, comment upon and concur with, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as any party, after
consultation with counsel, determines is required by applicable law or
applicable rule or regulation of NASDAQ.

Section 6.11. _Affiliates_. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Company shall deliver to TWTC, and TWTC shall deliver to Company, a
letter identifying all persons who are, at the time this Agreement is
submitted for adoption by the members of Company, "affiliates" of Company or
TWTC, as the case may be, for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
Company and TWTC shall use their respective reasonable best efforts  



 

35  to cause each such person to deliver to TWTC as of the Closing Date, a
written agreement in mutually acceptable customary form.

Section 6.12. _NASDAQ Listing_. TWTC shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of TWTC Common Stock issuable to Companys members as

subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Closing Date.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to: (i) maintain

extensions) required to be filed by or on behalf of each such entity; (iii)

Statements as of December 31, 2005 and for the year then ended; (iv) promptly
notify TWTC of any material suit, claim, action, investigation, audit or
similar proceeding pending against or with respect to Company or any of its

of any material property Tax valuation or assessment, and appeal or contest
any property Tax valuations or assessments diligently and in good faith as if
it were the only party in interest; (vi) not make any material tax election
without TWTCs prior written consent; and (vii) not extend or waive any

prior written consent. Any Tax Returns described in clause (ii) shall be
complete and correct in all material respects. Company shall notify TWTC upon
the filing of any material Tax Return and shall make such Tax Returns
available to TWTC upon request.

(b) The Members shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of any
income or franchise Tax Return of Company or any of its subsidiaries for the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and, in connection therewith, shall
be provided with reasonable access to the books and records of Company and
its subsidiaries as required for such preparation and filing.

(c) For U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes, the parties
shall report and treat the Merger as a taxable sale of partnership interests
by Companys members and as a purchase by TWTC of Companys assets.

(d) As provided in the Disbursing Agent Agreement, Company shall provide to
TWTC a certificate of non-foreign status pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) from each person entitled to receive Merger

ARTICLE VIII

Termination, Amendment and Waiver

Section 8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Company and TWTC;

(b) by either Company or TWTC:

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by January 31, 2007 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement
results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time;

(ii) if any Restraint shall be in effect and shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove such Restraint; or

(iii) if any condition to the obligation of such party to consummate the
Merger set forth in Section 7.2 (in the case of Company) or in Section 7.3
(in the case of TWTC) becomes incapable of satisfaction prior to the
Termination Date; provided, however, that the failure of any such condition to
be capable of satisfaction is not the result of a material breach of
this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement.

(c) by Company, if TWTC shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
(b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by TWTC or is not cured by TWTC
within 120 days following receipt of written notice from Company of such
breach or failure to perform;

(d) by TWTC, if Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
(b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by Company or is not cured by
Company within 120 days following receipt of written notice from TWTC of such
breach or failure to perform; or

(e) by TWTC, if Company shall breach in any material respect its obligations
under Section 5.2 hereof.



 

39 Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either TWTC or Company as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Company or TWTC, other than the
provisions of Section 6.9, this Section 8.2 and Article IX, which provisions
shall survive such termination, and except to the extent that such termination
results from the intentional and willful breach by a party of any of its
representations or warranties, or a breach of its covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, in which case such termination shall not relieve any
party of any liability or damages resulting from its breach of this Agreement.

Section 8.3. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time; provided, however, that there shall not be made any amendment that by
law requires further approval by Companys members without the further
approval of such members. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 8.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, a
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

ARTICLE IX

General Provisions

representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing
Date. This Section 9.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the
parties that by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing Date and
such provisions shall survive the Closing Date.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit
to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof, "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

(b) Each of Company and TWTC has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other section of
the disclosure letter so long as its relevance to the latter section of the
 



 

49  disclosure letter or section of the Agreement is readily apparent on the
face of the information disclosed in the disclosure letter to the person to
which such disclosure is being made. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such
information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a
basis for interpreting the terms "material," "material adverse effect" or
other similar terms in this Agreement.

Section 9.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
party and delivered to the other parties.

Section 9.6.  _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the other agreements, documents and instruments referred
to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement (i) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and (ii) except for the provisions of Section 6.8 (which shall be
enforceable by the Indemnified Parties), are not intended to and shall not
confer upon any person other than the parties to this Agreement any rights or
remedies.

Section 9.7.  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict
of laws.

Section 9.8. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other party other than in connection with a
merger involving a party which is not otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.
Any attempted or purported assignment in violation of the preceding sentence
shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever. Subject to the preceding
two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

Section 9.9. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in any federal or state
court located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of
the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction
of the federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware in the event
any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than a federal or state court in the State of Delaware.



 

50 Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

Section 9.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.
