Amount or (y) the Closing Shares included in the calculation of the Estimated
Closing Shares Number, in each case, to the extent relating to the Closing
Date Net Working Capital or Closing Date Indebtedness, and such adjustments
shall be borne or shared, as applicable, among Members other than the LPC
Member pro rata in accordance with their relative Indemnification Percentages,
in each case, determined in a manner consistent with the sample calculations
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Members
Representative shall provide the Buyer with written notice as to such
allocation.

 



 

(h) At the Closing, Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, the Closing Date Indebtedness constituting
Indebtedness for borrowed money by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with the wire instruction set forth in the Funds Flow and
the Company shall deliver to Buyer customary payoff letters from the holders
of such Closing Date Indebtedness and executed lien release documents,
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, with respect to Liens in or upon the equity,
assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
such Closing Date Indebtedness.

 



 

(i) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the
Company, the Company Transaction Expenses (based upon the Estimated Closing
Date Statement) by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance
with the wire instruction set forth in the Funds Flow.

 



 

(j) At the Closing, each Partner Member receiving Share Consideration shall
sign a joinder to the Employee Shareholders Agreement to which certain
employees of Buyer are a party.

 



 

2.4. _Post-Closing Adjustment to the Estimated Closing Cash Consideration
Amount_.

 



 

(a) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Members Representative a statement (the " _Closing
Date Statement_ ") setting forth (i) the Aggregate Closing Advisory Revenue
Run-Rate and the Run-Rate Adjustment Amount (if any), which shall be
accompanied by such written evidence of Client Consents and the Closing
Advisory Revenue Run-Rates for all of the Advisory Clients with respect to
which Client Consent has been obtained (and not revoked) as of the True-Up
Date, as is reasonably necessary to calculate the Aggregate Closing Advisory
Revenue Run-Rate, (ii) Closing Date Net Working Capital, (iii) Closing Date
Indebtedness, (iv) Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, (v) the Closing
Cash Consideration Amount, calculated in the same manner as the Estimated
Closing Cash Consideration Amount was calculated pursuant to Section 2.3(b),
2.3(c), Section 2.3(d), and Section 2.3(e), using the relevant amounts set
forth in the Closing Date Statement and (vi) the Closing Shares, calculated in
the same manner as the Estimated Closing Share Number was calculated pursuant
to Sections 2.3(b), 2.3(c), 2.3(d), and 2.3(f), using the relevant amounts set
forth in the Closing Date Statement; _provided_ that (A) for purposes of
calculating "Aggregate Closing Advisory Revenue Run-Rate" and the "Run-Rate
Adjustment Amount", in the Closing Date Statement, "True-Up Date" shall
replace "Closing Measurement Date" and, for the avoidance

 



      
 

 



 

of doubt, the "Aggregate Closing Advisory Revenue Run-Rate" shall be adjusted
to add (x) the Closing Assets Under Management (as of the Closing Date, rather
than the Closing Measurement Date) of all Advisory Clients as of the Closing
that had not consented to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
or before the Closing Measurement Date, but consent to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3 as of the
Closing or during the True-Up Period (and such consent is not revoked prior to
the True-Up Date), (y) as an Advisory Client any Advisory Client as of the
Base Date (other than a Member or an Affiliate or family member of a Member)
that terminated its advisory relationship with the Company prior to the
Closing Date, but enters into a new investment advisory contract with the
Company, Buyer or their respective Affiliates on or after the Closing Date and
prior to the True-Up Date, which new advisory agreement provides for the
Company or the Patriot Team to manage assets of such client (a " _Returning
Client_ ") and (z) as Closing Assets Under Management the dollar amount of the
assets any Returning Client placed under management of the Company or the
Patriot Team on the date after the Closing Date on which such Person entered
into a new investment advisory contract with the Company, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates and became a Returning Client, (B) for purposes of
calculating the "Closing Assets Under Management" and "Closing Fee Rate" in
the Closing Date Statement, "Closing Date" shall replace "Closing Measurement
Date" and (C) for purposes of calculating "Aggregate Closing Advisory Revenue
Run-Rate" in the Closing Date Statement, a Returning Client will be deemed to
have given a Client Consent as of the True-Up Date, and for purposes of
calculating "Closing Fee Rate" in the Closing Date Statement, a Returning
Clients Closing Fee Rate shall be the stated fee rate payable to the Company
or the Patriot Team under the Returning Clients new investment advisory
contract with the Company, Buyer or their respective Affiliates as calculated
in accordance with the definition of Closing Fee Rate. The Run-Rate Adjustment
Amount as recalculated pursuant to this Section 2.4(a) is the " _True-Up Run-
Rate Adjustment Amount_ ".

 



 

(b) Adjustments to the Closing Cash Consideration Amount or Closing Shares
shall reflect the calculations set forth in the Closing Date Statement and
shall be made as follows and in accordance with Section 2.4(e) (the " _Closing
Consideration Adjustment_ "):

 



 

(i) In the event that the Closing Cash Consideration Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.4 is greater than the Estimated Closing
Cash Consideration Amount:

 



 

(A) Buyer shall pay (or deliver, as applicable) to the Members in accordance
with Section 2.4(e) (x) an aggregate amount equal to (i) ninety percent (90%)
of (ii) the excess of the Closing Cash Consideration Amount over the Estimated
Closing Cash Consideration Amount and (y) a number of shares of Class B Common
Stock equal to (i) ninety percent (90%) of (ii) the excess of the Closing
Shares over the Estimated Closing Share Number;

 



 

(B) Buyer shall pay (or deliver, as applicable) to the Escrow Agent to deposit
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (x) an aggregate amount equal to (i) ten percent
(10%) of (ii) the excess of the Closing Cash Consideration Amount over the
Estimated Closing Cash Consideration Amount and (y) a number of shares of
Class B Common Stock equal to (i) ten percent (10%) of (ii) the excess of the
Closing Shares over the Estimated Closing Share Number;

 



      
 

 



 

(C) (x) the cash portion of the Adjustment Escrow Fund will be paid to the
Members in proportion to such Members Closing Cash Percentage and (y) the
share portion of the Adjustment Escrow Fund will be delivered to the Members
in proportion to such Members Share Percentage;

 



 

(D) _provided_ , _however_ , that the sharing of the cash paid or shares
delivered to the Members pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(i)(A) and (C) shall be
adjusted such that only the Members other than the LPC Member receive such
portion of the Closing Consideration Adjustment to the extent relating to the
Closing Date Net Working Capital and/or Closing Date Indebtedness (to be
shared among the Members other than the LPC Member pro rata in accordance with
their relative Indemnification Percentages), in each case, determined in a
manner consistent with the sample calculations attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Members Representative shall provide
the Buyer with written notice as to such allocation.

 



 

(ii) In the event that the Estimated Closing Cash Consideration Amount is
greater than the Closing Cash Consideration Amount as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4:

 



 

(A) (x) an aggregate amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Closing Cash
Consideration Amount over the Closing Cash Consideration Amount and (y) a
number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to the excess of the Estimated
Closing Share Number over the Closing Shares shall each be paid and/or
delivered, on a ratable basis, to Buyer out of the Adjustment Escrow Fund;

 



 

(B) (x) any cash amounts remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Fund after such
payment to Buyer will be paid to the Members in proportion to such Members
Closing Cash Percentage and (y) any shares remaining in the Adjustment Escrow
Fund after such delivery to Buyer will be delivered to the Members in
proportion to such Members Share Percentage;

 



 

(C) _provided_ , _however_ , that any Closing Consideration Adjustment in
favor of Buyer made in accordance with Section 2.4(b)(ii)(A) shall be borne
solely by the Members other than the LPC Member (by way of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund or, directly in accordance with Section 2.4(b)(iii)), pro rata in
accordance with their relative Indemnification Percentages, to the extent such
Closing Consideration Adjustment relates to the Closing Date Net Working
Capital and/or Closing Date Indebtedness, in each case, determined in a manner
consistent with the sample calculations attached hereto as _Exhibit C_, and
the sharing of any payments out of the Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Members
shall be appropriately adjusted to achieve such result; provided, that if
there are insufficient funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund or there is
otherwise an Adjustment Escrow Shortfall Amount, then the Members other than
the LPC Member hereby agree, severally and not jointly, to promptly pay such
amount in cash to the LPC Member as necessary to achieve the foregoing;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Members Representative shall provide the
Buyer with written notice as to such allocation.

 



 

(iii) If there is any Adjustment Escrow Shortfall Amount, then, at Buyers
option, such Adjustment Escrow Shortfall Amount shall be recovered by Buyer
(1) out of

 



      
 

 



 

the Indemnity Escrow Amount or (2) from each Member in accordance with such
Members Indemnification Percentage of the Adjustment Escrow Shortfall Amount.

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, if the True-Up Run-Rate Adjustment Amount is
less than the Run-Rate Adjustment Amount determined for purposes of Section
2.3, such that the Closing Cash Consideration Amount is greater than the
Estimated Closing Cash Consideration Amount, the payment made by Buyer to the
Members in accordance with Section 2.4(b)(i) shall be in addition to any
amounts equal to the True-Up Run-Rate Adjustment Amount paid as part of the
Current Year Payment pursuant to Section 2.5.

 



 

(c) If the Members Representative disagrees with the determination of the
Closing Consideration Adjustment, the Members Representative shall notify
Buyer in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after delivery
of the Closing Date Statement to the Members Representative (the " _Objection
Disputes_ "). During the thirty (30) day period of its review, the Members
Representative shall have reasonable access to any documents, schedules or
work papers used in the preparation of the Closing Date Statement. The failure
of the Members Representative to deliver written notice of an Objection
Dispute to Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Date
Statement to the Members Representative shall be deemed acceptance of the
Closing Date Statement and agreement to the Closing Consideration Adjustment
amounts by the Members.

 



 

(d) Subject to this Section 2.4(d), Buyer and the Members Representative
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Objection Dispute and any
resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and the Members Representative shall
be final and binding upon the parties. If Buyer and the Members
Representative are unable to resolve all Objection Disputes within thirty (30)
days of delivery of written notice of such Objection Disputes by the Members
Representative to Buyer, then the disputed matters shall be referred for final
determination to the Accounting Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days
thereafter, notwithstanding good faith negotiation between Buyer and the
Members Representative. The Accounting Arbitrator shall be directed to only
consider those items and amounts set forth on the Closing Date Statement as to
which Buyer and the Members Representative have disagreed within the time
periods and on the terms specified in this Section 2.4(d) and Section 2.4(e)
and shall be directed to resolve all unresolved Objection Disputes in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall be directed to deliver to Buyer and the Members
Representative, as promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60)
days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of
any unresolved Objection Disputes determined in accordance with the terms
herein. The Accounting Arbitrator shall be directed to select as a resolution
for any unresolved Objection Disputes a position within the range of values
assigned to such Objection Dispute by Buyer and the Members Representative
(based solely on presentations and supporting material provided by the parties
and not pursuant to any independent review). Such report shall, absent
manifest error, be final and binding upon all of the parties to this
Agreement. Upon the agreement of Buyer and the Members Representative or the
decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, or if the Members Representative fails
to deliver written notice of disagreement to Buyer within the thirty (30) day
period provided in this Section 2.4(d), the Closing Date Statement, as
adjusted if necessary pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed
to be the Closing Date Statement for purposes of calculating the Closing
Consideration Adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.4. Buyer and the Members
shall each be responsible for the fees and expenses of the

 



      
 

 



 

Accounting Arbitrator pro rata, as between Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Members, on the other hand, in proportion to the relative difference between
the positions taken by Buyer and the Members Representative compared to the
determination of the Accounting Arbitrator, with the fees and expenses for
which the Members are responsible to be payable solely out of (i) any Closing
Consideration Adjustment to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(b) to the Members
and (ii) if there is no Closing Consideration Adjustment to be paid to the
Members, or to the extent the amount of the Closing Consideration Adjustment
otherwise payable to the Members is insufficient to cover such fees and
expenses, the Adjustment Escrow Fund.

 



 

(e) Any cash portion of the Closing Consideration Adjustment shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
party receiving such payment within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination of the Closing Consideration Adjustment or any portion thereof.
Any Closing Consideration Adjustment to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(b) to
the Members shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as the
Estimated Closing Cash Consideration Amount was allocated (subject to, for the
avoidance of doubt, the proviso in Section 2.3(b)(i)(D)).

 



 

(f) For all Tax purposes, any Closing Consideration Adjustment shall be
treated by the parties hereto as an adjustment to the purchase price.

 



 

2.5. _Earnout_.

 



 

(a) _Earnout Amounts_.

 



 

(i) Following the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each
Member as additional consideration for the purchase of such Members Class A
Units, such Members Earnout Percentage of the Current Year Payment, if any,
in respect of each Earnout Period upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Section 2.5.

 



 

(ii) If, for any Earnout Period (such period, the " _Current Earnout Period_
") after the First Earnout Period, (1) an aggregate amount equal to the Target
Payment Amount has not previously become payable with respect to any Earnout
Period(s) prior to the Current Earnout Period (each such prior Earnout Period,
a " _Prior Earnout Period_ "), pursuant to (x) Section 2.5(a)(i) and (y) any
previous Catch-Up Payment (as defined below) made in accordance with this
Section 2.5(a)(ii) with respect to such Prior Earnout Period and (2) the
Patriot Net Revenue for the then-Current Earnout Period exceeds the higher of
(x) the Patriot Net Revenue for such Prior Earnout Period and (y) if Catch-Up
Payment(s) previously became payable in respect of such Prior Earnout Period
in accordance with this Section 2.5(a)(ii), the Patriot Net Revenue for any
subsequent Earnout Period previously used to calculate a Catch-Up Payment that
became payable in accordance with this Section 2.5(a)(ii) with respect to such
Prior Earnout Period (such higher amount of Patriot Net Revenue, the "
_Previous Patriot Net Revenue Highwater Mark_ "), Buyer shall pay to the
Members in respect of such Prior Earnout Period(s) an amount equal to the
product of (A) the Prior Period Incremental Percentage and (B) the Target
Payment Amount (each such amount, a " _Catch-Up Payment_ "), upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 2.5. For the avoidance
of doubt, Catch-Up Payments may be paid in respect of multiple Prior Earnout
Periods.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Any Catch-Up Payment that becomes payable in accordance with Section
2.5(a)(ii) shall be paid concurrently with the Current Year Payment in respect
of the Current Earnout Period for which Patriot Net Revenues result in such
Catch-Up Payments, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Section 2.5.

 



 

(iv) From and after the Closing, through the end of the Third Earnout Period,
on an annual basis and upon the reasonable request of either individual
comprising the Members Representative, Buyer shall provide to the Members
Representative information, including financial information, reasonably
necessary to determine the Current Year Payments and Catch-Up Payments,
including with respect to the determination of Patriot Net Revenue (and any
documents, schedules or work papers used in connection with the foregoing).

 



 

(b) _Earnout Statement_.

 



 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the end of each Earnout Period, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Members Representative a statement (each, an "
_Earnout Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers good faith calculation of Patriot
Net Revenue for such Earnout Period, any Current Year Payment in respect of
such Earnout Period, any Catch-Up Payments that have become payable in respect
of a prior Earnout Period in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(ii) as a result of
the Patriot Net Revenue for such Earnout Period and any Catch-Up Payments to
be paid in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(iii) upon payment of any Current
Year Payment in respect of such Earnout Period.

 



 

(ii) If the Members Representative disagrees with an Earnout Statement, the
Members Representative shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement
within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Earnout Statement to the
Members Representative (each, an " _Earnout Objection Disputes_ "). During
the thirty (30) day period of its review, the Members Representative shall
have reasonable access to any documents, schedules or work papers used in the
preparation of such Earnout Statement. The failure of the Members
Representative to deliver written notice of an Earnout Objection Dispute to
Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of an Earnout Statement to the
Members Representative shall be deemed acceptance of such Earnout Statement
and agreement to the applicable Earnout Amount by the Members Representative.

 



 

(iii) Subject to Section 2.5(b)(ii), Buyer and the Members Representative
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Earnout Objection Dispute and any
resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and the Members Representative shall
be final and binding upon the parties. If Buyer and the Members
Representative are unable to resolve all matters in an Earnout Objection
Dispute within thirty (30) days of delivery of written notice of such Earnout
Objection Dispute by the Members Representative to Buyer, then the disputed
matters shall be referred for final determination to the Accounting Arbitrator
within fifteen (15) days thereafter. The Accounting Arbitrator shall be
directed to only consider those items and amounts set forth on the applicable
Earnout Statement as to which Buyer and the Members Representative have
disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified in Section
2.5(b)(ii) and Section 2.5(b)(iii) and shall be directed to resolve all
unresolved matters in the applicable Earnout Objection Dispute in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall be directed to deliver to Buyer and the Members Representative, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after its

 



      
 

 



 

appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of any unresolved
matters in the applicable Earnout Objection Dispute determined in accordance
with the terms herein. The Accounting Arbitrator shall be directed to select
as a resolution for any unresolved matters in the applicable Earnout Objection
Dispute a position within the range of values assigned to such Earnout
Objection Dispute by Buyer and the Members Representative (based solely on
presentations and supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant
to any independent review). Such report shall, absent manifest error, be final
and binding upon all of the parties to this Agreement. Upon the agreement of
Buyer and the Members Representative or the decision of the Accounting
Arbitrator, or if the Members Representative fails to deliver written notice
of disagreement to Buyer within the thirty (30) day period provided in Section
2.5(b)(ii), the applicable Earnout Statement, as adjusted if necessary
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be the Earnout
Statement for purposes of calculating the Earnout Amount pursuant to this
Section 2.5. Buyer and the Members Representative shall each be responsible
for the fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator pro rata, as between
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Members, on the other hand, in proportion to
the relative difference between the positions taken by Buyer and the Members
Representative compared to the determination of the Accounting Arbitrator,
with the fees and expenses for which the Members are responsible to be payable
solely out of any Earnout Amounts to be paid to the Members.

 



 

(c) _Payment of Earnout Amounts_. Within fifteen (15) Business Days following
the final determination of the applicable Earnout Statement, Buyer shall pay
to each Member, such Members Earnout Percentage of any Current Year Payment
in respect of such Earnout Period and any Catch-Up Payments to be paid upon
payment of such Current Year Payment, in each case as indicated on such
Earnout Statement, such payments (in the aggregate, the " _Due Amount_ ") to
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such Member, subject to Buyers right of offset set forth in
Article X. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Buyer be obligated to pay more than an aggregate of $100,000,000
in a given calendar year (exclusive of interest payable pursuant to this
Section 2.5(c)) in respect of Due Amounts (such limitation, the " _Annual
Payment Limitation_ "). To the extent that any Due Amount (or previously
Deferred Due Amount) is not required to be paid as a result of the Annual
Payment Limitation (such unpaid amount, a " _Deferred Due Amount_ "), such
Deferred Due Amount shall instead be become payable by Buyer: (i) when Due
Amounts are payable in the succeeding calendar year pursuant to this Section
2.5(c), subject to the Annual Payment Limitation for that year; or (ii) if
there are no Due Amounts for the next succeeding calendar year, March 1 of
such year, subject to the Annual Payment Limitation for that year. Deferred
Due Amounts will accrue interest, compounded annually, from the date they
would have been payable but for the operation of the Annual Payment Limitation
pari passu with similar obligations of Buyer and at the same interest rate
then borne by Buyers term debt under its credit facility; _provided_ , that,
if there is a default by Buyer of the payment obligations of this Section
2.5(c), then, without limiting any of the Members remedies herein, the
applicable interest rate shall be the same interest rate as market unsecured
borrowing rates. Such interest will become payable to each Member in
accordance with its Earnout Percentage when the underlying Deferred Due Amount
is payable, but, in any event, no less frequently than annually. Buyer agrees
that the Deferred Due Amount and interest accrued thereon shall not be
subordinated to any debt obligations of Buyer other than Buyers senior
secured credit facility. For Tax purposes, the parties shall treat the payment
of any Earnout Amount as an adjustment to the purchase price, except to the
extent required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Operation of Patriot Business From Closing Through the Aggregate Earnout
Period_. From and after the Closing, through the end of the Third Earnout
Period, Buyer shall (i) act reasonably and in good faith, including in
connection with the operation of the business of the Company (as conducted by
the Patriot Team following the Closing), and refrain from taking any action
the principal purpose of which is to reduce, circumvent or minimize the
Earnout Amount, (ii) provide full and fair access to Buyers and its
Subsidiaries distribution systems on a basis at least commensurate with that
generally provided by Buyer to its other investment teams and franchises, and
(iii) consider in good faith (including, if applicable, with respect to the
timing of the launch thereof) additional products and strategies proposed in
good faith by the Patriot Team; _provided_ , that the Companys business
shall, subject to this Section 2.5(d), be managed in the discretion of Buyer
during the Earnout Period. Without limiting the foregoing, (x) the prior
written consent of the Members Representative shall be required to re-assign
or otherwise divert the provision of Investment Services away from the Patriot
Team (other than in connection with a Change of Control for which the Change
in Control Payment is due) and (y) Buyer shall not cause a condition that
leads to a resignation by a Principal Employee for Good Reason (as defined in
the Employment Documentation) that is effectuated by a Principal Employee
prior to the end of the Third Earnout Period, or terminate the employment of
either Principal Employee prior to the end of the Third Earnout Period unless
such termination is a Permissible Termination (as such term is defined in the
Employment Documentation) pursuant to the terms of the Employment
Documentation.

 



 

(e) _Earnout Cap_. In no event shall the payments made under this Section 2.5
(exclusive of any interest payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c)) exceed (i) the
Target Payment Amount in respect of any individual Earnout Period or (ii)
three times the Target Payment Amount in the aggregate.

 



 

2.6. _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, the Members
Representative shall prepare, at the Members expense, and deliver to Buyer a
written allocation (the " _Tax Allocation Statement_ ") of the purchase price,
including any Closing Consideration Adjustment paid to the Members (as
determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), among the Companys assets
in accordance with Sections 751 and 1060 of the Code, and in accordance with
the principles set forth on _Exhibit F_. If Buyer disagrees with the Tax
Allocation Statement, Buyer shall notify the Members Representative in
writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after the Members
Representatives delivery of the Tax Allocation Statement. Buyer and the
Members Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement and shall amend the Tax Allocation Statement to reflect any
resolution agreed to in writing.

 



 

(b) Buyer and the Members Representative shall work together in good faith to
amend the Tax Allocation Statement to the extent necessary to reflect any
post-Closing adjustments to the purchase price (as determined for U.S. federal
income tax purposes), whether due to payments made under Section 2.4 (Post-
Closing Adjustment to the Estimated Closing Cash Consideration Amount),
Section 2.5 (Earnout), or otherwise.

 



 

(c) Any disagreement described in Section 2.6(a) or regarding any amendment
described in Section 2.6(b) that Buyer and the Members Representative are
unable to resolve

 



      
 

 



 

through good faith negotiations shall be submitted to the Accounting
Arbitrator for resolution in a manner similar to that described in Section
2.4(d), subject to such deadlines as may be mutually agreed among Buyer, the
Members Representative and the Accounting Arbitrator, and the Tax Allocation
Statement shall be amended to reflect the Accounting Arbitrators resolution
of any such disagreements.

 



 

(d) Buyer and the Members Representative shall and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to (i) file all Tax Returns (including, if necessary,
IRS Form 8594 and any amendments thereto necessitated by any of the events
described in Section 2.6(b)) in a manner consistent with the Tax Allocation
Statement (including any amendments thereto pursuant to this Section 2.6), and
(ii) take no position that is inconsistent with the Tax Allocation Statement
on any Tax Return or in connection with any proceeding, unless required to do
so by the final determination of a Taxing Authority.

 



 

2.7. _Delivery of Deferred Shares_.

 



 

(a) Within ten (10) Business Days following the end of the First Quarter
Measurement Period, Buyer shall issue to each Partner Member, such Partner
Members Share Percentage of the First Quarter Deferred Shares.

 



 

(b) Within ten (10) Business Days following the end of the Second Quarter
Measurement Period, Buyer shall issue to each Partner Member, such Partner
Members Share Percentage of the Second Quarter Deferred Shares.

 



 

(c) Within ten (10) Business Days following the end of the Third Quarter
Measurement Period, Buyer shall issue to each Partner Member, such Partner
Members Share Percentage of the Third Quarter Deferred Shares.

 



 

(d) Within ten (10) Business Days following the end of the Fourth Quarter
Measurement Period, Buyer shall issue to each Partner Member, such Partner
Members Share Percentage of the Fourth Quarter Deferred Shares.

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, for tax purposes, the Partner Members shall be
deemed holders of shares of Class B Common Stock held in the Adjustment Escrow
Fund or Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
and any dividends or similar distributions that are distributed to the holders
of Class B Common Stock in respect thereof shall be placed into such escrows
and, if applicable, delivered to the Partner Members together when the
applicable shares of Class B Common Stock are so delivered, and such Closing
Shares or Deferred Shares shall be subject to any subdivision (by stock split,
by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), combination (by reclassification
or otherwise) or change into the same or a different number of shares of any
other class or classes of stock of Buyer or of any other Person, whether by
capital reorganization, reclassification, merger, exchange or otherwise, on
the same terms and concurrently with such subdivision, combination, or change
of the issued and outstanding Class B Common Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

2.8. _Withholding_.

 



 

In the event that any of the Members does not provide an IRS Form W-9 and the
FIRPTA Certificate (as defined herein), or if there is a change in applicable
Law after the date hereof that would require withholding, Buyer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the purchase price payable hereunder, or
other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, the amounts
required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any
U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts so withheld shall
be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Member or Members to whom the withholding is attributable.

 



 

ARTICLE III _ 
Representations and Warranties of the Company_

 



 

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule (it being agreed that
any matter disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to any
section of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to any other section to the extent the applicability thereto is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Buyer as follows as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date:

 



 

3.1. _Organization and Power_.

 



 

The Company is a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has full
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have all power and authority, and possesses all Permits
necessary to enable it to own or lease and to operate its properties and

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and none of such Company
Regulatory Documents, as of their respective dates, contained any untrue

cause a violation of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. None of the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, or any of the persons associated with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as specified in Rule 506(d) of
Regulation D under the Securities Act is subject to any of the disqualifying
events listed in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and, to

instance of material non-compliance by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their

for or with any Governmental Authority. No Company Adviser or any covered
associate of a Company Adviser has made a contribution to an official of a

Advisers Act) in excess of the de minimis limits set forth in Rule 206(4)-5
under the Advisers Act.

 



 

(i) Since January 1, 2016, all performance records of the Company Advisers and

in all material respects in accordance with the Global Investment Performance
Standards (" _GIPS_ ") and have undergone verification completed by Alpha
Performance Verification Services, an independent third party in compliance
with the Guidance Statement on Verifier Independence, for the period from May
1, 2014 through September 30, 2017, and such verification has been provided to
Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company maintains all

Company Advisers include in any Performance Record or Composite (current and
historical performance results) as required by GIPS to support any Company
Advisers claim of GIPS compliance and as required by the Advisers Act, rules
and regulations thereunder and applicable "no-action" letters. Any investment
performance earned at a firm other than a Company Adviser and presented by a
Company Adviser is in compliance with the Advisers Act and GIPS investment
performance portability requirements, and the Company maintains all
documentation necessary to form the basis for, demonstrate or recreate the
calculation of the performance or rate of return of such performance
presentation and appropriate disclosure relating to the source of the results
is provided. No materials published, circulated or distributed by or on behalf
of any Company Adviser to any Advisory Client or prospective advisory client

requirements of the Securities Laws.

no Plan is (i) subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or
4971 of the Code, (ii) a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, or (iii) a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two
of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of
ERISA, and none of the Company, or any ERISA Affiliate has withdrawn at any
time within the preceding six years from any multiemployer plan, or incurred
any withdrawal liability which remains unsatisfied, and no events have
occurred and no circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to
result in any such liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No
Plan covers any employee outside of the United States.

 



 

(c) No event has occurred and no condition exists that would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries solely by reason of
their affiliation with any ERISA Affiliate (other than the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) to any (i) Tax, penalty, fine, (ii) lien, or (iii) other
liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws, in each case,
in respect of any employee benefit plan maintained, sponsored, contributed to,
or required to be contributed to by any ERISA Affiliate (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

 



 

(d) With respect to each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code, such plan has received a determination letter (or opinion
letters) from the IRS that it is so qualified, and nothing has occurred with
respect to the operation of any such plan which would reasonably be expected
to cause the loss of such qualification or the imposition on the Company of
any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code as a result of
non-compliance with the rules applicable to such Plan under ERISA and the
Code. No stock or other securities issued by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries forms or has formed any part of the assets of any Plan that is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code.

 



 

(e) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
actions, claims or lawsuits against the Plans, the assets of any of the trusts
under such Plans or the Plan sponsor or the Plan administrator, or against any
fiduciary of the Plans with respect to the operation of such Plans (other than
routine benefits claims) that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability to the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Plan is
presently under audit or examination (nor has written notice been received of
a potential audit or examination) by any Governmental Authority, such
representation being to the Knowledge of the Company in respect of Plans
identified in Item #1 in Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(f) Each Plan has been established, administered and funded in accordance with
its terms, and in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. There is not now, nor
do any circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to,
any requirement for the posting of security by the Company

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to a Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. All premiums due
or payable by the Company with respect to insurance policies funding any Plan
have been timely made or paid in full by the Company or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the Financial Statements to the extent required thereunder in

none of the Plans provide retiree health or life insurance benefits except as
may be required by Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA, any
other applicable law or at the expense of the participant or the participants
beneficiary. There has been no material violation of the "continuation
coverage requirement" of "group health plans" as set forth in Section 4980B of
the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA with respect to any Plan
to which such continuation coverage requirements apply.

 



 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination
with another event) (i) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the
amount of any compensation or benefits due, to any current or former employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or with respect to any Plan; (ii) increase
any benefits otherwise payable under any Plan; (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such compensation or
benefits; or (iv) to the Knowledge of the Company, result in a non-exempt
"prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or section
4975 of the Code. No person is entitled to receive any additional payment
(including any tax gross-up or other payment) from the Company as a result of
the imposition of the excise taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code or any
taxes required by Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination
with another event) result in the payment of any amount that would,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(j) Each Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined
in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) either is not subject to the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code or is in documentary compliance, and has been
administered in compliance, in all material respects with Section 409A of the
Code.

period ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (B) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date; (C) prepaid
amount received on or prior to the Closing Date; or (D) any election made or
amount received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or before the

Subsidiaries has been treated as either a partnership or a disregarded entity
at all times since its formation.

 



      
 

 



 

3.17. _Funds_.

 



 

(a) Each Patriot Fund has been duly organized and is validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, or is a
series of an entity that has been duly organized and is validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and
has the requisite power, right and authority to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where such lack of such power, right or authority,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the applicable Patriot Fund or Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each Patriot Registered Fund is, and at all times required by
applicable law has been, (i) duly registered with the SEC as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act or (ii) a series of a duly registered
investment company under the Investment Company Act.

 



 

(b) (i) Each Patriot Fund has complied since January 1, 2016, and is in
compliance, in all material respects with its investment policies and
investment restrictions, if any, as such policies and restrictions may be set
forth in its Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information or private
offering memorandum (as each may be amended from time to time) and in
applicable Laws, if any. There is no Action pending against any Patriot Fund
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Patriot Fund,
except where such pending or threatened Action, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on such Patriot Fund or Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no material
Order or regulatory restriction imposed on any Patriot Fund that is not
generally imposed on similarly situated investment companies or funds. Each
Patriot Fund is, and since January 1, 2016 has been, in compliance with all
applicable Law, other than, in each case, any non-compliance that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on such Patriot Fund or Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each Patriot Fund,

requirement regarding privacy notices to Patriot Registered Fund shareholders.

 



 

(c) Each prospectus, statement of additional information or offering
memorandum (" _Prospectus_ ") used to offer shares or other interests in a
Patriot Fund has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of
applicable Laws and has not included an untrue statement of material fact or
omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except for any failure to comply that, individually or in the
aggregate with any such other failures, would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the applicable Patriot Fund or Company
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2016, all material Prospectuses,
financial statements, other forms, reports, sales literature and advertising,
and any other documents required to be filed by or on behalf of each Patriot
Registered Fund with any applicable Governmental Authority (the " _Reports_ ")
have been timely filed, except where the failure to timely file a Report,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the applicable Patriot Registered Fund or Company
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2016, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, the Reports have been prepared in compliance with the requirements of
applicable Laws, except for any failure to comply that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the applicable Patriot Registered Fund or Company Material Adverse Effect.

or default on the part of the applicable Patriot Fund, or to the Knowledge of
the Company, any other Person, except for such matters that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the applicable Patriot Fund or Company Material Adverse Effect, and
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not result in
any such violation. All Investment Services have been rendered to a Patriot
Registered Fund by the Company pursuant to Advisory Contracts that were
approved by the duly constituted (including having a majority of "non-
interested" members) board of trustees of the applicable Patriot Registered
Fund, in all material respects in accordance with Section 15 of the Investment
Company Act and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the holders of
shares in the Patriot Registered Funds.

There have been no "material compliance matters", as such term is defined in
Rule 38a-1(e)(2) under the Investment Company Act, with respect to any Patriot
Registered Fund, other than those which have been reported to the board of
trustees the applicable Patriot Registered Fund and satisfactorily remedied or
are in the process of being remedied. All payments, if any, by or with respect
to each Patriot Registered Fund relating to the distribution of the Patriot
Registered Funds shares (other than payments that are not required by
applicable Laws to be paid pursuant to a 12b-1 Plan) have been made in
material compliance with the related 12b-1 Plan and each 12b-1 Plan adopted by
or for each of the Patriot Registered Funds, and the operation of each such
12b-1 Plan currently complies with Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act
and other applicable Laws in all material respects. No Patriot Registered Fund

of preemptive or similar rights or applicable Law. All outstanding shares and
other interests of a Patriot Registered Fund that were required to be
registered under the Securities Act have been sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed thereunder (and, where applicable, under the
Investment Company Act) and are qualified for sale or an exemption therefrom
is in full force and effect, in each state and territory of the United States
and the District of Columbia and in any foreign jurisdiction to the extent
required under applicable Law, and no such registration statement is subject
to any stop order or similar order restricting its use, other than, in each
case, any failure to be registered or qualified that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the applicable Patriot Registered Fund or Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each Patriot Private Fund complies, and since inception has complied, with the
requirements of Section 3(C)(1) of the Investment Company Act.

be timely filed) all federal income and other material Tax Returns required to
be filed by it (taking into account any applicable extensions or waivers) with
any Taxing Authority and has timely paid (or caused to be paid) all Taxes
shown on such Tax Returns. There is no currently pending or proposed in
writing audit of such Tax Returns. There are no outstanding waivers or
comparable consents given by any Patriot Fund regarding the application of the
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes.

 



 

(j) Since January 1, 2016, there have not been any pricing errors with respect
to a Patriot Registered Fund asset or a Patriot Registered Fund shareholder

as of the Closing Date as follows:

 



 

5.1. _Organization and Power_.

 



 

Buyer is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the state of Delaware and has full power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it is
a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions. Except as would not have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect, Buyer is not in default under or in violation of any provision
of its organizational documents, and all such documents are in full force and
effect.

 



 

5.2. _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 



 

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to
which Buyer is a party and the performance by Buyer of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by Buyer and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Buyer (including, without limitation, any
shareholder vote or approval) are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to
which Buyer is a party or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
that are required to be performed by Buyer. This Agreement is, and each of the
Ancillary Documents to be executed and delivered at the Closing by Buyer will
be at the Closing, duly authorized, executed and delivered by Buyer and
constitute, or as of the Closing Date will constitute, valid and legally
binding agreements of Buyer enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles.

 



 

5.3. _No Violation_.

 



 

The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents to which Buyer is a party, consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions and performance by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents to

 



       
 

 



 

which Buyer is a party will not (a) conflict with or violate any provision of
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents
of Buyer, or (b) assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations
contemplated by Section 5.4 and Section 6.3 have been obtained and all filings
described therein have been made, conflict with or violate in any material
respect any Law applicable to Buyer or by which its respective properties are
bound, except, in the cases of clause (b), to the extent such conflict,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.4. _Governmental Authorizations and Consents_.

 



 

No Governmental Consents are required to be obtained or made by Buyer in
connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents to which Buyer is,
or is to be, a party, or the consummation by Buyer of the Contemplated
Transactions, other than compliance with the HSR Act, and except for those for
which the failure to obtain such Governmental Consents, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

5.5. _Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act_.

 



 

None of Buyer or any of its "interested persons" (as that term is defined
under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act) has any express or
implied understanding or arrangement which would impose an "unfair burden" (as
such term is used in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) on any of
the Patriot Registered Funds or the Buyer Fund Series as a result of the
Contemplated Transaction or would otherwise cause a violation of Section 15(f)
of the Investment Company Act in connection with the Contemplated Transaction.

 



 

5.6. _Actions_.

 



 

There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened,
involving Buyer or its properties or business, at Law or in equity or before
any Governmental Authority, except where such pending or threatened Actions,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.7. _Financial Capacity_.

 



 

(a) Attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ is a true and complete fully executed copy
of a debt commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (as amended,
restated, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified or waived in accordance
with Section 6.10(c), the " _Commitment Letter_ "), among the Financing
Sources and Buyer, pursuant to which the Financing Sources have committed to
provide or cause to be provided debt financing to Buyer in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions (the " _Financing_ ").

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter, together with the ancillary
documents referenced therein and delivered to the Members Representative,
constitute all of the agreements entered into between each of the Financing
Sources, on the one hand, and Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, with respect to the financing arrangements contemplated thereby. There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letter. As of the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of
Buyer, each of the other parties thereto (except as may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity). As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been modified or
amended in any respect and the respective commitments contained in the
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded. As of the date hereof,

Letter, nor do Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries have knowledge of any breach
of the Commitment Letter by any of the other parties thereto. As of the date
hereof, to the knowledge of Buyer, there are no facts or circumstances that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the availability of the Financing.
Buyer has timely paid in full any and all commitment fees and/or other fees
required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof under the terms of the
Commitment Letter and will pay all other commitment fees and/or other fees
required to be paid under the terms of the Commitment Letter as they become
due. Buyer acknowledges that its obligation to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions is not contingent on receipt of any financing.

 



 

5.8. _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

such time of filing and has filed any such SEC Filings prior to the expiration
of any such extension. As of their respective dates, the SEC Filings complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of the SEC Filings, when filed,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

made, not misleading. As of the date hereof, to Buyers actual knowledge, none
of the SEC Filings is the subject of any ongoing review by the SEC, nor are
there any outstanding comments from the SEC or any other Governmental
Authority to the SEC Filings. As of the date hereof, Buyer is not aware of any
events or occurrences that require Buyer to file a Current Report on Form 8-K
with the SEC (other than in connection with the Contemplated Transactions).

 



 

(b) The historical financial statements of Buyer included in the SEC Filings
(including, in each case, the notes thereto) comply in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing. Such financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, except as may be
otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes thereto and
except that unaudited financial statements may not contain all footnotes
required by GAAP, and fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the dates
thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended, subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit
adjustments.

 



      
 

 



 

5.9. _ERISA Advisory Clients_.

Other than RBC Capital Markets, LLC, neither Buyer nor or any of its

Transactions.

Fund Reorganization and all necessary actions to effect such Fund
Reorganization; and (B) the requisite approval by the shareholders of such
Patriot Registered Fund of the proposed Fund Reorganization (" _Fund
Shareholder Reorganization Approval_ "). The economic terms of the investment

investment management agreement for the corresponding Patriot Registered Fund
that will be reorganized into it. In connection therewith, Buyer shall provide
to the board of trustees

 



      
 

 



 

of the Patriot Registered Funds all information relating to such party and its
Affiliates reasonably requested by such board to enable it to evaluate the
foregoing. Further, for each such Patriot Registered Fund, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof, the approval, to the extent required to effect any
Fund Reorganization, of the board of trustees of Buyer Trust (the " _Buyer
Fund Board_ ") of the Fund Reorganization. Further, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Trust or each Buyer Fund
Series into which a Patriot Registered Fund will, pursuant to the proposed
Fund Reorganization, be reorganized to prepare and to file with the SEC,
consistent with all applicable requirements, (i) all registration statements,
including any pre-effective or post-effective amendments thereto, on Forms
N-1A and N-14 (or successor form thereto), which registration statement on
Form N-14 shall contain a joint proxy statement and prospectus (a " _Fund
Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), (ii) proxy solicitation
materials, including a form of proxy card and any supplementary proxy
materials, (iii) each Prospectus and supplement or amendment thereto, and (iv)
state "blue sky" or other regulatory filings, as may be necessary to comply in
all material respects with applicable Law, including the Securities Act,
Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Section 20 of the Investment Company Act,
and as necessary to ensure that the registration statement(s) on Form N-1A
applicable to the Buyer Fund Series has become effective upon the closing of
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall, upon the reasonable
request of Buyer, provide to Buyer any information regarding the Company or
the applicable Patriot Registered Fund that is required to be included in any
Fund Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Consistent with its
obligations under the first sentence of this Section 6.3(a), the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Patriot Registered Fund
or an agent for such Patriot Registered Fund (A) to mail such Fund
Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the shareholders of such Patriot
Registered Fund as promptly as practicable after the registration statement on
Form N-14 has become effective and no further correspondence with the Staff of
the SEC is required in connection therewith and (B) as soon as practicable
following the mailing of such proxy solicitation materials, and as permitted
by state law and the organizational documents governing the Patriot Registered
Fund, submit such Fund Reorganization for Fund Shareholder Reorganization
Approval.

 



 

(b) For each Patriot Registered Fund in respect of which the Buyer Fund Board
has failed to provide in a timely manner the approvals required of it for a
Fund Reorganization, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the due
consideration and approval by the board of trustees of the Patriot Registered
Funds (" _Fund IMA Board Approval_ ") for, in accordance with Section 15 of
the Investment Company Act (and, if applicable, Rule 15a-4 thereunder), new
Advisory Contracts with the Company with respect to each of the Patriot
Registered Funds, in each case to be in effect as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) To the extent Fund IMA Board Approval has been obtained with respect to a
new Advisory Contract relating to a Patriot Registered Fund in accordance with
Section 6.3(b), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the date of Fund IMA Board
Approval, the due consideration and approval by the shareholders of such
Patriot Registered Fund (" _Fund Shareholder IMA Approval_ ") of (1) such new
Advisory Contract in accordance with Section 15 of the Investment Company Act
and the applicable rules thereunder and (2) the election to the board of
trustees of the Patriot Registered Funds of each of the persons set out on
Section 6.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject

 



      
 

 



 

to the board composition provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
considerations and resolutions of the Nominating and Governance Committee of
the board of trustees of the Patriot Registered Funds. Further, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Patriot
Registered Fund to prepare and to file with the SEC (to the extent such filing
is required) all proxy solicitation materials necessary to comply in all
material respects with applicable Law, including Section 14 of the Exchange
Act and Section 20 of the Investment Company Act (a " _Fund Proxy Statement_
"), and Buyer shall, upon the reasonable request of the Company, provide to
the Company any information regarding Buyer that is required to be included in
any Fund Proxy Statement. Consistent with its obligations under the first
sentence of this Section 6.3(b), the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each such Patriot Registered Fund (A) to mail such Fund Proxy
Statement to the shareholders of such Patriot Registered Fund as promptly as
practicable after clearance by the SEC and (B) as soon as practicable
following the mailing of such proxy solicitation materials, submit such new
Advisory Contract for Fund Shareholder Approval.

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the
Company shall send a notice and request for consent in substantially the form
attached to this Agreement as Section 6.3(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or such other form as reasonably agreed to by the parties (the "
_Consent Notice_ ") to (i) each Separate Account Client, (ii) the investment
or financial adviser of each Advised Client (each such investment or financial
adviser, an " _Advised Client Adviser_ ") and (iii) each Fund Investor other
than holders of shares in the Patriot Registered Funds. The Company shall
request the written consent of each Separate Account Client, Advised Client
Adviser, or Fund Investor, as applicable, and the Consent Notice shall include
such request, to the assignment by the Company to Buyer Adviser of the
Advisory Contract of such Separate Account Client, Advised Client or
applicable Patriot Private Fund, and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent (each such consent, a " _Non-RIC
Account Consent_ "). The parties hereto agree that any Non-RIC Account Consent
shall be deemed obtained upon receipt of the applicable written consent from
the Separate Account Client, the Advised Client Adviser, or Requisite
Threshold of Fund Investors in the applicable Patriot Private Fund; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such consent shall be deemed to have been obtained if at
any time prior to the close of business on the Closing Measurement Date such
Separate Account Client, Advised Client Adviser, or Fund Investor (to the
extent, when taken together with other non-consenting Fund Investors, the
applicable Requisite Threshold is no longer met) terminates or affirmatively
notifies the Company that such Separate Account Client, Advised Client
Adviser, or Fund Investor has not consented or is terminating the applicable
Advisory Contract. The parties agree that the consent of any Patriot Private
Fund shall not be deemed given under this subsection (d) unless the applicable
general partner, board of directors or similar body has provided its written
consent and such consent is not withdrawn prior to Closing.

 



 

(e) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate, jointly plan, and share
information with respect to all material communications with any Advisory
Clients (including trustees of any Patriot Registered Funds or Fund Investors)
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions and the operation of the
business of the Company following the Closing. Buyer shall be provided the
opportunity to review and comment on all notices and related materials
distributed to any Advisory Client or Fund Investor by the Company in
connection with obtaining any Client Consents pursuant to this Section 6.3 at
least twenty-four (24) hours prior to their distribution.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Buyer covenants and agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Buyer specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in each Fund Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Fund
Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing of such document or any
amendments or supplements thereto, or at the time of the shareholders meeting
held in relation thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company covenants and agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in a Fund Reorganization Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or Fund Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing
of such document or any amendments or supplements thereto, or at the time of
the shareholders meeting held in relation thereto, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

6.4. _Efforts; Regulatory Filings_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and the Company shall their use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to

thereunder, Buyer and the Company shall cause to be filed with the United

(b) The Members Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and the
Company shall timely file or cause to be timely filed, all Income Tax Returns
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Periods, as well
as any other Tax Returns that reflect items that pass through to or are
liabilities of the Members (any Tax Return described in this sentence, a "
_Member-Prepared Tax Return_ "). Neither Buyer nor the Company may file or
amend any Member-Prepared Tax Return or any other Income Tax Return that
relates to or would affect a Pre-Closing Period of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as directed by the Members Representative or as required
pursuant to a final determination.

 



 

(c) Buyer, the Company and the Members shall reasonably cooperate, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, and agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, such information (including reasonable access to books and
records) and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax
Return, the conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense of
any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter. Buyer, the Company
and the Members shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any Tax audit or other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and deliver such
powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this Section 6.5(c).

 



 

(d) Any refunds of Taxes in respect of a Pre-Closing Period (including the
portion of any taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing
Date, that ends on the Closing Date) shall be for the account of the Members
and shall be paid over promptly upon receipt by Buyer or the Company, as
applicable.

 



 

6.6. _Post-Closing Investment Company Compliance_.

 



 

Each of the Company and the Members shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assure, prior to the Closing, and the parties hereto shall use
their reasonable best efforts to assure, for the three-year period following
the Closing, in each case that the composition of the board of trustees of any
Patriot Registered Fund and, if the Fund Reorganization occurs, the Buyer Fund
Board is in compliance at such times with Section 15(f)(1)(A) of the
Investment Company Act. For a period of two years after the Closing, Buyer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that there shall not
be imposed on the Patriot Registered Fund and, if the Fund Reorganization
occurs, the Buyer Fund Series an "unfair burden" (as defined in Section 15(f)
of the Investment Company Act) as a result of the Contemplated Transactions or
any terms or conditions applicable thereto. Buyer shall further use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure

 



       
 

 



 

that Buyer and its "interested persons" do not take (or fail to take), after
the Closing, any action that (or the failure of which) would have the effect,
directly or indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of the provisions
of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be met in respect of the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

6.7. _Public Announcements_.

 



 

The initial press release regarding this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions shall be made at such time and in such form as Buyer and the
Company agree. Prior to the Closing, none of Buyer, the Company or the Members
will issue or make any subsequent press release or public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions without the prior
consent of Buyer and the Company, in each case not to be unreasonably
withheld, except as may be required by Law; _provided_ , that the party
proposing to issue any press release or similar public announcement or
communication in compliance with any such disclosure obligations shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other
parties before doing so; _provided_ , _further_ , that information relating to
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transaction may be provided to Advisory
Clients in connection with the transactions contemplated by Section 6.3.

 



 

6.8. _Notice of Certain Events_.

 



 

Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly notify each other party of (a)
any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, (b) any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, (c) any Action commenced involving such party that,
if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have
been disclosed, (d) any occurrence of which it is aware that is reasonably
likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VII becoming
incapable of being satisfied, (e) notification by any senior employee of such
employees resignation of employment, (f) any material compliance violations,
and (g) the failure of such party to comply in all material respects with any
covenant or agreement to be complied with by it hereunder at or before the
Closing.

 



 

6.9. _No Negotiation_.

 



 

Each of the Company and the Members agrees that between the date of hereof and
the Closing, or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article XI, the
Company and the Members shall not, and shall cause its members and
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Affiliates and representatives not
to, directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or initiate the submission of
proposals or offers from, provide any confidential information to, or
participate in discussions or negotiations or enter into any agreement with,
any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) concerning the sale of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

6.10. _Efforts to Obtain Funding_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and

 



      
 

 



 

conditions applicable to Buyer within its control described in the Commitment
Letter in a timely manner including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with its
terms, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions (including any flex provisions set forth
in the fee letter) not less favorable, in all material respects and taken as a
whole, to Buyer, than those contained therein as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, (iii) comply with all covenants and obligations applicable to
Buyer in the Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements with respect
thereto, and (iv) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of) all
conditions applicable to Buyer in such definitive agreements (but excluding in
any event any condition where the failure to satisfy is a direct result of the
Companys failure to provide the information and assistance set forth in
Section 6.11). If at any time it becomes reasonably likely that Buyer will be
unable for any reason to consummate the Financing on the terms set forth in,
or on terms not materially less favorable to Buyer than those in, the
Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
replacement financing on terms not less favorable in all material respects and
taken as a whole, including from alternate sources, as promptly as practicable
after the occurrence of such event.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in subsection
(a) above, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives to, deliver all documents
and instruments reasonably necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letter and assist with the syndication or marketing of the
financing contemplated thereby.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify or waive
any provision in the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of
the Members Representative, if such amendment, modification or waiver (A)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing, (B) imposes additional
conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the funding of the
Financing on the Closing Date, or (C) materially adversely affects the ability
of Buyer to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. Buyer shall keep the
Company and the Members Representative reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and any replacement financing, if applicable.

 



 

6.11. _Cooperation with Financing_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide and cause its officers, employees and advisors (including
legal and accounting advisors) to provide such cooperation to Buyer as may
reasonably be requested by Buyer in connection with obtaining the Financing
necessary to complete the Contemplated Transactions, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) assist Buyer with the preparation of
pro forma financial information and pro forma financial statements to the
extent reasonably requested by Buyer or the Financing Sources, (ii) at
reasonable times and locations mutually agreed upon and upon reasonable
notice, participate in a reasonable number of road shows, meetings,
presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and similar
presentations to and with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies
including direct contact between senior management and representatives
(including legal and accounting) of the Company on the one hand, and the
financial institution(s) providing the Financing on the other hand, (iii)
facilitate the pledging of collateral

 



      
 

 



 

(conditioned on the consummation of the Closing), (iv) assist in the
preparation of customary bank books, confidential information memoranda,
lender and investor presentations, ratings agency presentations and similar
documents for the Financing, (v) provide assistance in the preparation of the
definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (vi)
assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
offering and syndication documents (including public and private information
memoranda and lender presentations), business projections and similar
marketing documents required in connection with the Financing and all
documentation and other information required for compliance with applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act, (vii) execute and deliver, in each case
effective only as of the Closing, any guarantees, pledges and security
documents, other definitive financing documents or other certificates or
documents contemplated by the Financing and hedging agreements as may
reasonably requested by Buyer (including a certificate with respect to
solvency matters as contemplated by the Financing), (viii) take such other
actions as are within their control and reasonably requested by Buyer to
facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions precedent to
obtaining the Financing, and (ix) take all actions as are within their control
and are reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate arrangements for the
discharge as of the Closing Date of any Indebtedness of the Company in the
manner contemplated in Section 2.3(h), including obtaining customary release
letters, Lien terminations and other instruments of discharge. The Company
consents to the reasonable use of the Companys logos in connection with any
Financing in a manner customary for such financing transactions, provided that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of the Companys Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)
nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall require cooperation with Buyer to
the extent it would encumber any of the assets of the Members or, prior to
Closing, the Company or its Subsidiaries, require the Members or, prior to
Closing, the Company or its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other fee or
make any other payment in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing
(unless simultaneously reimbursed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement), result in a breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time) under, the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries organizational
documents or any applicable Law or any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, in effect on the date hereof, or impose any
liability on a Member or, prior to Closing, the Company or its Subsidiaries
and (y) none of the Members, the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective directors, officers or employees, shall (A) be required to take any
action in their capacity as a member of the board of directors of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to authorize or approve the Financing, (B) have any
liability or any obligation under any debt financing agreement or any other
agreement or document related to the Financing or (C) be required to incur any
other liability in connection with the Financing, provided that clauses (B)
and (C) shall only apply to the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall promptly, upon request by the Members Representative,
reimburse the Member Indemnitees for any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable
independent accountants fees) incurred by the Member Indemnitees in
connection with the cooperation contemplated by this Section 6.11 and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Member Indemnitees from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any and all Losses
suffered or incurred in connection with Buyers use of the Companys logos
pursuant to this Section 6.11), any action

 



      
 

 



 

taken by them at the request of Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.11 and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Company and its Affiliates and Losses arising out of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Affiliates).

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that its obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein is not conditioned upon
the availability or consummation of the Financing, the availability of any
replacement commitments or receipt of the proceeds therefrom and, accordingly,
the parties hereto agree that if (i) all of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
which conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied if the Closing were
to occur), (ii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1, and (iii) the Members
irrevocably confirm in writing that the Members are prepared to consummate the
Closing and, if the Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur, a
failure of Buyer to close the Contemplated Transactions on the Closing Date in
accordance with (and subject to) the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
a result of a failure or inability to consummate the Financing constitutes a
breach of this Agreement.

 



 

6.12. _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) As long as the Closing shall not have occurred and this Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Members
Representative shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty (20) Business Days of each month end) cause to be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and delivered to Buyer unaudited consolidated balance
sheets and related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for each month ending at least twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and for the corresponding prior-year
months; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor the Members makes any
representation or warranty as to such financial statements.

 



 

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete, on or
prior to April 20, 2019, the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of, and the related consolidated statements of income,
retained earnings and cash flows for, the year ended December 31, 2018,
setting forth in comparative form the figures for (or, in the case of the
balance sheet, as of the end of) the previous fiscal year, prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (the " _2018 Audit_ ").

 



 

(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare the
September 2018 Financials, the 2018 Audit and the March 2019 Financials in
accordance with Regulation S-X.

 



 

6.13. _Restrictions on Transfer of Share Consideration_.

 



 

With respect to any issuance of Share Consideration to a Partner Member under
this Agreement, such Partner Member shall not Transfer (other than by
operation of law) any such

 



      
 

 



 

Share Consideration until the third anniversary of the Closing; _provided_
that such restriction shall cease to apply to any such Partner Member if such
Partner Member is terminated without cause; _provided_ , _further_ , that a
Partner Member shall be permitted to Transfer its Share Consideration to any
Affiliate or family member of such Partner Member in connection with estate
planning purposes.

 



 

6.14. _Excess Cash_.

 



 

The Company and the Members (other than the LPC Member) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company to have no more Closing Date Cash than
would be required for Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital to equal
Target Net Working Capital (amounts in excess of such amount " _Excess Cash_
"), including by distributing Excess Cash to the Members prior to Closing.

 



 

6.15. _Incentive Fees_.

 



 

(a) The Members shall be entitled to all payments or allocations of
performance fees, incentive fees, incentive allocations, carried interest,
contingent or similar fees and allocations paid or received by (or for the
account of) the Company or its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Affiliates
following Closing, in respect of the assets under management of Advisory
Clients for any period prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that the Members
shall not be entitled to any such payments or allocations to the extent
otherwise taken into account in calculating the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital or the Closing Date Net Working Capital. In connection
therewith, Buyer shall promptly notify the Members Representative of any and
all such payments or allocations, and shall promptly remit to the Members
Representative, for further distribution to the Members promptly, but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days following the receipt/allocation, (i)
fifteen percent (15%) of all such payments or allocations to the LPC Member
and (ii) the remainder to the other Members pro rata in accordance with each
such Members relative Indemnification Percentage; _provided_ , that, if the
Closing does not occur on the calendar year-end, then the amount of such
payments/allocations due to the Members shall be prorated based on the number
of days elapsed as of the Closing Date in such calendar year over 365 days.

 



 

6.16. _Patriot Registered Funds Boards_. Prior to Closing, the Company will
enter into a customary indemnification agreement, or purchase a tail insurance
policy (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be a Company Transaction
Expense), in favor of the board of trustees of the Patriot Registered Fund.
Such agreement or policy shall cover all claims or liability resulting from
service as a trustee of the Patriot Registered Fund and shall remain in force
for a period of six years unless agreed to otherwise by all trustees. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither an agreement nor policy in favor of the board of
trustees of the Patriot Registered Fund under this provision shall be subject
to the termination and expiration provisions of Section 10.1.

 



 

6.17. _Release of Guarantee_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) assist the Principal Employees in obtaining, effective as of the
Closing, the release of the Guarantee, dated as of November 29, 2011, by the
Principal Employees in respect of the Lease Agreement (as defined in the
Company Disclosure Schedule) and (ii) eliminate or replace the Companys
letter of credit with respect to such Lease Agreement. In the event the
release in the foregoing clause (i) is not obtained on or prior to the
Closing, the Buyer shall, promptly following the Closing, take

 



      
 

 



 

the actions set forth on Schedule 6.17. The parties hereby agree that any cash
collateral released to the Company in connection with the elimination or
replacement of such letter of credit, shall be distributed to the Members
other than the LPC Member, pro rata in accordance with their relative
Indemnification Percentages.

(b) _By the Members_. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.1 and Section
10.2(c), from and after the Closing, each of the Members (severally, as

enforcement of any of the Buyer Indemnitees indemnification rights under this
Agreement, or (vi) without duplication, any Pre-Closing Taxes.

Fundamental Representations or common law fraud), unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such claims for such matters exceeds $1,500,000, in
which event Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover Losses arising out
of or relating to such matters only to the extent in excess thereof (the "
_Deductible_ "). The Members aggregate maximum liability to Buyer Indemnitees
with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to
matters described in Section 10.2(b)(i) (other than for breaches of Company
Fundamental Representations or common law fraud, which shall be capped at the
aggregate purchase price, and for each Member, shall be capped at such
Members Indemnification Percentage of the aggregate purchase price) shall not
exceed an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the cumulative value of (x)
the total of the Closing Cash Consideration Amount and (y) Closing Shares (in
an amount equal to the value of such Closing Shares as of the Closing), which
value shall include any adjustment which may be made pursuant to Section 2.4
but shall exclude any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.5 (other than with
respect to any payments made pursuant to Section 2.5 to address a True-Up Run-
Rate Adjustment Amount) (the " _Cap_ ") in the aggregate. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, any individual indemnification claim (or, in the
case of a series of related claims, such series of related claims) involving
Losses of less than $50,000 shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 10.2(b)(i) and, to the extent applicable, shall not be counted toward
satisfaction of the Deductible (other than for breaches of Company Fundamental
Representations or common law fraud). No Losses shall be included in
determining whether the Deductible has been reached unless a notice seeking
indemnification for such Losses has been given by Buyer Indemnitees to the
Members in accordance with Sections 10.2(d)(i) and 10.2(d)(ii)(A).

 



 

(ii) Member Indemnitees shall not be entitled to any indemnification with
respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to matters
described in Section 10.2(a)(i) (other than for breaches of Buyer Fundamental
Representations or common law fraud), unless and until the aggregate amount of
all such claims for such matters exceeds the Deductible, in which event Member
Indemnitees will be entitled to recover Losses arising out of or relating to
such matters only to the extent in excess thereof. Buyers aggregate maximum
liability to Member Indemnitees with respect to any claim for indemnification
arising out of or relating to matters described in Section 10.2(a)(i) (other
than for breaches of Buyer Fundamental

 



       
 

 



 

Representations or common law fraud, which shall be capped at the aggregate
purchase price) shall not exceed the Cap in the aggregate. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, any individual indemnification claim (or, in
the case of a series of related claims, such series of related claims)
involving Losses of less than $50,000 shall not be entitled to indemnification
under Section 10.2(a)(i) and, to the extent applicable, shall not be counted
toward satisfaction of the Deductible (other than for breaches of Buyer
Fundamental Representations or common law fraud). No Losses shall be included
in determining whether the Deductible has been reached unless a notice seeking
indemnification for such Losses has been given by the Members Representative
to Buyer in accordance with Sections 10.2(d)(i) and 10.2(d)(ii)(A).

 



 

(iii) No right of indemnification hereunder shall be limited by reason of
investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing or the knowledge
of a Buyer Indemnitee of any information that would cause one or more of the
representations and warranties made by the Company or any Member to be
inaccurate, or the decision of either party to complete the Closing. The Buyer
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement to
the extent (1) the amounts related to the claims for indemnifiable Losses of
the Buyer Indemnitees were specifically included and fully taken into account
(with a specific reference to the matter described) in the Financial
Statements or the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, or Closing Date Indebtedness as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4, or (2) that would otherwise result
in double recovery for any such indemnifiable Losses.

 



 

(iv) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover any Losses relating
to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement (the " _Subject
Provision_ ") to the extent that such Indemnified Party has already recovered
or claimed Losses with respect to such matter pursuant to another provision of
this Agreement and recovery under such Subject Provision would result in a
duplication of recovery with respect to such matter.

 



 

(v) Each party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Losses with respect to which it may be entitled to seek indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(vi) Subject to Section 10.2(f)(i), in connection with any obligation for
indemnification arising out of or relating to matters described in Section
10.2(b) (other than with respect to Sections 10.2(b)(i) to the extent relating
to a breach of any representation or warranty made by such Member and
10.2(b)(ii)), each Member shall only be severally liable for his, her or its
Indemnification Percentage of any such obligation (individually or in the
aggregate) and the Buyer will (in the case of any Member whose Class A Units
represent less than two percent (2%) of the outstanding equity interests in
the Company, to the extent reasonably practicable), pursue each such claim or
indemnification hereunder against each Member in substantially the same
manner; _provided_ , that with respect to a breach of a representation or
warranty contained in Article IV or a covenant or agreement by any individual
Member hereunder (with each such individual Member breach referred to herein
as an " _Individual Member Breach_ "), only such particular Member shall have
an obligation for indemnification arising out of or relating to such
Individual Member Breach, and the parties agree that no other Member shall be
liable hereunder for any such Individual Member Breach.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Procedure_.

 



 

(i) _Direct Claims_. If either a Buyer Indemnitee, on the one hand, or a
Member Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall have a claim for indemnification
hereunder (the " _Indemnitee_ ") for any claim other than a claim asserted by
a third party, the Indemnitee shall, as promptly as is practicable, give
written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnitor_ ") of the nature and, to the extent practicable, a good faith
estimate of the amount, of the claim. The failure to make prompt delivery of
such written notice by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor (so long as a notice
pursuant to this Section 10.2(d)(i) is given before the expiration of the
applicable period set forth in Section 10.1) shall not relieve the Indemnitor
from any liability under this Section 10.2 with respect to such matter, except
to the extent the Indemnitor is actually materially prejudiced by failure to
give such notice.

 



 

(ii) _Third-Party Actions_.

 



 

(A) If an Indemnitee receives notice or otherwise obtains knowledge of any
matter or any threatened matter that may give rise to an indemnification claim
against the Indemnitor (the " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnitee
shall promptly deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice describing, to the
extent practicable, such matter in reasonable detail. The failure to make
prompt delivery of such written notice (so long as a notice pursuant to this
Section 10.2(d)(ii)(A) that includes any written notice of the third party
claimant is given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in
Section 10.1) shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability under this
Section 10.2 with respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnitor
is actually materially prejudiced by failure to give such notice. The
Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnitor copies of all other notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the
Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor, by notice to the Indemnitee within ten (10)
days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, shall have the right,
at its option and expense, to assume the defense of any such matter with its
own counsel, provided that the Indemnitor shall allow the Indemnitee a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel and at its own expense.

 



 

(B) If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of and indemnification for
any such matter, then:

 



 

(1) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Indemnitor shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the Indemnitee
against any attorneys fees or other expenses incurred on behalf of the
Indemnitee in connection with such matter following the Indemnitors election
to assume the defense of such matter, unless the Indemnitor fails to defend
diligently the action or proceeding within ten (10) days after receiving
notice of such failure from the Indemnitee;

 



 

(2) each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to
reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim,
and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith; and

 



      
 

 



 

(3) the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnitee,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle or compromise any
pending or threatened Action in respect of which indemnification may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to
such Action) or consent to the entry of any judgment which (i) does not, to
the extent that the Indemnitee may have any liability with respect to such
Action, include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant
or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a written release of the Indemnitee from all
liability in respect of such Action, (ii) imposes injunctive or other
equitable relief on the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) involves
a finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnitee or
any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(C) If the Indemnitor elects not to assume the defense of and indemnification
for such matter, then the Indemnitee shall defend such matter with the
assistance of counsel selected by the Indemnitee; _provided_ , that the
Indemnitee shall not settle, adjust or compromise such matter, or admit any
liability with respect to such matter, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

(D) The procedures in this Section 10.2(d)(ii) shall not apply to direct
claims of Member Indemnitees or Buyer Indemnitees.

 



 

(e) _Exclusive Remedies Following the Closing Date_. Following the Closing,
except with respect to claims for common law fraud, the indemnification
provisions of this Section 10.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
monetary damages of Buyer Indemnitees and Member Indemnitees, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, for all matters arising under or in connection
with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including, without
limitation, for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth herein.

 



 

(f) _Indemnity Escrow Fund; Offset_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Buyer Indemnitees hereby agree that (x) any amount payable to the Buyer
Indemnitees in respect of any Loss recoverable pursuant to this Article X
shall (1) when finally determined, be satisfied first from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and (2) second be offset against any amount otherwise payable by
Buyer to the Members under this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.5 and (y) any
amounts offset by Buyer pursuant to this Section 10.2(f) (to the extent the
indemnification obligation arose from the breach of any representations or
warranties or covenants of the Company set forth in this Agreement), shall be
offset, severally but not jointly, on a ratable basis against each of the
Members in accordance with their respective Indemnification Percentages. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnity Escrow Fund and such offset from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be the sole source of recovery for Losses
recoverable by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this Article X (other than
for breaches of covenants hereunder, Company Fundamental Representations or
common law fraud). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Members
Representative obtains a non-appealable judgment that any amounts offset by
Buyer should be paid instead to the Members, or the Members Representative
and Buyer agree to resolve any

 



      
 

 



 

pending claim by Buyer which results in any amounts previously set off by
Buyer instead being paid to the Members, any amounts so offset shall be
promptly paid (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of such
determination) to the Members in accordance with their respective
Indemnification Percentages, _plus_ accrued interest on such amounts,
compounded annually, from the date such amounts would have otherwise been
payable to the Members but for the operation of this Section 10.2(f) at the
same interest rate then borne by Buyers term debt under its credit facility;
_provided_ , that, if there is a default by Buyer of the repayment obligation
in the preceding sentence, then, without limiting any of the Members remedies
herein, the applicable interest rate shall be the same interest rate as market
unsecured borrowing rates.

 



 

(ii) On the date which is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "
_Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date_ "), Buyer and the Members
Representative shall deliver a joint written notice instructing the Escrow
Agent to release to the Members Representative:

 



 

(A) an amount from the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to the amount, if any, by
which one third (1/3) of the initial cash portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund
exceeds the sum of (x) all cash amounts paid to Buyer from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund prior to the Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date _plus_ (y)
eighty five percent (85%) of the Claimed Indemnification Amount; and

 



 

(B) a number of shares of Class B Common Stock from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
equal to the amount, if any, by which one third (1/3) of the initial share
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund exceeds the sum of (x) all shares
delivered to Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Fund prior to the Initial
Indemnity Escrow Release Date _plus_ (y) the number of shares that is fifteen
percent (15%) of (I) the Claimed Indemnification Amount divided by (II) the
twenty (20) day Average VWAP on the Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date, for
disbursement to each Member in accordance with such Members Indemnification
Percentage.

 



 

(iii) On the date which is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the "
_Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date_ "), Buyer and the Members
Representative shall deliver a joint written notice instructing the Escrow
Agent to release to the Members Representative:

 



 

(A) an amount from the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to the amount, if any, by
which the remaining cash portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund exceeds eighty
five percent (85%) of the Claimed Indemnification Amount; and

 



 

(B) a number of shares of Class B Common Stock from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
equal to (x) the amount, if any, by which (i) the remaining share portion of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund multiplied by the twenty (20) day Average VWAP on
such date, exceeds (ii) fifteen percent (15%) of the Claimed Indemnification
Amount, divided (y) such twenty (20) day Average VWAP, for disbursement to
each Member in accordance with such Members Indemnification Percentage.

 



 

Promptly following resolution of all claims for indemnification that were
pending as of the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date pursuant to a notice of
claim which had been timely delivered in accordance with Section 10.2(d),
Buyer and the Members Representative shall deliver a joint

 



      
 

 



 

written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Indemnity Escrow
Fund remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, to the Members
Representative for disbursement to each Member in accordance with such
Members Indemnification Percentage.

 



 

(g) _Materiality_. In all cases in determining whether there has been a breach
of a representation or warranty or calculating the amount of any Loss with
respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein, such
representations and warranties shall be read without regard to any materiality
qualifier (including reference to Company Material Adverse Effect or Buyer
Material Adverse Effect) contained therein, except with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.6, 3.7, 5.8(b) and 5.12
or any references to "Material Contracts".

 



 

(h) _Tax Treatment_. For Tax purposes, the parties shall treat any payment
made pursuant to Article X as an adjustment to the purchase price for income
Tax purposes, except to the extent required by Section 483 or 1274 of the
Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a final determination within the
meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, or any analogous provision of applicable
state, local or non-U.S. law.

 



 

ARTICLE XI _ 
Termination_

 



 

11.1. _Termination_.

 



 

This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing and the Contemplated
Transactions may be abandoned:

 



 

(a) at any time, by mutual written agreement of the Members Representative
and Buyer; or

 



 

(b) at any time, by either the Members Representative or Buyer if any
Restraint having any of the effects set forth in Section 7.1(a) of this
Agreement shall be in effect and have become final and non-appealable; or

 



 

(c) by written notice from Buyer, if a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Members or
the Company set forth herein shall have occurred, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Sections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), and (ii) after receipt by the Members
Representative of written notice from Buyer of such breach or failure to
perform, cannot be cured on or prior to June 11, 2019 (the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ , that Buyer is not then in material breach with respect to any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement; or

 



 

(d) by written notice from the Members Representative, if a breach of or
failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of Buyer set forth herein shall have occurred, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b), and (ii) after receipt by Buyer of written notice
from the Members Representative of such breach or failure to perform, cannot
be cured on or prior to the End Date; _provided_ that the Members and the
Company are not then in material breach

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(e) by written notice by either the Members Representative or Buyer to the
other party, at any time after the End Date if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or prior to such date; _provided_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 11.1(e) shall not be available to such party
if the action or inaction of the Members, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, or Buyer of any of its Affiliates, as applicable, has
been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach
of this Agreement.

 



 

11.2. _Procedure and Effect of Termination_.

 



 

In the event of the termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Contemplated Transactions, written notice thereof shall be given by the
Members Representative to Buyer or by Buyer to the Members Representative,
as applicable, and this Agreement shall terminate and the Contemplated
Transactions shall be abandoned without further action by any of the parties.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, no party hereto
shall have any obligation or liability to the other parties hereto, except
that the parties hereto shall remain bound by the provisions of this Section
11.2, and Section 6.7 (Public Announcements) and Article XII and by the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other hand, shall share equally in any Consent Expenses or
filing fees pursuant to the HSR Act incurred as of the time of such
termination; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall relieve a
defaulting or breaching party from any liability or damages arising out of its
intentional and material breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement
prior to such termination; _provided_ , _further_ , without limitation of the
foregoing or the remedies of the non-defaulting or non-breaching party, the
defaulting or breaching party shall be liable for 100% of any Consent Expenses
or filing fees pursuant to the HSR Act incurred as of the time of such
termination.

 



 

ARTICLE XII _ 
Miscellaneous_

 



 

12.1. _Members  Representative_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment of Members  Representative_. Each of the Members hereby
constitutes and irrevocably appoints, effective from and after the date
hereof, the Members Representative as such Members sole and exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact to act as Members Representative under this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Section 12.1. In the event of the
dissolution, resignation, death or incapacity of any Person comprising the
Members Representative, a successor reasonably satisfactory to Buyer shall
thereafter be appointed by an instrument in writing signed by such successor
and by those Members who, immediately prior to the date hereof, held a
majority of the outstanding Class A Units held by all Members, and such
appointment shall become effective as to any such successor when a copy of
such instrument shall have been delivered to Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Authority_. The Members Representative is hereby authorized and
empowered to act exclusively for, and on behalf of, any or all of the Members
(with full power of substitution in the premises) in connection with (i) the
indemnity provisions of Article X as they relate to the Members generally,
(ii) the provisions of Article II, including the Closing Consideration
Adjustment and (iii) such other matters as are reasonably necessary for the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions including, without limitation,
(A) to receive all payments owing to the Members after the Closing under this
Agreement, (B) to terminate, amend, waive any provision of, or abandon, this
Agreement, (C) to act as the representative of the Members to review and
authorize all claims and disputes or question the accuracy thereof, (D) to
negotiate and compromise on their behalf with Buyer any claims asserted
thereunder and to authorize payments to be made with respect thereto, (E) to
take such further actions as are authorized in this Agreement, and (F) in
general, do all things and perform all acts, including, without limitation,
executing and delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, consents,
elections, instructions and other documents contemplated by or deemed by the
Members Representative to be necessary or desirable in connection with this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. Buyer shall be entitled to rely
on such appointment and to treat the Members Representative as the duly
appointed attorney-in-fact of each Member. For the avoidance of doubt, no
claims under this Agreement may be asserted and no Actions brought by any of
the Members in their individual capacity as any claims should be asserted, and
any Actions brought, by the Members Representative. The Members shall
cooperate with the Members Representative and any accountants, attorneys or
other agents whom it may retain to assist in carrying out its duties
hereunder. Each Member by execution of this Agreement, and without any further
action, confirms such appointment and authority. Notices given to the Members
Representative in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall
constitute notice to the Members for all purposes under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Extent and Survival of Authority_. The appointment of the Members
Representative is an agency coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and
any action taken by the Members Representative pursuant to the authority
granted in this Section 12.1 shall be effective and absolutely binding on each
Member notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such Member,
except for actions or omissions of the Members Representative constituting
willful misconduct or gross negligence. The death or incapacity, or
dissolution or other termination of existence, of any Member shall not
terminate the authority and agency of the Members Representative. Buyer in
dealing with the Members Representative may conclusively and absolutely rely,
without inquiry, upon any act of the Members Representative as the act of the
Member, all of which actions shall be final and binding upon the Members and
Buyer shall not have any liability for any Losses incurred by the Members
Representative or any actions taken or omitted to be taken in accordance with
or in reliance upon actions of the Members Representative, including in
respect of the release or distribution of any amounts from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund or the Adjustment Escrow Fund.

 



 

(d) _Release from Liability; Indemnification_. Each Member hereby releases
each Person comprising the Members Representative from, and each Member
agrees to indemnify each Person comprising the Members Representative
against, liability for any action taken or not taken by such Person in his or
its capacity as such (including the expenses referred to in Sections 2.4(e)
and 12.1(e) hereof), except for the liability of such Person to a Member for
loss which such Member may suffer from the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of such Person in carrying

 



      
 

 



 

out his or its duties hereunder. No Person comprising the Members
Representative shall be liable to any Member or to any other Person (other
than Buyer), with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Members Representative in his or its role as Members Representative under or
in connection with this Agreement, unless such action or omission results from
or arises out of willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the
Members Representative, and no Person comprising the Members Representative
shall be liable to any Member in the event that, in the exercise of his or its
reasonable judgment, such Person believes there will not be adequate resources
available to cover potential costs and expenses to contest a claim made by
Buyer against the Members.

 



 

(e) _Reimbursement of Expenses_. The Members Representative shall receive no
compensation for service as such but each Person comprising the Members
Representative shall receive reimbursement from the Members pro rata in
accordance with their respective Indemnification Percentage for any and all
expenses, charges and liabilities, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys fees, incurred by the Persons comprising the Members
Representative in the performance or discharge of their duties pursuant to
this Section 12.1.

 



 

12.2. _Expenses_.

 



 

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Contemplated Transactions
are consummated; _provided_ , that except as otherwise specifically set forth
herein, all fees and expenses incurred by the Company prior to the Closing
shall be borne by the Members.

 



 

12.3. _Notices_.

 



 

All notices and other communications given or made pursuant hereto shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made (a) as of the date
delivered, if delivered personally, (b) on the date the delivering party
receives confirmation, if delivered by electronic mail, so long as a receipt
of such electronic mail is requested and received, (c) three (3) Business Days
after being mailed by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return
receipt requested) or (d) one (1) Business Day after being sent by overnight
courier (providing proof of delivery), to the parties at the following
addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified in a
notice given in accordance with this Section 12.3):

12.4. _Governing Law_.

 



 

This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws (excluding conflict of laws rules and principles) of
the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed
entirely within such state, including all matters of construction, validity
and performance.

 



 

12.5. _Entire Agreement_.

 



 

This Agreement, together with the Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Ancillary Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior contracts or agreements, whether
oral or written.

 



 

12.6. _Severability_.

 



 

Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
Person or circumstance be held invalid or unenforceable to any extent: (a)
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, and only to the extent, of
such unenforceability or prohibition and shall be enforced to the greatest
extent permitted by Law, (b) such unenforceability or prohibition in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision as
applied (i) to other Persons or circumstances or (ii) in any other
jurisdiction, and (c) such unenforceability or prohibition shall not affect or
invalidate any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

12.7. _Amendment_.

 



 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended,
supplemented or modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed
by Buyer and the Members Representative; _provided_ that the observance of
any provision of this Agreement may be waived in writing by the party, and in
the case of the Members, by the Members Representative, that will lose the
benefit of such provision as a result of such waiver. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, Sections 12.4, 12.7, 12.9, 12.12, 12.14 and
12.18 may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
adversely affects in any respect the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of such Financing Source.

 



       
 

 



 

12.8. _Effect of Waiver or Consent_.

 



 

No waiver or consent, express or implied, by any party to or of any breach or
default by any party in the performance by such party of its obligations
hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any
other breach or default in the performance by such party of the same or any
other obligations of such party hereunder. No single or partial exercise of
any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. Failure on the part of a party to
complain of any act of any party or to declare any party in default,
irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver
by such party of its rights hereunder until the applicable statute of
limitation period has run.

 



 

12.9. _Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others_.

 



 

The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors
and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be
construed to give any Person (other than the parties hereto and their
respective legal representatives, successors and assigns and as expressly
provided herein) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or provisions contained
herein, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise (it being agreed that (a)
each of the Financing Sources is an express third party beneficiary of, and
shall be entitled to rely on and enforce, Sections 12.4, 12.7, 12.9, 12.12,
12.14, and 12.18 of this Agreement, and (b) each of the Patriot Funds is an
express third party beneficiary of, and shall be entitled to rely and enforce,
Section 12.17 of this Agreement).

 



 

12.10. _Assignability_.

 



 

This Agreement shall not be assigned by the Company prior to the Closing or
any Member at any time without the prior written consent of Buyer. This
Agreement shall not be assigned by the Company following the Closing or Buyer
at any time without the prior written consent of the Members Representative;
provided the Company and/or Buyer may assign or delegate its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to any one of its Affiliates or to any
Financing Sources pursuant to the terms of the Financing, including for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning this
Agreement as collateral in respect of such Financing, without the consent of
any other party hereto. Any purported assignment in contravention of the
foregoing shall be for all purposes null and void.

 



 

12.11. _Disclosure Schedules_.

 



 

The information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule is disclosed
solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set forth
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third
party of any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach of
any Contract. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the information and
disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Members, the Company and
Buyer, respectively, contained in this Agreement. Nothing in the Company
Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or create any covenant. Matters reflected

 



      
 

 



 

in the Company Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters
required by the Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

 



 

12.12. _Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

Any Action against any party to this Agreement arising out of or in any way
relating to this Agreement shall be brought in any federal or state court
located in the State of New York in New York County and each of the parties
hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of
any such Action; _provided_ , that a final non-appealable judgment in any such
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. **The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that (i) any dispute as to whether a termination of a
Principal Employees employment was a Permissible Termination or a resignation
for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Employment Documentation),
in each case, prior to the expiration of the Third Earnout Period, shall be
resolved in single action pursuant to this Section 12.12 and that, in the
event that such action is initiated by or against either the Members
Representative under this Agreement or the applicable Principal Employee under
the Employment Documentation, the other of the Members Representative or such
Principal Employee shall be provided with notice of such action and afforded
an opportunity to join such action and (ii) any final non-appealable judgment
in accordance with this Section 12.12 (or any binding settlement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement) regarding whether a termination of a
Principal Employee was a Permissible Termination or a resignation for Good
Reason pursuant to the Employment Documentation, whether initiated by or
against the applicable Principal Employee under such Principal Employees
Employment Documentation or by or against the Members Representative under
this Agreement, shall be final, non-appealable and binding on all parties for
all purposes of this Agreement and the Employment Documentation. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (a) any objection which
it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such Action in any federal or
state court located in the State of New York in New York County, (b) any claim
that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and (c) any claim that such court does not have
jurisdiction with respect to such Action.** To the extent that service of
process by mail is permitted by applicable Law, each party irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any such Action in such courts by the
mailing of such process by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at
its address for notices provided for herein. **Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right to a trial by jury and agrees that any of
them may file a copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of
the knowing, voluntary and bargained-for agreement among the parties
irrevocably to waive its right to trial by jury in any Action.**

 



 

12.13. _No Other Duties_.

 



 

The only duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement are as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations
shall be implied in fact, Law or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary
obligation.

 



      
 

 



 

12.14. _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties
agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to
seek equitable relief. Each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Members
shall be entitled to specific performance of Buyers obligation to pay the
Closing Cash Consideration Amount and the Closing Shares only if (i) all of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, but which conditions are, at the time that the Members seek
specific performance pursuant to this Section 12.14(b), reasonably capable of
being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time), (ii) Buyer fails
to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.1, and (iii) the Members irrevocably confirm in writing
that the Members are prepared to consummate the Closing and, if specific
performance is granted, then the Closing will occur.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Company, the Members or their respective Affiliates be
entitled to, or permitted to seek, specific performance in respect of any
Financing Source under the terms of this Agreement, and nor shall there be any
right of the Company, the Members or their respective Affiliates, or any
obligation of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to enforce specifically any
of the Buyers and its Affiliates respective rights under the Commitment
Letter or any other agreements relating to the financings contemplated
thereby.

 



 

12.15. _Counterparts_.

 



 

This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or PDF signatures and in any
number of counterparts with the same effect as if all signatory parties had
signed the same document. All counterparts shall be construed together and
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

12.16. _Further Assurance_.

 



 

If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable
to fully effect the Contemplated Transactions, each of the parties shall take
such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may request.

 



 

12.17. _No Recourse_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith, each of the parties (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be made
against, the parties to this Agreement, and no Affiliate of Buyer that is not
a party to this Agreement, shall

 



      
 

 



 

have any obligation hereunder or in connection herewith or any liability for
any obligation of any of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim based
upon, arising out of or relating to the Contemplated Transactions, whether by
enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty, by any legal or equitable
action, suit or proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the parties
hereto, each on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or
agents, hereby (i) acknowledge that none of the Patriot Funds or the directors
or trustees thereof shall have any liability under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Contemplated Transactions,
(ii) waive any rights or claims against any of the Patriot Funds or the
directors or trustees thereof in connection with this Agreement, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (iii) agree not to
commence (and if commenced agree to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not to
assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,
petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any Patriot Fund or
the directors or trustees thereof in connection with this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

12.18. _Financing Sources_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company and the
Members, each on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or
agents (the foregoing, collectively the " _Company Related Parties_ "), hereby
(a) acknowledge that none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability
under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the Contemplated Transactions, including, but not limited to, any dispute
related to, or arising from, the Financing, the Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof, (b) waive any rights or claims against any of the
Financing Sources in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the
Commitment Letter, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and (c) agree not to commence (and if commenced agree to dismiss or
otherwise terminate, and not to assist) any action, arbitration, audit,
hearing, investigation, litigation, petition, grievance, complaint, suit or
proceeding against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing, the Commitment Letter or the Contemplated Transactions. With
respect to any dispute or proceeding relating to the Financing Sources and
this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
or the performance thereof, the Company and the Members, on behalf of
themselves and the other Company Related Parties, (i) submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York or federal courts of the
United States of America, in each case, sitting in the Borough of Manhattan,
and any appellate court from any thereof (the courts described in this clause
(i), the " _Applicable Courts_ "), and agree that all claims in respect of any
such litigation may be heard and determined only in the Applicable Courts,
(ii) waive, to the fullest extent it may legally do so, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any proceeding in any
Applicable Court, (iii) waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such proceeding in any
Applicable Court, (iv) irrevocably and unconditionally waive any right to a
trial by jury, and (v) agree that a final judgment in any such proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit in on
the judgment or any other manner provided by law.

 



      
 

 



 

12.19. _Legal Representation_.

 



 

In any dispute or claim arising under or in connection with this Agreement,
including under Section 10.2, the Members shall have the right, at their
election, to retain the firm of Seward and Kissel LLP to represent them in such
matter. Buyer and, following the Closing, the Company, for themselves and for
their respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waive any
objection and consent to any such representation in any such matter. Buyer,
for itself, the Company, and Buyers successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the
Company, the Members and their counsel made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and Closing under, or after the
Closing between the Members and such counsel in connection with any dispute or
claim arising under or in connection with, this Agreement, or any matter
relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged communications, such
privilege belongs solely to the Members, and none of Buyer, the Company or any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer or the Company, will
seek to obtain the same by any process. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that a dispute
arises between Buyer or any of the Company or its Subsidiaries and a third
party other than a Member after the Closing, the Company or its Subsidiaries
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Seward and Kissel LLP to such third party.
