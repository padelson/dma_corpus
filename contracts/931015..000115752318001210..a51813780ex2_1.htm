good faith to mutually agree upon the Estimated Closing Statement in the event

liability to the Company Member or to any other Person for the calculation or
allocation of any item or amount set forth therein.

  

  

Section 2.4. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_ _._

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within ninety (90) days after

a statement (the " _Buyer 's Statement_") setting forth in reasonable detail
its calculation of (i) the Closing Net Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Cash,

11  

  

  

(b) After delivery of the Buyer's Statement, Buyer shall give the Holder
Representative reasonable access, at reasonable times and upon reasonable
advance notice, to review the work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents prepared or reviewed by Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Company and
their respective Representatives in connection with the preparation of the
Buyer's Statement and Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Company shall cause
their respective Representatives to reasonably cooperate with and respond to
such inquiries and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Holder
Representative in the review of the Buyer's Statement, including by providing
reasonable access to the books and records of the Surviving Company in
connection therewith, _provided_ _however_ , that the independent accountants
of Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to the Holder Representative unless and until the
Holder Representative has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants; _provided_ , _further_
, that any such access shall be subject to such additional limitations as
Parent may reasonably require to prevent material disruption of the business
of Parent or the Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries, the
disclosure of any confidential or legally privileged information, or the
disclosure or use of any personal information other than in compliance with
applicable privacy or data protection Laws. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts not to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Company) to use commercially reasonable efforts not to, take any
action to limit the Holder Representative's access to the books and records
of, and the current and former personnel and advisors of, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries in a manner that would frustrate the purposes of
this _Section 2.4_.

  

  

(c) Within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Buyer's Statement to the
Holder Representative, the Holder Representative will advise Buyer in writing
whether it agrees with the Buyer's Statement or whether the Holder
Representative objects to it. If the Holder Representative disputes any
amounts reflected on the Buyer's Statement, it shall deliver to Buyer a
statement setting forth its objections thereto, setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute, the dollar amounts involved and the Holder
Representative's calculation of the Buyer's Statement, within forty-five (45)
days of Buyer's delivery of the Buyer's Statement to the Holder Representative
(such written notice of objection, the " _Objection Statement_ "). If an
Objection Statement is not delivered to Parent within forty-five (45) days
after delivery of the Buyer's Statement to the Holder Representative, the
Buyer's Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties
hereto absent fraud or manifest error. The Holder Representative and Parent
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections made by the Holder
Representative in the Objection Statement, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objection
Statement, either the Holder Representative or Parent may submit the issues in
the Objection Statement that remain in dispute for final resolution to
PricewaterhouseCoopers or if such firm is unable to serve, to an independent
certified public accounting firm of national reputation mutually agreed by the
Holder Representative and Parent (the firm so determined, the " _Independent
Accountant_ "). Each Party agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent
Accountant, a reasonable and customary engagement letter, including customary
indemnities. The Independent Accountant shall consider only those items and
amounts in the Objection Statement which Parent and the Holder Representative
are unable to resolve and only on the basis that (i) an amount reflected in
the Buyer's Statement does not reflect, or has not been made in a manner
consistent with, the provisions of this Agreement and (ii) an amount reflected
in the Buyer's Statement (if different from an amount reflected in the balance
sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2018 included in the Financial
Statements) is based on facts or occurrences arising solely between March 31,
2018 and the Adjustment Time. In resolving any item of dispute, the
Independent Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Parent and the Holder
Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Parent or the Holder Representative. Parent and the Holder Representative
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to resolve all disagreements in the Objection Statement as soon as
practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after the submission of
any dispute to the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall
make its determination (x) based solely on the documentation submitted by, and
presentations made by, Parent and Holder Representative (any such
documentation or presentation must be provided to the other party prior to its
submission or presentation to the Independent Accountant) and (y) in a manner
consistent with the Accounting Principles and the Net Working Capital
Calculation and the definitions of Estimated Purchase Price, Final Purchase
Price and Net Working Capital (and each of the defined terms used in each of
those terms or in which those terms are used and the related provisions of
this Agreement). The resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accountant
shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto absent fraud
or manifest error. The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall
be borne by Parent and the Holder Representative (solely on behalf of the
Company Members) based on the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to such Party bears to the amount actually contested by
such Party, as finally determined by the Independent Accountant. During the
review by the Independent Accountant, the Holder Representative and Parent
shall each make available to the Independent Accountant such party's current
and former personnel and such information, books, records and work papers, as
may be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.4_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
independent accountants of the Holder Representative or Parent shall not be
obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent Accountant
unless and until the Independent Accountant has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants.

(d) Promptly following the determination of the Final Purchase Price, and in
any event within five (5) Business Days thereof, the Holder Representative
shall deliver to Buyer the Updated Distribution Waterfall.

  

  

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
no later than five (5) Business Days after the Final Purchase Price has been

Paying Agent an amount equal to the excess of (i) the Final Purchase Price
_minus_ (ii) the Estimated Purchase Price for payment of the Purchase Price
Increase Per Interest Payment owed, with respect to all Company Membership
Interests, to the former Company Members.

  

  

The Paying Agent shall promptly disburse the funds received pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(e)_ to the former Company Members in accordance with the Updated
Distribution Waterfall and in accordance with this _Article II_.

  

  

(f) If the Final Purchase Price is less than or equal to the Estimated
Purchase Price, Buyer shall reduce any Deferred Payment Amount (subject to
_Section 8.4_ ) dollar-for-dollar in an aggregate amount equal to the
Estimated Purchase Price _minus_ the Final Purchase Price, which reduction
shall be Parent's sole and exclusive remedy with respect thereto.

  

 

13  

  

  

Section 2.5. _Deferred Payments_ _._

  

  

(a) On or prior to each anniversary of the Closing Date beginning on and
including the first anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on and
including the twelfth anniversary of the Closing Date, or in each case, if
such date is not a Business Day, the first Business Day following such date
(each, a " _Deferred Payment Date_ "), Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause
Buyer to) deposit, or cause the Surviving Company to deposit, with the Paying
Agent an amount equal to the Deferred Payment Amount. The Parties and the
Holder Representative shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly disburse, on or
promptly following each such Deferred Payment Date, the Deferred Per Interest
Payment Amount owed with respect to all Company Membership Interests to the
former Company Members in accordance with the Updated Distribution Waterfall
and in accordance with this _Article II_ , as such amount may be reduced
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ or _Article VIII_. The " _Deferred Payment Amount_ "
means $8,333,333.

  

  

(b) In the event of the occurrence of any of the following events, any
Deferred Payment Amounts that have not been paid shall be immediately due and
payable into an escrow account to be established at such time with an escrow
agent reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Holder Representative, and
Parent and the Holder Representative shall enter into an escrow agreement with
such escrow agent on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Holder
Representative, which escrow agreement shall provide that the escrow agent
shall not release funds deposited in such escrow account other than upon joint
instruction from Parent and the Holder Representative or upon an order of a
court of competent jurisdiction (such amount deposited in such escrow account,
the " _Deferred Payment Escrow Amount_ "): (1) Parent, Buyer or the Surviving
Company commences any proceeding in bankruptcy or for dissolution,
liquidation, winding-up, or other relief under state or federal bankruptcy
laws, (2) any such proceeding is commenced against Parent, Buyer or the
Surviving Company, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for Parent, Buyer or
the Surviving Company or a substantial part of its respective property, and
such proceeding or appointment is not dismissed or discharged within one
hundred and twenty (120) days after its commencement, (3) Parent, Buyer or the
Surviving Company makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or
petitions or applies to any tribunal for the appointment of a custodian,
receiver or trustee for all or substantially all of its assets or has a
receiver, custodian or trustee appointed for all or substantially all of its
assets, (4) any attempted assignment of Buyer's and/or Parent's obligations
under this _Section 2.5_ without the prior written consent of the Holder
Representative, other than to an acquiror of all or substantially all of the
assets of the business of the Surviving Company, (5) any default in any
payment obligation with respect to any Indebtedness of Parent, Buyer or the
Surviving Company in a principal amount exceeding $100,000,000, and such
default shall continue after the applicable grace period and shall result in
the acceleration of such Indebtedness, (6) the failure of Parent or Buyer to
make a payment required by _Section 2.5(a)_ when such payment shall become due
and payable, which failure has not been cured within thirty (30) days of the
receipt by Parent of written notice thereof from the Holder Representative.
Following an event described in clauses (1) through (6) of the previous
sentence, the Deferred Payment Escrow Amount shall remain subject to reduction
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ or _Article VIII_ , and any remainder of such amount
shall be due and payable from such escrow account to the Paying Agent ratably
on each Deferred Payment Date in such amounts as set forth in _Section
2.5(a),_ to be disbursed to the former Company Members in accordance with the
Updated Distribution Waterfall as set forth in _Section 2.5(a)_ , and on or
prior to each Deferred Payment Date, Parent and the Holder Representative
shall jointly instruct the escrow agent to make such payment on such Deferred
Payment Date in accordance with this Agreement.

  

 

14  

  

  

(c) Except as may be prohibited by applicable Law, all of the Holder
Representative's rights and remedies on behalf of the former Company Members
with respect to any Deferred Payment Amounts shall be cumulative and may be
exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by the Holder Representative to
pursue (or not to pursue) any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other
remedy. If any Deferred Payment Amount is disputed, collected or enforced
through an attorney, by lawsuit, or through probate, bankruptcy or other
Proceeding, then all costs of such dispute, collection and enforcement,
including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by the
prevailing party in such dispute shall be borne by the other party, and any
such costs recovered by the Holder Representative pursuant to this sentence
shall be due and owing to the former Company Members in addition to other
amounts due. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Holder Representative
will be deemed to prevail if any recovery is made by the Holder Representative
with respect to such dispute and Parent will be deemed to prevail if no
recovery is made by the Holder Representative with respect to such dispute.

  

  

Section 2.6. _Paying Agent and Letter of Transmittals_ _._

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer and the Holder Representative shall
enter into a paying agent agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "), in a
form reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Holder Representative, with a
paying agent reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Holder Representative (the
" _Paying Agent_ "). Any funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall be held
in a non-interest bearing account or in an account in which the Paying Agent
may undertake in investments with the funds thereof as mutually agreed by the
Paying Agent, Buyer, the Company and the Holder Representative (the " _Payment
Fund_ ") and used to satisfy the payments required to be made to the former
holders of Company Membership Interests in accordance with this _Article II_.
If for any reason the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient
(including because of investment loss) to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made pursuant to this _Article II_ , Buyer shall promptly
deposit into the Payment Fund the amount of cash required to fully satisfy
such cash payment obligations. Except as provided for in this Agreement, the
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Paying
Agent shall deliver to each Company Member a letter of transmittal in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), to be completed and delivered by each such Company Member to
effect (subject to the occurrence of the Closing) the exchange of such Company
Member's Company Membership Interests (including the surrender of any
certificates evidencing such Company Membership Interests, to the extent
applicable) for the payment of the applicable Estimated Per Interest Payment
Amount for each Company Membership Interest surrendered thereby, without any
interest thereon. Upon completion and delivery of a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the Company Member shall be entitled, following the Effective
Time, to receive in exchange for each Company Membership Interest surrendered
thereby, an amount equal to the applicable Estimated Per Interest Payment
Amount with respect to such Company Membership Interest, subject to and in
accordance with the Distribution Waterfall. With respect to any Company Member
that delivers a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal (and
properly surrenders any certificates, if applicable) at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Parties shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, cause the Paying Agent to pay or cause to be paid the
applicable Estimated Per Interest Payment Amount to such Company Member on the
Closing Date for each Company Membership Interest surrendered by the
applicable Letter of Transmittal; otherwise, the Parties shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay to such Company Member, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the applicable Estimated Per Interest Payment Amount for each
Company Membership Interest surrendered by the applicable Letter of
Transmittal no later than five (5) Business Days following receipt of such
duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal (and proper surrender of any
certificates, if applicable). Until any such duly executed Letter of
Transmittal is delivered (and any applicable certificates, if any,
surrendered) as contemplated by this _Section 2.6_ , each Company Membership
Interest (other than the Excluded Equity Interests) shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the payment
of the consideration set forth in _Section 2.2_.

  

 

15  

  

  

(c) All payments in respect of Company Membership Interests made by the Paying
Agent shall be made by check or wire transfer in accordance with the
instructions set forth in the applicable Letter of Transmittal.

  

  

(d) If any Company Membership Interests are not surrendered in accordance with
_Section 2.6(b)_ prior to the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time, any unclaimed amounts with respect thereto (including interest thereon,
if any) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to and
become the property of the Surviving Company upon its demand therefor, and may
be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving Company, free of
interest. Thereafter, any Company Member shall look only to the Surviving
Company or Buyer (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
similar Laws) for payment of their claim to the aggregate Per Interest Payment
Amount to which such Company Member is entitled for its Company Membership
Interests, without any interest thereon. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, or the
Company shall be liable to any Person for any amount delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(e) No distributions with respect to Equity Interests of the Surviving Company
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Membership Interest.

  

  

(f) All consideration paid in respect of the surrender or exchange of Company
Membership Interests in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be
in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Membership Interests.
If, after the Effective Time, Company Membership Interests are presented to
Buyer or the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.6_.

  

  

(g) If any consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Company Membership Interests surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall deliver all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and shall pay to the Surviving Company any
transfer or other Taxes payable by the Surviving Company required by reason of
the payment of such consideration to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Company Membership Interest so surrendered, or such Person shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  

  

 

16  

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
certificate representing Company Membership Interests shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Company or the Surviving Company, the posting by such person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Company or the Surviving Company
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate, the Surviving Company shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.7. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (and any
Affiliate thereof or any other withholding agent) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement (including to
any holder of Company Membership Interests), such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Law; _provided_ that
the Parent, Buyer, Surviving Company or Paying Agent, or any Affiliate thereof
or any other withholding agent, as applicable, shall notify the recipient of
the payment from which an amount is to be deducted and withheld pursuant to
this paragraph of its intent to withhold, not less than four days prior to
making such payment (or if the recipient has not provided the necessary
withholding documentation by such time, then as soon as reasonably practicable
before making such payment), and shall permit such recipient to reduce the
amount so deducted and withheld, if possible, including through the provision
of any Tax forms, reports or certificates. Any amount so deducted or withheld
and duly paid over to the applicable governmental authority shall be treated
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) there shall be no
withholding pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code so long as the Company has
complied with _Section 6.2(e)(v)_ and (ii) there shall be no withholding with
respect to a Company Member pursuant to Code Section 1446(f) so long as such
Company Member has provided a correctly completed and duly executed Non-
Foreign Affidavit for Individual Holders or Non-Foreign Affidavit for Entity
Holders, as applicable, with such Company Member's Letter of Transmittal.

and correct copies of: (i) the Company's audited consolidated balance sheets
as of December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in members'
equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "); and (ii) the
Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in members'
equity for the 3 months ended March 31, 2018 and the corresponding periods for
2017 (the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ ", together with the Audited

GAAP and that are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Company's (or the Company Subsidiaries') assets that could have a
material effect on the Company's financial statements. All significant
deficiencies in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting
identified in the report from the Company's independent auditors to the
Company Board dated as of March 23, 2018 have been remediated in all respects.

would be expected to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information. Since January 1, 2015,
the Company has not identified and has not been advised by the Company's
auditors of any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or not material, that

material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and there has not been any action taken by the Company or its

through the Closing Date without Parent's consent, would constitute a breach
of _Sections 5.1(a),_ _(b), (d), (e), (f), (i), (j), (m), (n), (o), (p)_ or
_(r)._

clearances sought to be obtained) in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (including keeping the other Parties apprised,
on a current basis of the status thereof); (ii) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, promptly inform the other Party in writing of any substantive

and (v) not independently participate in any meeting (including substantive
telephonic meetings) with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
foregoing without giving the other Party sufficient prior notice of the
meeting (including substantive telephonic meetings) and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate in such meeting (including substantive telephonic meetings).

lift, vacate, reverse or resolve any legislative, administrative or judicial

and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent and Buyer,
to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to result, after the
Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.

  

  

(f) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, neither Parent, Buyer nor Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
its Subsidiaries to not, take or agree to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent the parties from obtaining any consent of
any Governmental Entity required pursuant to any Competition Laws in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to prevent
or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any acquisition (whether via merger, consolidation, stock or asset
purchase or otherwise) of or agreement to acquire any Person or any business
or division thereof if such acquisition or agreement would be reasonably
expected to prevent, materially delay or impede the parties from obtaining
consent of any Governmental Entity required pursuant to any Competition Laws
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with
obtaining any such approval or consent with respect to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (other than with respect to a Governmental
Entity), (i) none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required
to, or, without the prior written consent of Parent (except with respect to de
minimis amounts), shall, pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such person and
(ii) none of Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur
any liability or other obligation.

Section 5.4. _Publicity_. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall issue a joint press release relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the text of which shall be
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company. Following the issuance of such
joint press release, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or public statement with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of the other Party; _provided_ that a Party may, without
obtaining the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation,
to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or
make such public statement (i) as may upon the advice of outside counsel be
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Entity to
which the relevant Party is subject or (ii) containing only information
previously publicly disclosed in accordance with this _Section 5.4_ or
otherwise consistent in all material respects with previous statements made
jointly by Parent and the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate to develop all public
announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
reasonably requested by the other Party, and the Company shall consult with
Parent regarding communications with customers, equityholders and employees
related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 5.5. _Director and Officer Indemnification_ _._

  

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Buyer will cause
the Surviving Company to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the same
extent required by the certificate of formation of the Company and the Company
LLC Agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement and as permitted
under applicable Law, all past and present directors and officers of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary (each, together with such person's heirs,
executors or administrators, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") against any
liabilities, damages, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with any Proceeding (whether asserted
before or after the Effective Time) arising out of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time in connection with such Company Indemnified
Party having served as a director or officer of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary or having served at the request of the Company as a director,
officer or employee of any other corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other business,
and, to the same extent that such Company Indemnified Parties have the right
to advancement of expenses from the Company as of the date of this Agreement,
to provide advancement of expenses to any such Company Indemnified Party,
subject to receipt of an undertaking from such Company Indemnified Party to
repay such advanced amounts if it is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final judgment that such Company Indemnified Party was not
entitled to indemnification. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company (or any
successor) to include and maintain in effect, for a period of six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the provisions regarding indemnification and
elimination of liability of directors that are in the Company's Constituent
Documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to honor all indemnification agreements with any Company
Indemnified Party set forth on _Section 5.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter to the extent such agreements remain in effect at the Effective Time.

  

 

47  

  

  

(b) At the Closing, the Buyer shall, at its expense, purchase tail coverage
under the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy for the benefit of each Company Indemnified Party, which provides
coverage for period of six (6) years after the Effective Time for acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time with terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous to such Company Indemnified Parties
than the terms and conditions of the existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event shall Buyer be required to expend for such tail coverage an amount in
excess of $60,000 (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and if the Buyer is unable to
maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section 5.5(b)_ for an
amount equal to or less than the Insurance Amount, the Buyer shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as may be available for the Insurance Amount.

  

  

(c) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties, rights
and other assets to any Person, then, in each such case to the extent so
required, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that such
successor or assign of the Surviving Company assumes the obligations set forth
in this _Section 5.5_.

  

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties following the
Closing and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification, advancement or contribution that any such Person may have
by Law, Contract or otherwise.

  

  

Section 5.6. _Employee Matters_ _._

  

  

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and until the first anniversary thereof
(or such shorter period as the applicable employee continues to be employed by
Parent or the Surviving Company), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to provide, to each Company Employee who is employed by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") who continues to be employed by Parent or the
Surviving Company or any Subsidiary thereof (1) base salary or base wages and
target annual incentive cash opportunities that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than those provided by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (2) employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based
compensation and the compensation and benefits set forth in _Section 5.6_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter) that are, in the aggregate, substantially
comparable to, in Parent's sole discretion, either (A) those provided by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) those made available to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its affiliates. Parent will give,
or cause the Surviving Company to give, each Continuing Employee credit for
the Continuing Employee's service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (as
applicable) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and entitlement to amount of vacation, sick leave and severance benefits (but
not benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan), to the same
extent such service was recognized under a similar Company Benefit Plan,
except in each case, to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative
benefits. Parent will use commercially reasonably efforts to allow Continuing
Employees to participate in each plan providing welfare benefits, including
medical, life insurance, long-term disability insurance and long-term care
insurance, without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting
periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not
imposed on the Continuing Employee by the corresponding Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

 

48  

  

  

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or
any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any affiliate of Parent, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Surviving Company, the Company or any affiliate
of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other
applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 5.6_
shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of
any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent or Merger Sub,
(ii) create any third party rights in any Person or (iii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them.

  

  

(c) If requested by Parent prior to the Closing Date, the Company Board (or
the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary to terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 401(k)
Plans_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such resolutions and any documents prepared in connection with such corporate
actions prior to the adoption of such resolutions or taking of such action.

  

  

(d) The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
if such communications relate to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, to the extent practicable, shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such communications prior to
distribution.

  

 

49  

  

  

Section 5.7. _Payoff of Credit Facilities_. The Company shall arrange for
customary payoff letters and instruments of discharge to be delivered at
Closing providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing
Date of all then-outstanding indebtedness of, and commitments under, the
Credit Facilities, and shall deliver prepayment and termination notices in
accordance with the terms of the Credit Facilities ( _provided_ that such
prepayment and termination notices may be conditional on the occurrence of the
Closing).

  

  

Section 5.8. _Holder Consents_. As soon as practicable after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with the Act and the Company's certificate of formation and limited
liability company agreement, to solicit and obtain the written consent of
holders of at least a majority of each class of voting interests of Company
Membership Interests, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_
, to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Merger Consent_ ") and approve the provisions of
_Section 9.12_ (Holder Representative) as it relates to such holder. The
Company shall cause the Merger Consent to be delivered to Buyer as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 24 hours following the time this Agreement
is executed and delivered by the Parties. Immediately following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer, as sole member of Merger Sub, shall
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the related transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the Act and Buyer's and Merger Sub's
organizational documents.

  

  

Section 5.9. ___Exclusivity_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, none of the Company or the Holder Representative
shall, and the Company and the Holder Representative shall not permit or cause
any of their respective controlled Affiliates and their and their respective
controlled Affiliates' Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a)
initiate, solicit, enter into, maintain, continue or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person (other than
Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub and their Representatives) concerning any purchase
or acquisition of all or a material portion of the Equity Interests of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
reorganization or business combination involving, or sale of all or
substantial portion of the assets of, the Company or its Subsidiaries or
similar transactions involving the Company or its Subsidiaries (each such
transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), (b) solicit, initiate,
facilitate or encourage the submission of any proposal, indication of interest
or offer from any Person (other than Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub and their
Representatives) relating to an Acquisition Transaction or (c) enter into any
letter of intent or purchase agreement, merger agreement, term sheet or
Contract with any Person other than Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub and their
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. Each of the
Company and the Holder Representative shall, and the Company and the Holder
Representative shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates and their
and their respective controlled Affiliates' Representatives to, promptly, to
the extent that they have not done so already, (i) cause any negotiations,
discussions or activities of the type described in the preceding sentence that
may currently be in progress to be terminated and (ii) request and require all
third parties to whom information has been given by or on behalf of the
Company, the Holder Representative or any of their controlled Affiliates, if
any, to destroy or return such information to the Company, the Holder
Representative or any of their respective controlled Affiliates to the extent
the Company, the Holder Representative or any of their respective controlled
Affiliates has the power to do so pursuant to a Contract or otherwise.

  

  

Section 5.10. _Debt Financing_ _._

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall use their
reasonable best efforts to provide all customary cooperation reasonably
requested in writing by Parent and Buyer in connection with Parent and/or
Buyer arranging any debt financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which debt financing may be incurred before or
following the Closing, including amendments to Parent's credit facility or
issuing private placement bonds (the " _Debt Financing_ "), including all
cooperation reasonably requested to enable Parent, Buyer and their
Representatives to prepare financial statements, including pro forma financial
statements, in compliance with applicable SEC requirements for use in a
registered or unregistered offering of debt securities in connection with such
Debt Financing and to enable accountants of Parent and/or the Company to audit
or review such financial statements, including, if requested by Parent, using
reasonable best efforts to (x) provide a customary representation letter in
such form as is reasonably required by accountants of Parent and/or the
Company, as applicable, with such facts and assumptions as reasonably
determined by such accountants in order to make such certificate accurate,
signed by the individual(s) responsible for the Company's financial reporting,
as prescribed by generally accepted auditing standards as promulgated by the
Auditing Standards Divisions of the American Institute of Public Accountants
in order to enable an independent public accountant to render an opinion on
such financial statements, (y) cause the auditor of the Company's financial
statements to provide its consent to the inclusion of such report, without
exception or qualification, with respect to the Audited Financial Statements
in any offering document of Parent or Buyer or any report of Parent or Buyer
filed with the SEC, and (z) to provide to Parent and its underwriters, or the
equivalent in an unregistered offering of securities, customary and
appropriate comfort letters in accordance with the American Institute of
Public Accountants' professional standards and to participate in due diligence
sessions customarily conducted in connection with the provision of comfort
letters. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide to Parent and Buyer the Company's unaudited
consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018, and the related statements of
income or operations for the 6-month periods ended June 30, 2018 as soon as
reasonably practicable following the end of the Company's second quarter of
2018 period but in no event later than August 4, 2018. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would unreasonably interfere in any material respect with the business or
operations of the Company or Company Subsidiaries or require the Company or
Company Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses, incur
any liability or give any indemnities prior to the Closing except to the
extent subject to indemnification and reimbursement pursuant to _Section
5.10(b_ ); (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to enter into (or approve) any definitive agreement related to any
proposed Debt Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would
be effective prior to the Closing; (iii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that would require any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
execute, or be required to enter into, or adopt any resolutions approving, any
document, agreement, certificate or instrument (other than with respect to any
authorization letter described in this _Section 5.10_ ) in connection with the
Debt Financing except as may be effective at or after the Closing; (iv)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
in connection with the Debt Financing any information the disclosure of which
is prohibited or restricted under Law or is legally privileged; and (v) none
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to provide, and
Parent and the Buyer shall be solely responsible for, (1) the preparation of
pro forma financial information, including pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into
any pro forma financial information, (2) any description of all or any
component of the Debt Financing, including any such description to be included
in any liquidity or capital resources disclosure or any "description of
notes", (3) projections, risk factors or other forward-looking statements
relating to all or any component of the Debt Financing, (4) subsidiary
financial statements or any other information of the type required by Rule
3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (5) Compensation Disclosure
and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K or (6) any solvency
certificate or equivalent certification or representation.

  

 

50  

  

  

(b) Upon request by the Company, Parent and Buyer shall promptly (and in any
event within ten (10) calendar days of invoice) reimburse the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred by the Company and/or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with providing the cooperation contemplated by
_Section 5.10(a)_. Parent and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and each of their respective
Representatives, from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
interest, costs or expenses (including legal fees and expenses), awards,
judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the Debt Financing, including providing the
support and cooperation contemplated by _Section 5.10(a)_ and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than written factual information,
other than projections, estimates, budgets and other forward-looking
information and information of a general economic or industry specific
nature), that has been provided to Parent or its Affiliates with the express
and written agreement that such information is to be used in the marketing
materials for the Debt Financing).

  

  

(c) Parent and Buyer each acknowledge and agree that (i) the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be conditioned on,
or delayed or postponed as a result of the obtaining of (or the failure to
obtain) the Debt Financing, and (ii) it shall continue to be obligated to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Debt Financing.

  

  

(d) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such information to
any Debt Financing sources and other financial institutions and investors that
are or may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters,
initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing
(and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such
Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties
thereto, or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

  

 

51  

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the condition
set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ , as it applies to the Company's and the Company
Subsidiaries' obligations under this _Section 5.10_ , shall be deemed
satisfied unless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have Willfully
Breached their obligations under this _Section 5.10_ and such Willful Breach
has been a primary cause of the Debt Financing not being obtained.

  

  

Section 5.11. _Tax Matters_ _._

  

  

(a) For any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, the Holder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and, _provided_ Buyer cooperates pursuant to _Section 5.11(e)_ as may be
reasonably required, file or cause to be filed (in a manner consistent with
past practices and in accordance with applicable Law) with the appropriate
taxing authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed, and all Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns that are the primary liability of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, income or
other Taxes of the Company Members) shall reduce any Deferred Payment Amount
to the extent required under _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Holder Representative shall permit Buyer to review and comment on
each such Tax Return described in this sentence. For any Straddle Period of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, Buyer shall timely prepare or
cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns required
to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns that
are the primary liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (and not,
for the avoidance of doubt, income or other Taxes of the Company Members);
_provided_ that any such amounts with respect to Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall reduce any
Deferred Payment Amount to the extent required under _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_.
Buyer shall (i) with respect to any Tax Return described in the preceding
sentence, provide Holder Representative a reasonable opportunity to review,
and, with respect to any Tax items shown on such a Tax Return relating to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, comment thereon,
and (ii) not file any such Tax Return without receiving the written consent of
the Holder Representative with respect to any such Tax items prior to the
filing thereof, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

  

  

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be:

  

  

(i) In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal
property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; and

  

  

(ii) In the case of Taxes not described in (i) above (such as Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed
in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real
or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be
determined as if such Tax period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

  

 

52  

  

  

(c) Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file or cause to be
filed when due all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for taxable years or
periods ending after the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) _Tax Claims_.

  

  

(i) With respect to any claim for indemnification for a breach of a
representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.12_ or a covenant contained
in _Section 5.1(o)_ or under _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ ")
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Holder Representative shall, solely
at its own cost and expense, control all proceedings and may make all
decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim and, without limiting the
foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing
authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay
the Tax claimed or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; _provided_
, however, that the Holder Representative must first consult, in good faith
with Buyer before taking any action with respect to the conduct of such Tax
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall not
settle such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Buyer, and counsel of its own
choosing at Buyer's sole expense, shall have the right to participate fully in
all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim if it reasonably
determines that such Tax Claim could have a material adverse impact on the
Taxes of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in a Tax period or
portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date.

  

  

(ii) With respect to any proceeding taken in connection with a Tax Claim
relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle
Period, to the extent possible, Tax liabilities will be distinguished and each
Party shall control the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is
so liable (with the Holder Representative controlling the defense and
settlement of those Taxes for which a Buyer Indemnified Party would be
indemnified), although the other Party (or the Holder Representative on behalf
of the Company) shall have the right to participate in such proceedings (at
its own expense). To the extent a Tax liability cannot be so attributed, the
Party that has the greater potential liability shall control the defense and
settlement (with the Holder Representative controlling the defense and
settlement of those Taxes for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties would be
indemnified for the greater potential liability); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the controlling Party (or the Holder Representative on behalf of the
Company) shall not settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent
of the other Party (or the Holder Representative on behalf of the Company),
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. As
between this _Section 5.11(d)(ii)_ and _Section 8.3_ , this _Section
5.11(d)(ii)_ shall control.

  

 

53  

  

  

(e) _Cooperation_. Buyer and Holder Representative shall, upon request of the
other Person, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer
and Holder Representative shall reasonably cooperate with each other in a
timely manner in the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns, the payment of
any Taxes in accordance with this Agreement, the conduct of any Tax audit or
other Tax proceeding, and the settlement of any Tax Claim. Buyer shall cause
the Company to retain copies of all reports, returns or records relating to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods (including original books and
records supporting schedules and data) for the shorter of (i) a period of
twelve (12) years or (ii) the expiration of the statute of limitations with
respect to the Taxes relating to particular reports, returns or records. At
the reasonable request and the expense of Holder Representative, Buyer shall
cause the Company to deliver to Holder Representative a copy of any and all
such reports, returns or records during the period Buyer is required under the
prior sentence to retain such documents.

  

  

(f) For U.S. federal income tax purposes and applicable state and local tax
purposes, the Buyer will treat the Merger as a purchase of the Company's
assets and the Company Members will treat the Merger as a sale of their
interests in the Company as described in Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6,
and no Party shall take a position inconsistent with such treatment on any Tax
Return, unless required by applicable law. In accordance with such tax
treatment, within sixty (60) days after the determination of the Final
Purchase Price, Buyer shall deliver to the Holder Representative a schedule
(the " _Preliminary Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating the Final Purchase
Price (which for this purpose shall be deemed to include any liabilities
properly taken into account pursuant to Section 1001 of the Code) among the
direct and indirect assets of the Company. The Preliminary Allocation Schedule
shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. If, within sixty (60) days following receipt of the
Preliminary Allocation Schedule, the Holder Representative does not notify
Buyer in writing of its disagreement with the Preliminary Allocation Schedule,
the Preliminary Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding. If, within
such sixty (60) day period, the Holder Representative so notifies Buyer, the
Holder Representative and Buyer shall use good faith efforts to resolve such
disagreement, and if such disagreements are resolved then the agreed upon
Preliminary Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding. If such a
disagreement is unable to be resolved, then the Preliminary Allocation
Schedule shall be determined by an Independent Accountant in accordance with
the procedure set forth in _Section 2.4(c)_ and shall become final and
binding, and any costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be
borne by the Buyer and the Holder Representative as described in _Section
2.4(c)_. The Preliminary Allocation Schedule, upon becoming final and binding
in accordance with the foregoing, shall constitute the " _Final Allocation
Schedule_ ". Neither the Parties nor any of their Affiliates shall file any
federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in a manner that is inconsistent
with the Final Allocation Schedule. The Final Allocation Schedule shall be
amended as mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Holder Representative acting in
good faith upon payment or receipt of any amount hereunder that is treated as
an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes
using a method that consistent with the determination of the Final Allocation
Schedule.

  

 

54  

  

  

(g) _Buyer 's Tax Act_. Without the prior written consent of Holder
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Buyer shall not (a) amend any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (b) make or change any Tax election of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,

indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnified Party shall within five
(5) days of such Tax Benefit being realized pay to the Person or Persons that
made such indemnification payment the amount of such Tax Benefit.

such insurance recovery or third party recovery and the amount of the related
indemnification payment. To the extent an Indemnified Party may have insurance
coverage for the claim, such Indemnified will use commercially reasonable to

media that Buyer may conduct shall be deemed not to be Losses subject to
indemnification thereunder, unless such sampling or testing is required by any
applicable Environmental Laws, or by any Order or directive of any
Governmental Entity (except for any such Order or directive that results from
soliciting or importuning by any Buyer Indemnified Party), and (ii) that such
indemnification, with respect to any measures taken to remediate or otherwise
respond to any condition or correct any violation at any Owned Real Property
or Leased Real Property, shall be limited to the amount needed to implement
reasonably least costly measures necessary to comply with such minimum
standards required to be achieved under Environmental Laws as are applicable
for continued industrial use of the subject property as operated and
configured as of Closing (including, if available and cost-effective,
implementation and use of reasonable deed restrictions, institutional controls
and engineered barriers).

  

 

64  

  

  

Section 8.3. _Procedure for Indemnification_ _._

  

  

(a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification under _Section 8.2_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, in the
case of a Buyer Indemnified Party, promptly notify in writing the Holder
Representative and, in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party, promptly notify
in writing Buyer (any such notice, a " _Notice of Claim_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, subject to _Section 8.1(a)_ , no delay on the part of any
Indemnified Party in providing such notice shall adversely affect the rights
of the Indemnified Party under _Section 8.2_. The Notice of Claim shall set
forth in reasonable detail (i) the date and nature and basis of such claim and
(ii) a good faith estimate of the amount of such claim. The Indemnified Party
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Holder
Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, in relation to such claim.

  

  

(b) If a claim for indemnification is with respect to a Proceeding by a third-
party against an Indemnified Party, the Holder Representative, in the case of
a claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party and Buyer, in the case of a claim by a
Seller Indemnified Party (the Holder Representative or Buyer, as applicable,
the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), shall be entitled (but not obligated), by
written notice to the Indemnified Party within ninety (90) days of the receipt
of the Notice of Claim, to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Proceeding with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (subject to the
reasonable approval of the Indemnified Party) at the Indemnifying Party's sole
cost and expense; _provided_ _however_ that prior to assuming such control of
the Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing that it is
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Proceeding
to the extent provided for in, and subject to the limitations of, this
_Article VIII_. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Proceeding without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the judgment or proposed settlement
(i) involves only the payment of money damages against which the Indemnified
Party is indemnified in full pursuant to this _Article VIII_ at the time of
such settlement, (ii) releases the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from
all liability or obligation in connection with such Proceeding, (iii) does not
impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates and (iv) does not involve a finding or admission of any
violation of applicable Law by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such a Proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense,
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and its
attorneys in such defense. The Indemnifying Party may not assume control of,
or continue to control, the defense of any such Proceeding (x) involving
alleged criminal liabilities of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
or (y) seeking the imposition of any equitable remedy excepting injunctive
relief that is de minimis and ancillary to a damages claim that would be
binding upon the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. In any such
Proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at its own expense
unless representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
by the same counsel would represent a conflict of interest for such counsel
under applicable standards of professional conduct for attorneys or the
Indemnified Party has been advised by its counsel that there are one or more
legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those
available to any Indemnifying Party, in which case the Indemnifying Party will
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. This _Section 8.3(b)_
shall not apply to any Tax Claim, which shall be governed by _Section 5.11_.

  

 

65  

  

  

Section 8.4. _Offset of Deferred Payment Amounts_ _._

  

  

(a) In the event there are any claims for indemnification by a Buyer
Indemnified Party (such claims, " _Offset Claims_ " and the aggregate amount
of such Offset Claims, the " _Aggregate Offset Amount_ "), if any Deferred
Payment Amount would otherwise become due following the time such Offset
Claims have been made, such Deferred Payment Amount shall be reduced dollar-
for-dollar by the Aggregate Offset Amount and if the Aggregate Offset Amount
is greater than such Deferred Payment Amount, any further Deferred Payment
Amounts that would otherwise become due following such time shall also be
reduced dollar-for-dollar until and to the extent the Deferred Payment Amounts
that would otherwise have become due have been reduced, in the aggregate, by
amount equal to the Aggregate Offset Amount. In the event all Offset Claims
are finally resolved (either pursuant to agreement between Parent and the
Holder Representatives or by a final, non-appealable order from a court of
competent jurisdiction) for an amount (the aggregate amount for all Offset
Claims, the " _Offset Final Resolution Amount_ ") that is less than the
Aggregate Offset Amount, then Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to)
deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the excess of (i) the
Aggregate Offset Amount _minus_ (ii) the Offset Final Resolution Amount, for
payment of the Offset Claims Per Interest Payment owed, with respect to all
Company Membership Interests, to the former Company Members. The Paying Agent
shall promptly disburse the funds received pursuant to this _Section 8.4(a)_
to the former Company Members in accordance with the Updated Distribution
Waterfall and in accordance with _Article II_.

  

  

(b) The " _Offset Claims Per Interest Payment_ " means, with respect to any
Company Membership Interest, the amount that would be distributed in respect
of such Company Membership Interest in accordance with Section 5.1(b) of the
Company LLC Agreement upon the consummation of a sale of the Company with a
distribution amount that is equal to (i) the Aggregate Offset Amount _minus_
(ii) the Offset Final Resolution Amount, in accordance with the Updated
Distribution Waterfall.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Deferred Payment Amounts
shall not be reduced by more than (i) $8,333,333 in the aggregate as a result
of adjustments to the Final Purchase Price under _Section 2.4(f)_ , (ii) $82.5
million in the aggregate as a result of (A) indemnification under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of Fundamental Representations and (B)
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(ii)-(v)_ , (iii) $3,000,000 in the
aggregate as a result of indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_ , (iv)
$1,000,000 in the aggregate as a result of indemnification under _Section
8.2(a)(vii)_ and (iv) $3,093,750 in the aggregate as a result of
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties other than Fundamental Representations.
Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied herein to the contrary, once the
Deferred Payment Amounts have been reduced by $3,093,750 with respect to
Offset Claims as a result of indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ with
respect to breaches of representations and warranties other than Fundamental
Representations, (i) no current or former equity holder of the Company,
including the Company Members, shall have any direct or indirect liability
with respect to, or any obligation to satisfy, any claim by any Buyer
Indemnified Party under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ with respect to any breach claim
other than with respect to Fundamental Representations and (ii) the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of any such
Losses shall be limited to the RandW Policy. No current or former equity holder
of the Company, including the Company Members, shall have any direct or
indirect liability of any kind or nature with respect to the RandW Policy
(including by way of subrogation), except with respect to Fraud.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Deferred Payment Amounts
shall not be reduced as a result of claims for indemnification under _Section
8.2(a)(vi)_ made after the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

 

66  

  

  

(d) If applicable, any Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled
to recover pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy or breach of
Fundamental Representations or _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ shall be satisfied in the
following order of recovery: (i) first, solely to the extent any portion of
the retention amount under the RandW Policy remains to be eroded, recovered via
an Offset Claim to the extent of such remaining retention amount, subject to
the other limitations set forth in _Section 8.2_ and this _Section 8.4_ , (ii)
second, to the extent such claims would be covered by the RandW Policy, by
submission of claims to the RandW Policy, and (iii) third, to the extent the
policy limit under the RandW Policy has been reached and coverage thereunder has
been fully depleted or such claims would not be covered by the RandW Policy,
recovered directly via an Offset Claim, subject to the other limitations set
forth in _Section 8.2_ and this _Section 8.4_.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to a right to offset under this _Section 8.4_ to the extent such
Losses would have been covered under the RandW Policy if not for a failure by a
Buyer Indemnified Party to properly make a claim thereunder (or otherwise
comply with the terms thereof).

  

  

(f) The Parties shall treat any indemnification payment made pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for income Tax
purposes, if allowable by Law.

warranties and covenants set forth herein), benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective

force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so
long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated

any Party hereto.

  

  

 

69  

  

Section 9.8. _Assignment_ _. _ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,

construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  

  

Section 9.10. _Exclusive Jurisdiction_ _. _ Each of the Parties (a) consents

federal court located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages

waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

 

70  

  

Section 9.12. _Holder Representative_ _._

  

  

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the Merger Consent, and
without any further action of any of the holders of Company Membership
Interests or the Company, Jonathan Victor hereby irrevocably nominated,
constituted and appointed as the exclusive representative, agent and true and
lawful attorney in fact of holders of Company Membership Interests (the "
_Holder Representative_ "), with full power of substitution (and, if
substituted, the Holder Representative will promptly notify Parent and Buyer
of such substitution) to act in the name, place and stead of the holders of
Company Membership Interests with respect to this Agreement, as the same may
be from time to time amended, and with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to do or refrain from doing all such acts and things,
and to execute all such documents, as the Holder Representative shall deem
necessary or appropriate in connection with this Agreement, any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder
Representatives is hereby authorized to take all actions on behalf of the
holders of Company Membership Interests in connection with any actions taken
or to be taken under _Article II_ and _Article VIII_. Any vacancy in the
position of Holder Representative may be filled by the Person set forth on
_Section 9.12_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, subject to the right of
holders representing a majority of the Company Membership Interests
immediately prior to the Effective Time to replace any Holder Representative
so appointed.

  

  

(b) All decisions and actions of the Holder Representative shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the holders of Company Membership Interests and may
be relied upon by Parent, Buyer and their Affiliates as the decisions and
actions of the holders of Company Membership Interests. The Holder
Representative shall not be liable to any of the holders of Company Membership
Interests for any act done or omitted by the Holder Representative in good
faith pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto or any
mistake of fact or Law unless caused by the Holder Representative's fraud or
willful misconduct in the performance of its duties under this Agreement. The
holders of Company Membership Interests will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Holder Representative from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Holder Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Holder Representative's execution and performance of this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Holder
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event
that any such Holder Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Holder
Representative, the Holder Representative will reimburse the holders of
Company Membership Interests the amount of such indemnified Holder
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Holder Representative by the
holders of Company Membership Interests, any such Holder Representative Losses
may be recovered by the Holder Representative from the funds in the Holder
Representative Expense Funds; _provided_ , that while this _Section 9.12_
allows the Holder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the holders of Company Membership Interests from
their obligation to promptly pay such Holder Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Holder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Holder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
holders of Company Membership Interests or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of the holders of Company Membership
Interests set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Holder Representative under this
_Section 9.12_. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Holder Representative or the termination of this
Agreement. In taking any action or refraining from taking any action
whatsoever the Holder Representative shall be protected in relying upon any
notice, paper or other document reasonably believed by it to be genuine, or
upon any evidence reasonably deemed by it to be sufficient. The Holder
Representative may consult with counsel in connection with its duties and
shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good
faith in accordance with the advice of counsel.

  

 

71  

  

  

(c) The holders of Company Membership Interests will not receive any interest
or earnings on the Holder Representative Expense Funds and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Holder Representative any ownership right that they
may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Holder
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Holder
Representative Expense Funds other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Holder Representative will hold these funds separate
from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses
or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. For tax purposes, the
Holder Representative Expense Funds will be treated as having been received
and voluntarily set aside by the holders of Company Membership Interests at
the time of Closing. If there are any Holder Representative Expense Funds
remaining following the payment by the Holder Representative of all costs and
expenses that may be reasonably expected to be incurred by the Holder
Representative, in its capacity as such, in connection the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, at such time the Holder Representative shall
deposit (a) with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Holder
Representative Unused Funds Per Interest Payment owed, with respect to all
Company Membership Interests, to the former Company Members. The Paying Agent
shall promptly disburse the funds received pursuant to this _Section 9.12(c)_
to the former Company Members in accordance with the Updated Distribution
Waterfall and in accordance with _Article II_.

  

  

Section 9.13. _Counterparts_ _._ This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties (including by facsimile or
via portable document format (.pdf)), it being understood that all Parties
need not sign the same counterpart.

  

 

72

"including" shall be deemed to be followed by "without limitation" whether or
not they are in fact followed by such words or words of like import. The words

Section 9.15. _Financing Source Related Parties_ _. _ Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto: (a)
agrees that it will not bring or support any Person, or permit any of its
Affiliates to bring or support any Person, in any action, suit, proceeding,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Source Related Parties in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

way to any Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York State

Financing commitments, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in

Related Parties in any way relating to any Debt Financing commitments or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; and (c) HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN
CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO ANY DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE
FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Financing Source Related Parties are intended
third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the protections of this
provision to the same extent as if the Financing Sources were parties to this
Agreement. This Section 9.15 may not be amended, modified or supplemented, or
any of its provisions waived, without the written consent of the Financing
Source Related Parties, which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole
discretion of the Financing Source Related Parties. For purposes of this
Agreement, (a) "Financing Source Related Parties" shall mean the Financing
Sources, their Affiliates and their respective former, current and future
directors, officers, managers, members, stockholders, partners, employees,
agents, Representatives, successors and permitted assigns and (b) "Financing
Sources" shall mean, in their capacity as such, any lender providing a
commitment pursuant to any Debt Financing or any Affiliates, employees,
officers, directors, agents or advisors of any such lender.

Section 9.16. _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_ _._ Each of Parent,
Buyer and Merger Sub and the Company (on its behalf and on behalf of the
Surviving Company) hereby waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive,
any claim that it may have that Jones Day has a conflict of interest that may
arise in connection with Jones Day representing any of the holders of Company
Membership Interests or their respective Affiliates (including the Holder
Representative) after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent,
Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub and the
Company (on behalf of the Surviving Company) hereby agrees that, in the event
that a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, Buyer, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
Holder Representative or the holders of Company Membership Interests, on the
other hand, Jones Day may represent any or all of the Holder Representative or
the holders of Company Membership Interests in such dispute even though the
interests of such Holder Representative or the holders of Company Membership
Interests may be directly adverse to Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Company or
any of their respective Affiliates, and even though Jones Day formerly may
have represented the Company and its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. In addition, all communications involving attorney-
