 _SECTION 2.05_ _Net Working Capital Adjustment_. 

   

 (a) Not more than five (5) Business Days nor fewer than two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a written and detailed statement of the Net Working Capital (the " _Statement of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ ") dated as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ "), including the resulting Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Shortage (if any), which Statement of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital shall be prepared in good faith and in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Interim Financial Statements and shall be accompanied by a written certificate to Parent, executed by the Chief Financial Officer on behalf of the Company, certifying that the Statement of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital was so prepared. 

   

 (b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall review the Statement of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and deliver to the Escrow Participants Representative a statement of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date, signed by an executive officer or the Controller of Parent (the " _Statement of Closing Net Working Capital_ "). The Statement of Closing Net Working Capital shall set forth the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), including a detailed breakdown of the various amounts of each component of Net Working Capital and taking into account additional information that becomes available or events occurring after the Closing Date and prior to the preparation of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital. 

   

 (c) Within thirty (30) days following Parents delivery of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, the Escrow Participants Representative shall deliver a written notice (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Parent of any dispute the Escrow Participants Representative has with respect to the preparation or content of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Net Working Capital. The Notice of Disagreement shall describe in reasonable detail the items contained in the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital that the Escrow Participants Representative disputes and the basis for any such dispute. If the Escrow Participants Representative does not notify Parent of a dispute with respect to the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital within such 30-day period or notifies Parent that it does not have any dispute with the information reflected in the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, such Statement of Closing Net Working Capital shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties and the Closing Net Working Capital reflected thereon shall become the " _Final Net Working Capital_." In the event a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Parent, the Escrow Participants Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute and agree upon the " _Final Net Working Capital_." If the Escrow Participants Representative and Parent, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within ten (10) Business Days after the Escrow Participants Representative delivers the Notice of Disagreement, then the Escrow Participants Representative and Parent jointly shall engage a U.S. accounting firm of national reputation as is reasonably acceptable to the Escrow Participants Representative and Parent that has not provided services to either of Parent or its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates during the prior three (3) years (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve such dispute in accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section 2.05_. Parent and the Escrow Participants Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days after the making of such submission. The Accounting Firm shall address only those items in dispute. The 

   ##### 

  

    

Accounting Firm shall determine, on such basis, whether and to what extent,
the Closing Net Working Capital requires adjustment, which determination
shall be consistent with either the position of the Escrow Participants
Representative or the position of Parent or between the positions of
the Escrow Participants Representative and Parent and the amount determined
by the Accounting Firm shall become the " _Final Net Working Capital_."
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be enforced. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. The Escrow Participants Representative
and/or Parent shall share the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
proportionately based on which partys position was closer to the
determination by the Accounting Firm. For purposes of complying with the
terms set forth in this _Section 2.05_, each party shall cooperate with and
make available to the other parties and their respective representatives all
information, records, data and working papers, and shall permit reasonable
access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in
connection with the preparation and analysis of the Statement of Closing Net
Working Capital. 

   

 (d) Following the determination of the Final Net Working Capital, the following payments, if any, shall be made: 

  

 (i) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than or equal to the Target Net Working Capital and there was not an Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Shortage, then no additional amounts will be owed by Parent or the Company Securityholders to the other. 

  

 (ii) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than or equal to the Target Net Working Capital and there was an Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Shortage, then Parent shall be required to pay an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Shortage. 

  

 (iii) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital and there was not an Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Shortage, then Parent shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital. 

  

 (iv) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital and there was an Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Shortage, then: 

  

 (A) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Parent shall be required to pay an amount equal to the difference between the Final Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital; and 

  

 (B) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Parent shall be entitled to receive an amount equal the difference between the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and the Final Net Working Capital. 

   

 (e) If Parent is obligated to pay any amount pursuant to _Section 2.05(d)(ii) _or  _Section 2.05(d)(iv)(A)_ (such amount, the " _Post-Closing Cash Consideration_ "), Parent shall, 

   ##### 

  

    

within five (5) Business Days after the Final Net Working Capital has
been established (i) pay the Post-Closing Cash Consideration to the Escrow
Participants Representative in immediately available funds, and such
payment, when made, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
the rights of the Escrow Participants under _Sections 2.02(c)(viii)_, 
_2.02(d)(viii)_ , _2.03(a)(ii)_ and _2.04(b)_ , and (ii) execute
written instructions to the Escrow Agent, instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse all of the funds in the Net Working Capital Escrow Fund to the
Escrow Participants Representative and such payment, when made, shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of the rights of the
Escrow Participants under _Sections 2.02(c)(vi)_ and _2.02(d)(vi)_. If
Parent is entitled to receive any amount pursuant to any provision of
_Section 2.05(d)_ (such amount, the " _Closing Net Working Capital Shortage_
"), Parent and the Escrow Participants Representative shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Net Working Capital has been established,
execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse the Closing Net Working Capital Shortage to Parent from the
Net Working Capital Escrow Fund and, to the extent the amount in the Net
Working Capital Escrow Fund is less than the Closing Net Working Capital
Shortage, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and immediately thereafter
to disburse any amount remaining in the Net Working Capital Escrow Fund to
the Escrow Participants Representative and such payment, when made, shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of the rights of the Escrow
Participants under _Sections 2.02(c)(vi)_ and  _2.02(d)(vi)_. If Parent is
neither required to pay any amount nor entitled to receive any amount under
_Section 2.05(d)_, then within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Net Working Capital has been established, Parent and the Escrow Participants
Representative shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent,
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Net Working Capital Escrow Fund
to the Escrow Participants Representative and such payment, when made, shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of the rights of the
Escrow Participants under _Sections 2.02(c)(vi)_ and _2.02(d)(vi)_.

 _SECTION 2.07_ _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

 (i) With respect to the Key Stockholders, within three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, and with respect to all other Company Stockholders, promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver or instruct the Paying Agent to deliver to each Company Stockholder at the address provided by the Company in the Transaction Schedule (A) a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificate(s) representing all of the shares of Company Stock held by such Company Stockholder in exchange for the Stock Closing Payment that is payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such certificate(s). The payment of the Stock Closing Payment with respect to each such certificate(s) is conditioned upon (1) the execution and delivery of such letter of transmittal and (2) the delivery of such certificates. Promptly after receipt by the Paying Agent of such certificate(s), properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, for cancellation, together with such duly executed letter of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange therefor, pay to such Company Stockholder the Stock Closing Payment payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly represented by the certificate(s) surrendered, but without interest, and the certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of any portion of the applicable Stock Closing Payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate(s) are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment (x) shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate(s) surrendered, and shall have 

   ##### 

  

    

established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
has been paid, or (y) shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax is not applicable. From and after the
Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.04(b)_,
each certificate formerly representing shares of Company Stock shall be
deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive
the consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly
represented thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner
provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent to deliver the Stock Closing
Payment to each Key Stockholder and the Warrant Closing Payment to the holder
of the Warrant on the Closing Date and, in any event, promptly after the
Effective Time for (A) any Key Stockholder that delivers the fully completed
and duly executed letter of transmittal, together with wire instructions and
the applicable Tax forms, and (B) the holder of the Warrant (to the extent
the Warrant is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time) if the
holder delivers wire instructions and the applicable Tax forms, each within
one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (ii) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, in accordance with its customary payroll practices, pay to the holder of In-the-Money Options, the Option Closing Payment payable in respect of each In-the-Money Option, but without interest and subject to applicable withholding and other Taxes. 

  

 (iii) Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, mail to the holder of the Warrant as of the Effective Time at the address provided by the Company in the Transaction Schedule (A) a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of all rights in and to the Common Stock subject to the Warrant in exchange for the Warrant Closing Payment. The payment of the Warrant Closing Payment in respect of the Warrant is conditioned upon the execution and delivery of such transmittal letter. Promptly after receipt by the Paying Agent of such duly executed letter of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange therefor, pay to such Participating Warrant Holder the Warrant Closing Payment in respect of the Warrant so surrendered, but without interest. 

  

 (iv) For the purpose of releasing funds to Company Securityholders pursuant to this  _Section 3.04(b)_, the Payment Agent shall round the aggregate amount of all Stock Closing Payments, Option Closing Payments and Warrant Closing Payments payable to each Company Securityholder to the nearest cent. 

  

 _SECTION 3.05_ _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of the shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall cancel and exchange, as provided in Section 3.04, any presented certificate representing shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 _SECTION 3.06_ _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any earnings received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to Company Securityholders and thereafter such Company Securityholders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) and only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Applicable Merger Consideration payable to them, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a certificate formerly representing shares of Company Stock for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Company Securityholders three (3) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 _SECTION 3.07_ _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of any amounts (or any portion thereof) payable pursuant to this Agreement to, or on behalf of, any Company Securityholder, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of any amounts payable pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to, or on the behalf of, any Company Securityholder, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as having been paid to the Company Securityholder to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 _SECTION 3.08_ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate(s) which formerly represented shares of Company Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact by the Company Stockholder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay such Company Stockholder such Company Stockholders Stock Closing Payment as provided in  _Section 3.04(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to issuing such instruction to the Paying Agent, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 _SECTION 3.09_ _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of _Section 3.04(b)_ shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations of Parent under _Section 3.04(b)_ shall commence on the date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the applicable amounts provided in _Section 3.04(b)_.

If the Escrow Participants Representative shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but elects in writing not to do so, then Parent shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, _provided_  that Parent shall keep the Escrow Participants Representative informed of all developments on a timely basis and Parent shall not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the Escrow Participants indemnification obligations under this Agreement without Escrow Participants Representative written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 _SECTION 9.04_ _Limits on Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) Except for indemnification for any Damages that are suffered or incurred by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties or to which any of the Parent Indemnified Parties may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any Third Party Claim or Action), and that arise from or as a result of, or are connected with (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation or breach of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by the Company, the Escrow Participants Representative or any Company Securityholder or (ii) a breach or failure of any representation and warranty in _Section 4.03_ ( _Capitalization_ ), _Section 4.05_ ( _Transaction Schedule_ ) and _Section 4.13_ ( _Benefit Plans_ ), the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of a Parent Claim shall be limited to recourse against the Indemnification Escrow Fund. In the event of a breach or failure of any representation or warranty referenced in subclause "(ii)" of the foregoing sentence the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to make a Parent Claim to the extent all Damages previously recovered by the Parent Indemnified Parties under _Section 9.02_, together with any Damages resulting from any such breach or failure of any representation or warranty referenced in subclause "(ii)" of the foregoing sentence (but for the avoidance of doubt, all Damages shall be counted only once), exceed Twenty Seven Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($27,750,000). Except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct of the Company prior to the Effective Time, the aggregate amount of indemnification available to the Parent Indemnified Parties hereunder shall be limited to the Indemnification Escrow Amount. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the rights of any Parent Indemnified Party to seek or obtain injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy to which such Parent Indemnified Party is otherwise entitled. The Liability of the Escrow Participants for indemnification that is not satisfied by the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be several and not joint. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and _Sections 9.05_ and _9.09_ , the procedure for satisfaction of Parent Claims is set forth in the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (b) Except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct of the Company prior to the Effective Time, no Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Damages pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ and _Section 9.02(b)_ (but solely with respect to _Section 9.02(a)_ and  _Section 9.02(b)_) (i) in respect of any claim for Damages that are less than Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) ( _provided_ that claims relating to the same subject matter shall be aggregated for purposes of determining the amount of Damages under this clause (i)), and all such Damages shall be taken into account in determining whether or the extent to which the thresholds set forth in clause (ii) of this paragraph has been met or exceeded, and (ii) unless and until such time as the total amount of all Damages otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to such Sections that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Parent Indemnified Parties, or to which any one or more of the Parent Indemnified Parties has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds On Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000), in which event the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all of such Damages in excess of Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000). 

   ##### 

  

  

 _SECTION 9.05_ _Notification of Certain Claims; Third Party Claims_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.04_: 

   

 (a) If a Parent Indemnified Party is of the opinion that any Parent Claim has occurred or will occur, an authorized officer or representative of such Parent Indemnified Party, as applicable, may so notify the Escrow Participants Representative. Each such notice shall be in writing and shall describe with reasonable specificity, and to the extent known by the applicable Parent Indemnified Party, the nature of such Parent Claim and the amount of Damages related thereto. 

   

 (b) If a Parent Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action audit, demand or assessment (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for Damages under this _Article IX_, Parent will, promptly after receipt of notice of any such Third Party Claim, notify the Escrow Participants Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from a Escrow Participant, such Escrow Participant) of the commencement thereof. The failure to so notify the Escrow Participants Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from a Escrow Participant, such Escrow Participant) of the commencement of any such Third Party Claim will not relieve any Escrow Participant from Liability in connection therewith, except to the extent that such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of such Escrow Participant to defend its interests in such Third Party Claim. If such Third Party Claim does not involve any claims for any injunction, specific performance or any other non-monetary remedy or relief, the Escrow Participants Representative shall have the right, at its election, at any time prior to the end of the 90-day period commencing with the commencement of discovery proceedings related to such Third Party Claim, by delivering a written notice to Parent of such election, to proceed with the defense of such Third Party Claim on its own with counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent. If the Escrow Participants Representative so proceeds with the defense of any such Third Party Claim: (i) the Escrow Participants Representative shall be deemed to have conclusively agreed that all Damages suffered by a Parent Indemnified Party as a result of or in connection with the Third Party Claim are recoverable from the Escrow Participants under this _Article IX_, subject to the provisions of _Section 9.04_; (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to the defense of such Third Party Claim shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Escrow Participants; (iii) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the Escrow Participants Representative reasonable access to properties, documents, materials and employees (subject to the execution of reasonable confidentiality agreements that permit such confidential information to be used in the legal proceedings) to the extent that the Escrow Participants Representative determines in good faith that such access is necessary to the defense of such Third Party Claim; (iv) Parent may, at its own cost and expense, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim; and (v) the Escrow Participants Representative shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such Third Party Claim only with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In addition, the Escrow Participants Representative shall not have the right to assume the control of the defense of any such Third Party Claim and shall be required, at Parents election, to relinquish control of any such defense previously assumed if (i) the amount claimed in such Third Party Claim, in the aggregate with the amount claimed in other Third Party Claims and direct claims against the Escrow Participants asserted as of such time against the Escrow Participants under this _Article IX_, would exceed the limitation of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Escrow Participants liability set forth in _Section 9.04_, or (ii) there
are or may be legal defenses available to Parent that are different from or
additional to those available to the Escrow Participants and that could not
be adequately advanced by counsel to the Escrow Participants Representative,
or if a conflict or potential conflict exists between Parent and the Escrow
Participants Representative that would make having separate representation
advisable for Parent. 

   

 (c) If, with respect to any Third Party Claim described in _Section 9.05(b)_, the Escrow Participants Representative is not permitted to proceed with the defense of such Third Party Claim or is required to cease its control of such Third Party Claim, or does not elect (or has not yet informed Parent in writing that it is electing) to proceed with the defense of any such Third Party Claim, Parent may proceed with the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Escrow Participants Representative. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such Third Party Claim: (i) if it is ultimately agreed or otherwise determined that Parent is entitled to indemnification for Damages resulting from such Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Article IX_, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to the defense of such Third Party Claim shall, subject to _Section 9.04_, be borne and paid exclusively by the Escrow Participants; (ii) the Escrow Participants Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Parent any documents and materials that Parent determines in good faith may be necessary to the defense of such Third Party Claim; (iii) the Escrow Participants Representative may, at its own cost and expense, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim; and (iv) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that if Parent settles, adjusts or compromises any such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Escrow Participants Representative, Parent shall bear the burden of proof to establish the Damages arising as result of such Third Party Claim for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this _Article IX_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _SECTION 9.06_ _Treatment of Adjustments_. The Escrow Participants, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree that all payments made by or on behalf of either of them to or for the benefit of the other (including any payments to the Company) under this _Article IX_ shall be treated as adjustments to the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement for Tax and other purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof. 

  

 _SECTION 9.07_ _No Right of Contribution from Parent, Merger Sub or the Company_. Each Escrow Participant waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Escrow Participant shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, assigns or successors, for any indemnification claims asserted by any Parent Indemnified Parties in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which such Escrow Participant may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement, it being acknowledged and agreed that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Escrow Participants are solely for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties. 

  

 _SECTION 9.08_ _Investigation; No Company Recourse_. The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company Securityholders, the Company or the Escrow Participants Representative in this Agreement, or any document, certificate or other instrument required to be delivered by the Company Securityholders, the Company or the Escrow Participants Representative under this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by any Parent Indemnified Party or any other Person at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any Parent Indemnified Party or any other Person at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

  

 _SECTION 9.09_ _Exclusivity_. Except as a result of Damages that are suffered or incurred by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties or to which any of the Parent Indemnified Parties may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any Third Party Claim or Action), and that arise from or as a result of, or are connected with fraud or intentional misrepresentation or breach of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by the Company, after the Effective Time, the rights to indemnification for Damages set forth in this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent and its Affiliates for any breach of representation or warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be performed of any covenant or agreement made in or pursuant to this Agreement by the Company, and of the Company Securityholders or the Escrow Participants Representative and Parent and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which Parent hereby waives; provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the rights of any Parent Indemnified Party to seek or obtain injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy to which such Parent Indemnified Party is otherwise entitled.

Sub, the Company and the Escrow Participants Representative may designate as
to itself by written notice to the other (in accordance with this _Section
12.02_). 

   

 _SECTION 12.03_ _Release_ . Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Securityholder shall be deemed to have, and hereby does, unconditionally release and forever discharge the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, their Affiliates and their respective agents, representatives, officers and directors, from (a) any and all obligations or duties the Company might have to such Person and (b) any and all claims of Liability, whether legal or equitable, of every kind and nature, which such Person ever had, now has or may claim against the Company in each case arising out of facts or circumstances occurring at any time on or prior to the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that such release shall exclude those claims, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and shall exclude, to the extent applicable with respect to any Person who is a director, officer or employee of the Company, (i) compensation and benefits not yet paid (including any amounts payable in connection with the consummation of the Transactions), (ii) reimbursement for expenses incurred by any such Person in the ordinary course of his or her employment which are reimbursable under the Companys expense reimbursement policies, (iii) accrued vacation, subject to the Companys policies on accrual and carryforward, and (iv) rights to indemnification under the Acquired Companies certificates of incorporation and bylaws or the indemnification agreements listed on Section 6.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule). For the purposes of this _Section 12.03_, each such Person hereby expressly waives the benefits of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (or any Law of similar effect) which reads as follows: 

   

A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release
which if known to him or her must have materially affected his settlement
with the debtor. 

  

 The terms and provisions of this _Section 12.03_ are specific terms of the Transactions, and the approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders pursuant to the Stockholders Written Consent shall constitute approval by such Company Stockholders, as specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable agreement of such Company Stockholders to be bound by such terms and provisions. Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement but for the terms and provisions of this _Section 12.03_. 

  

 _SECTION 12.04_ _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and make reasonable comment upon, any press release or any public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and the consent of the other party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided, however_ , that Parent may make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _SECTION 12.05_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced as a result of any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms and other provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 _SECTION 12.06_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, Schedules and Exhibits and the other agreements referred to herein (including the Ancillary Documents), is complete, and all promises, representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this Agreement relied upon by all the parties hereto, have been expressed herein or in such Company Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits or such other agreements and this Agreement, including such Company Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and such other agreements, supersede any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, to the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof, including that certain Exclusivity Agreement by and between Parent and the Company dated August 10, 2007. Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions hereof are binding upon or enforceable against any party hereto unless and until the same is executed and delivered by all of the parties hereto. 

  

 _SECTION 12.07_ _Successors and Assigns_. All covenants and agreements and other provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs and permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by and Company Securityholder or the Company without the prior written consent of Parent, or assigned by Parent or Merger Sub without the prior written consent of the Company (prior to the Closing) or the Escrow Participants Representative (after the Closing), _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation) may, without obtaining the prior written consent of the Company or the Escrow Participants Representative, assign any of its rights, or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent so long as Parent also remains obligated for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. The Escrow Participants Representative shall execute such acknowledgments of such assignments in such forms as Parent or Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation) may from time to time reasonably request. Any purported assignment or delegation of rights or obligations in violation of this  _Section 12.07_ is void and of no force or effect. 

  

 _SECTION 12.08_ _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto or by a waiver in accordance with _Section 12.09_. Subject to the foregoing and applicable Law, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, after approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company Stockholders and 

   ##### 

  

 

without their further approval, no amendment or waiver shall be made that by
Law requires further approval by the Company Stockholders without such
further approval. 

   

 _SECTION 12.09_ _Waiver_. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 12.08_, each party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other parties or conditions to such parties obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Except where a specific period for action or inaction is provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. The failure of a party to exercise any right conferred herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate with respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or circumstances. 

  

 _SECTION 12.10_ _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement and all of its conditions and provisions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement (except as provided in this _Section 12.10_), express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, including any union or any employee or former employee of the Company, other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement or any provision hereof; _provided, however_ that the Company Indemnified Persons are entitled to the rights and remedies of third party beneficiaries with respect to _Section 6.01_ and the Parent Indemnified Parties not party hereto are entitled to the rights and remedies of third party beneficiaries with respect to _Article IX_. 

  

 _SECTION 12.11_ _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably, and in a manner for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto agrees that the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity. 

  

 _SECTION 12.12_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such State 

   ##### 

  

 

without regard to conflict of laws principles that would result in the
application of any Law other than the Law of the State of New York;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Merger shall be governed by the DGCL. 

   

 _SECTION 12.13_ _Arbitration_. 

   

 (a) All disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or in relation to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be finally resolved by arbitration before one (1) arbitrator selected by Parent and the Escrow Participants Representative; _provided, however_ , that if an arbitrator is not selected within thirty (30) days (or such other period of time as the parties agree in writing) following the date of receipt of the written arbitration demand delivered by the party seeking arbitration to the other party, then Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") shall select an arbitrator from the New York metropolitan area. The arbitration shall be in New York County, New York and shall be administered by JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in such action may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by any applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to process being served by any party to this Agreement in any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in relation to this Agreement or the Transactions by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 12.02_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

   

 (c) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.13_. 

  

 _SECTION 12.14_ _Cumulative Remedies_. All rights and remedies of either party hereto are cumulative of each other and of every other right or remedy such party may otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _SECTION 12.15_ _Representation by Counsel_. Each party hereto represents and agrees with each other that it has been represented by or had the opportunity to be represented by, independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had the full right and opportunity to consult with its respective attorney(s), that to the extent, if any, that it desired, it availed itself of this right and opportunity, that it or its authorized officers (as the case may be) have carefully read and fully understand this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents in their entirety and have had it fully explained to them by such partys respective counsel, that each is fully aware of the contents thereof and its meaning, intent and legal effect, and that it or its authorized officer (as the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement and has executed this Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue influence. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement in connection with the Transactions, with the opportunity to seek advice as to their legal rights from such counsel. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement is to be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof is to arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft hereof. 

  

 _SECTION 12.16_ _Execution and Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be legally binding upon the electronic transmission, including by facsimile or email, by each party of a signed signature page to this Agreement to the other party.

 (c) effective on the Processing Assumption Date, an exclusive right and license under the Indevus Intellectual Property, to make and have made Trospium Once-Daily for use in the Field in the Territory; and 

  

 (d) during the Copromotion Period and any period of time thereafter that Esprit has Promotional Materials that were printed prior to the end of the Copromotion Period and that contain the Indevus Logo, an exclusive (even as to Indevus, subject to Section 2.8) right and license in the Field in the Territory (with the right to grant sublicenses, subject to the provisions of Section 2.5) to use the Indevus Logo on the Promotional Materials solely in accordance with this subsection (d). All representations of the Indevus Logo that Esprit intends to use, if not previously approved by Indevus, will first be submitted to Indevus for approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Indevus will have thirty (30) days to review the representation of the Indevus Logo. If Indevus does not provide written notice of its approval or disapproval (together with its reasons for such disapproval) within such thirty (30) day period, Indevus will be deemed to have approved such representation. 

  

Notwithstanding the rights and licenses granted under Sections 2.1(a), (b) and
(c), Esprit does not expect or anticipate receiving any further Indevus
Intellectual Property subsequent to the NDA Transfer Date, and through the
Agreement Term, as Indevus has represented to Esprit that it believes that it
is remote that after the NDA Transfer Date that Indevus will be performing
any research or development activities which would generate any future
Indevus Intellectual Property related to the licenses granted hereunder with
respect to Product in the Field. Indevus shall not refund any consideration
received from Esprit or pay any penalties if Indevus terminates any or
all development activities which may result in additional Indevus
Intellectual Property on or prior to NDA Transfer Date. 

  

 2.2 Sublicenses of Third Party Rights. 

   

 (a) The licenses granted to Esprit under Section 2.1 include exclusive sublicenses by Indevus in the Field of Indevus rights under the Madaus License and the Supernus Agreement to use, import, offer for sale, and sell Products in and, effective as of the Processing Assumption Date, make Trospium Once-Daily for use in, the Territory.

Esprit, in its sole discretion, may elect to directly pay Madaus or Supernus,
as applicable, any such payment and to offset against any payments due from
Esprit to Indevus under this Agreement an amount equal to such payments made
by Esprit to Madaus or Supernus. Indevus shall use good faith efforts to
obtain the right, including by amendment of the Madaus Agreements and the
Supernus Agreement, for Esprit to make such payments to Madaus and Supernus,
as applicable, as described in and in accordance with this Section 2.2(b).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) as between the Parties,

 (c) In the event that Indevus receives notice from Madaus or Supernus that Indevus has breached the Madaus Agreements (other than the Madaus License and Supply Agreement) or the Supernus Agreement, respectively, which breach gives rise to a right (whether upon further notice, or with or without the passage of time) by Madaus or Supernus, as applicable, to terminate the respective agreement in a way that would terminate or materially adversely affect Esprits ability to perform its obligations or exercise the rights granted to Esprit under this Agreement, Indevus shall notify Esprit of such situation as soon as practicable, and in any event within sixty (60) hours after receipt of such notice, and use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly cure such breach. Provided that Esprit is in compliance with its obligations to pay the applicable Third Party Royalties in accordance with this Agreement, the payments required by Section 14.13(e)(iv) and the portion of Product Procurement Costs described in Section 1.87(e), and is otherwise in material compliance with its obligations hereunder, if Indevus is unable to cure such breach, and Esprit has not materially breached its obligations under this Agreement, Indevus shall, to the extent possible, permit Esprit to cure such breach (and any costs or expenses of Esprit incurred in curing such breach shall, at Esprits election, either be reimbursed by Indevus to Esprit or offset by Esprit against any amounts owed to Indevus under this Agreement). As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, Indevus shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the agreements of each of Madaus and Supernus, as applicable, to grant, in the event that the Madaus Agreements (other than the Madaus License and Supply Agreement) or Supernus Agreement, as applicable, are terminated for any reason and Esprit is in compliance with its obligations to pay the applicable Third Party Royalties in accordance with this Agreement, the payments required by Section 14.13(e)(iv) and the portion of Product Procurement Costs described in Section 1.87(e), and is otherwise in material compliance with its obligations hereunder, substantially equivalent rights on substantially equivalent terms as those granted to Indevus pursuant to the Madaus Agreements (other than the Madaus License and Supply Agreement) or Supernus Agreement, as applicable, as are necessary for Esprit to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except with respect to the payment obligation in Section 6.2(c)(i), Section 14.13(e)(iv), and the portion of Product Procurement Costs described in Section 1.87(e), in no event shall Esprit be responsible for or liable with respect to, or have any obligation to reimburse Indevus in respect of, any payments, claims, demands, actions, causes of action, damages, costs, expenses,

 (C) Upon the occurrence of a Product Adverse Event (1) that is not due to Generic Competition, (2) that does not result in termination by Esprit of all commercialization activities of Esprit with respect to Trospium Once-Daily in the Field in the Territory, and (3) following which, the average Net Sales for the two (2) complete Calendar Quarters commencing immediately after termination of such Product Adverse Event (the "Post Adverse Event Net Sales"), does not equal or exceed the product of (x) the average Net Sales for the two (2) complete Calendar Quarters immediately preceding the commencement of such Product Adverse Event and (y) the sum of the Pro Rated Minimum Royalties for each of the two (2) complete Calendar Quarters immediately after the termination of such Product Adverse Event divided by the sum of the Pro Rated Minimum Royalties for each of the two (2) complete Calendar Quarters immediately preceding the occurrence of such Product Adverse Event, each as calculated from the table set forth in Section 6.2(b)(i) (such product, the "Pre Adverse Event Sales Base"), then the Minimum Royalties set forth in the table in Section 6.2(b)(i) for the Calendar Year in which the Product Adverse Event occurs and for each Calendar Year thereafter shall be reduced as follows: the applicable Minimum Royalties set forth in the table in Section 6.2(b)(i) shall be multiplied by the Post Adverse Event Net Sales and divided by the Pre Adverse Event Sales Base. The Product of such calculation shall be "New Minimum Royalties". Effective as of the termination of such Product Adverse Event, Esprits obligation to satisfy the Minimum Royalties shall be reinstated but such Minimum Royalties shall, for all purposes under this Agreement, be the New Minimum Royalties. In such event, all references herein to the Minimum Royalties shall be deemed to be such New Minimum Royalties and all references herein to the Pro Rated Minimum Royalty or the Minimum Royalty Shortfall shall be calculated based on such New Minimum Royalties.

 (d) For any such legal action or defense, in the event that any Party is unable to initiate, prosecute, or defend such action solely in its own name, the other Party will join such action voluntarily and will execute all documents necessary for the Party to prosecute, defend and maintain such action.

The Parties shall cooperate with each other in obtaining patent term extensions or restorations or supplemental protection certificates or their equivalents in any country in the Territory where applicable and where desired by either Party.

If elections with respect to obtaining such extension or supplemental protection certificates are to be made, Indevus shall have the right but not the obligation to make the election. If Indevus chooses in its sole discretion not to pursue such patent term extension, then at Esprits request Indevus, shall authorize Esprit to act as Indevus agent for the purpose of making any application for any extensions of the term of any such Indevus Patent Rights in the Territory and Indevus shall provide all reasonable assistance therefore to Esprit at Esprits expense.

Esprit shall have the first right to determine in its discretion whether to and to what extent to institute, prosecute and/or defend any action or proceedings involving or affecting any rights relating to the Trademarks in the Territory.

In the event that Indevus brings or assumes control of any such action, then Esprit agrees to reasonably assist Indevus in connection therewith. The Parties shall share equally in all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by either of them in connection with any such action, and, following each Partys recovery of its respective costs and expenses, the Parties will share equally in all money damages, if any, recovered in connection with such action.

The foregoing non-disclosure and non-use obligations shall not apply to the extent that such Proprietary Information: 

   

 (a) is known by the receiving Party at the time of its receipt, and not through a prior disclosure by the disclosing Party, as documented by business records; 

  

 (b) is or becomes properly in the public domain or knowledge without breach by either Party;

investors, lenders, or acquirers; or employees, independent contractors
(including consultants and clinical investigators) or agents, each of whom
prior to disclosure must be bound by written obligations of confidentiality
and non-use no less restrictive than the obligations set forth in this
Article 11 or to counsel for such Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
receiving Party shall (i) undertake reasonable precautions to safeguard and
protect the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information; (ii) remain
responsible for any failure by any Person who receives Proprietary
Information pursuant to this Article 11 to treat such Proprietary Information
as required under this Article 11; and (iii) take all reasonable measures to

proposing to submit such publication shall deliver the proposed publication
or an outline of the oral disclosure at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
planned submission or presentation (twenty-four (24) hours for a meeting

such publication may be delayed such that any issues of patent protection may
be addressed. In the absence of any such request, upon expiration of the
applicable period referred to in this Section 11.4 the publishing Party shall
be free to proceed with the publication or presentation. If the other Party
requests modifications to the publication to prevent disclosure of trade
secret or proprietary business information prior to submission of the
publication or presentation, the publishing Party shall so edit such
publication. The contribution of each Party, if any, shall be noted in all
publications or presentations by acknowledgment or co-authorship, whichever
is appropriate.

Each Party shall have the right to expeditiously (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt) review and recommend changes to any press release or announcement regarding this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ that such right of review and recommendation shall only apply for the first time that specific information is to be disclosed, and shall not apply to the subsequent disclosure of substantially similar information that has previously been disclosed unless there have been material developments relating to Products since the date of the previous disclosure.

the terms of this Agreement from Indevus; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Indevus shall not be obligated under this Section 13.3, to the extent it is
shown by evidence acceptable in a court of law having jurisdiction over the
subject matter and meeting the appropriate degree of proof for such Claim
that the Claim arose out of the negligence or wrongdoing on the part of
Esprit. 

   

 13.4 Indemnification Procedure. 

   

 (a) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any Claim or Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 13.2 or 13.3, as applicable. Concurrent with the provision of notice pursuant to this section, the Indemnified Party shall provide to the other Party copies of any complaint, summons, praecipe, subpoena or other court filings or correspondence related to such Claim and will give such other information with respect thereto as the other Party shall reasonably request. The Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall meet to discuss how to respond to such Claim. Failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve any Party of the duty to defend or indemnify except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of any matter. Each Party agrees that it will take reasonable steps to minimize the burdens of the litigation on witnesses and on the ongoing business of the Indemnified Parties, including making reasonable accommodations to witnesses schedules when possible and seeking appropriate protective orders limiting the duration and/or location of depositions. 

  

 (b) Should either Party dispute that any Claim or portion of a Claim ("Disputed Claim") of which it receives notice pursuant to Section 13.4(a), is an indemnifiable Claim, it shall so notify the other Party providing written notice in sufficient time to permit such other Party to retain counsel and timely appear, answer and/or move in any such action. In such event, such other Party shall defend against such Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such other Party shall not settle any Claim that it contends is an indemnified Claim without providing the Indemnifying Party ten (10) Business Days notice prior to any such settlement and an opportunity to assume the defense and indemnification of such Claim pursuant to this Agreement. If it is determined that a Disputed Claim is subject to indemnification, the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, of the Indemnified Party. 

  

 13.5 Defense of Claims. Esprit shall undertake the defense of any Claims that are not subject to indemnification by Indevus under Section 13.3 ( _provided_ that, if Esprit declines or fails to assume such role, Indevus shall be entitled to assume such role). The Parties shall bear equally all defense costs, including reasonable fees of attorneys, accountants or other experts, as incurred. Indevus shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such Claim utilizing attorneys of its choice, at its own expense. Indevus shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in decision-making with respect to the strategy of such defense, and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the implementation thereof. Esprit shall keep any counsel selected by Indevus reasonably informed of the status and progress of the defense and shall consult with any counsel selected by Indevus on all material aspects of the defense, including settlement, of such Claim, _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Indevus shall have

exclusive control of the defense of any Claim for which an Esprit Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification from Indevus under Section 13.3, (b) any Indevus
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Claim with
respect to such Indevus Indemnified Party, upon written notice to Esprit
pursuant to this Article 13, in which case Esprit shall be relieved of
liability under Section 13.2 for such Claim; and (c) in the event of a Claim
brought against one Party containing allegations of liability based on such
Partys exercise or performing, or failure to exercise or perform any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, such Party shall control and bear
financial responsibility for its own defense, unless the other Party agrees
to control and bear financial responsibility of such defense and Claim. 

   

 13.6 Settlement of Indemnified Claims. The Indemnifying Party under Section 13.2 or 13.3, as applicable, shall have the sole authority to settle any Indemnified Claim without the consent of the other Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that an Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the other Party, as part of any settlement or compromise (a) admit to liability on the part of the other Party; (b) agree to an injunction against the other Party; or (c) settle any matter in a manner that separately apportions fault to the other Party. The Parties further agree that as part of the settlement of any Indemnified Claim, an Indemnifying Party shall obtain a full, complete and unconditional release from the claimant on behalf of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 13.7 Product Liability Claims. Other than Claims for which either Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party under Section 13.2 or 13.3, the following shall apply to Losses arising out of or resulting from any Product Liability Claim, regardless of legal theory. 

   

 (a) Each Party shall give the other prompt written notice of any Product Liability Claim, but failure to provide such prompt notice shall not relieve any Party of the duty to defend or indemnify unless such failure materially prejudices the defense of any matter. With respect to each Product Liability Claim, the Parties shall determine by mutual agreement, within twenty (20) days following their receipt of notice of the commencement of or assertion of such Product Liability Claim (or such lesser period of time as may be required to properly respond to such Product Liability Claim) which Party shall undertake the defense thereof. Should the Parties be unable to agree on who shall undertake the defense of any Product Liability Claim, Esprit shall be entitled to assume such role, _provided_ , _however_ , that absent an agreement by the Parties to the contrary, Indevus shall reimburse Esprit for fifty percent (50%) of defense costs, including reasonable fees of attorneys, accountants or other experts retained by Esprit, as incurred, and if Esprit declines or fails to assume such role, Indevus shall be entitled to assume such role and Esprit shall reimburse Indevus for fifty percent (50%) of defense costs, including reasonable fees of attorneys, accountants or other experts retained by Indevus, as incurred. 

  

 (b) The Party undertaking the defense of any Product Liability Claim (the "Controlling Party") shall consult with the other Party on all material aspects of the defense, including settlement, of such Product Liability Claim, and the other Party shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in decision-making with respect to the strategy of such defense, and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the

implementation thereof. The non-Controlling Party shall also have the right
to participate in the defense of any Product Liability Claim utilizing
attorneys of its choice, at its own expense. In furtherance of the Parties
cooperation, the Controlling Party will consult with the other Party regarding
strategic decisions, including the retention of counsel for defense of any
Product Liability Claim. The Controlling Party will otherwise keep the other
Party reasonably informed of the status and progress of the defense and any
settlement discussions concerning each Product Liability Claim, and the
Parties shall provide each other with all reasonably requested assistance and
will reasonably cooperate with each other in connection therewith. Each Party
agrees that it will take reasonable steps to minimize the burdens of the
litigation on witnesses and on the ongoing business of the Indemnified
Parties including making reasonable accommodations to witnesses schedules
when possible and seeking appropriate protective orders limiting the duration
and/or location of depositions. 

  

 (c) The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to enter into a joint defense agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of any Product Liability Claim which agreement shall, among other things: (i) establish procedures to allocate between the Parties the responsibility for Losses arising out of or resulting from Product Liability Claims (giving effect to, among other factors, the nature of the Product Liability Claim); (ii) establish procedures as are reasonably necessary to permit the Parties to reconcile their actual payments for such Losses with their allocable share of responsibility for such Losses on a quarterly basis; and (iii) provide for procedures with respect to any settlement of a Product Liability Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) to the extent it is shown by evidence acceptable in a court of law having jurisdiction over the subject matter and meeting the appropriate degree of proof for such Product Liability Claim that the Losses resulting from such Product Liability Claim resulted from the manufacture of Products by or through Indevus or its Affiliates or any of their respective employees, agents, contractors, representatives or other persons or entities working on their behalf, then Indevus shall bear financial responsibility for all such Losses, unless Esprit agrees to control and bear financial responsibility of such defense and Product Liability Claim; (y) to the extent it is shown by evidence acceptable in a court of law having jurisdiction over the subject matter and meeting the appropriate degree of proof for such Product Liability Claim that the Losses resulting from such Product Liability Claim resulted from the manufacture of Products by or through Esprit or its Affiliates or any of their respective employees, agents, contractors, representatives or other persons or entities working on their behalf, then Esprit shall bear financial responsibility for all such Losses, unless Indevus agrees to control and bear financial responsibility of such defense and Product Liability Claim; and (z) if the Parties are unable to agree to a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration for resolution. 

  

 (d) Product Liability Claims shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this Section 13.6 and, except in accordance with this Section 13.6, neither Party shall seek from the other Party any indemnity or other recovery on account of any such Product Liability Claims;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 13.6 shall limit either Partys liability to the other Party for damages on account of any breach by such Party of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement.

Each Party shall maintain, commencing as of the Effective Date and for a period of three (3) years after any expiration of termination of this Agreement, a Commercial General Liability Insurance policy or policies (including coverage for Product Liability, Contractual Liability, Bodily Injury, Property Damage and Personal Injury), with minimum limits of [...***...] per occurrence and in the aggregate. Such insurance shall insure against all liability arising out of the manufacture, use, sale, distribution, or marketing of Products in the Territory. During the Agreement Term, each Party shall not permit such insurance to be reduced (other than by payment of Claims), expired or canceled without reasonable prior written notice to the other Party. Upon request each Party shall provide Certificates of Insurance to the other Party evidencing the coverage specified herein. Except as expressly stated herein, a Partys liability to the other is in no way limited to the extent of the Partys insurance coverage. The Parties agree that neither Party shall be deemed to be an additional insured under the terms of their respective insurance policies. The Parties further agree that neither Party shall be deemed to be an additional insured vendor under such policies. 

   

 14. Orders and Supply  

  

 14.1 Orders and Terms of Sale.

Esprit shall notify Indevus in writing of such changes at the time such information is provided by Esprit to its Sales Force. 

   

 14.2 Misdirected Orders. During the Agreement Term, except in the event specifically authorized in writing to do so by Esprit, (a) Indevus will not accept or fill purchase orders for Products in the Field in the Territory and will not process billing or returns with respect to such Products (and in any event Indevus shall have no obligation to do so); and (b) at no time shall Indevus have any power or authority to accept or reject orders on behalf of Esprit. If, for any reason, Indevus receives orders for Products hereunder, Indevus shall forward such orders to Esprit (or if directed by Esprit to Esprits wholesalers) promptly, for acceptance or rejection. 

   

 14.3 Product Returns. If any quantities of Products are returned to Indevus during the Agreement Term, Indevus shall notify Esprit as soon as practicable and ship them to the facility designated by Esprit, with any reasonable or authorized shipping or other documented direct cost to be paid by Esprit.

 14.4 Supply Obligations. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the period beginning on the Execution Date and expiring on the NDA Transfer Date ("Supply Term"), Indevus (or its designees) shall supply to Esprit quantities of Finished Products and/or Samples requested by Esprit in accordance with this Article 14 for use in the Territory, and Esprit shall purchase from Indevus all its requirements of Finished Products and/or Samples at the applicable Supply Price;  _provided_ that, such obligations shall terminate (a) as of the NDA Transfer Date with respect to Trospium Twice-Daily, and (b) as of the Processing Assumption Date with respect to Trospium Once-Daily. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indevus shall, from and after the NDA Transfer Date, (a) continue to have the right, but not the obligation to supply Esprit with Finished Product and Samples of Trospium Twice-Daily, or (b) if so requested by Esprit, use commercially reasonable efforts at any time prior to the NDA Transfer Date to assign to Esprit the Madaus Supply Agreement and Indevus rights and obligations thereunder. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Indevus intends to obtain such Finished Products and Samples through contractual arrangements with Third Party Manufacturers and that Indevus obligations hereunder shall be subject to the terms of its agreements with Madaus, Catalent, and Helsinn and any other Third Party Manufacturer approved by the Parties. The Supply Committee will discuss and address any issues resulting from the failure to meet the requirements of this Section 14.4.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, all Rolling Forecasts shall be terminated as of the Processing Assumption Date, except that Esprit shall continue to be responsible for the Firm Commitment portion of any Rolling Forecast submitted by Esprit to Indevus prior to the Processing Assumption Date. 

  

 (ii) The first three (3) Calendar Quarters with respect to the Initial Trospium Once-Daily Forecast, and the first Calendar Quarter of each Rolling Forecast provided after the launch date of Trospium Once-Daily, shall constitute a firm order for the aggregate quantities of Trospium Once-Daily Finished Product and Samples specified therein and a binding commitment to submit Purchase Orders for the aggregate quantities of Trospium Once-Daily Finished Product and Samples specified therein ("Firm Commitment") and the following Calendar Quarters of each Rolling Forecast shall be non-binding, good faith estimates for planning purposes only and shall not constitute binding commitments by Esprit to purchase Trospium Once-Daily Finished Product and Samples.

Each Purchase Order covering any Firm Commitment portion of a Rolling Forecast shall be for [...***...] quantities of Finished Product and Samples constituting the applicable binding portion, with respect to Trospium Twice-Daily, or the Firm Commitment portion, with respect to Trospium Once-Daily, of the applicable forecasts submitted under Section 14.5. Each Purchase Order shall conform to the terms of this Agreement and shall be consistent with the obligations of Helsinn and Catalent under the Helsinn Agreements and the Catalent Agreements, respectively. Indevus will promptly confirm receipt and acceptance of each such Purchase Order.

shipment and reasonable expectations as to shipment time duration and possible
delays associated therewith. Indevus will deliver or cause to be delivered
all Finished Products and/or Samples to the carrier nominated by Esprit at a
point selected by Indevus. If Esprit nominates a Third Party other than a
carrier to receive the Finished Products and/or Samples, Indevus shall be
deemed to have fulfilled its obligation to deliver the Finished Products
and/or Samples when the Finished Products and/or Samples are delivered to
that Third Party. Title and risk of loss shall transfer to Esprit upon
delivery, F.O.B. to the carrier or Third Party designated by Esprit. For
purposes of this Section 14.7, "Certificate of Analysis and Compliance" means
a document as determined by mutual agreement of the Parties, signed by the
designated quality manager of Indevus or Indevus Third Party Manufacturer,
as applicable, and provided by such Person to Esprit, that sets forth
the analytical test results against the Specifications for a specified Batch
or lot of Finished Products and/or Samples and that certifies that each Batch
or lot of Finished Products and/or Samples was produced and tested in
compliance with the Specifications, cGMPs, the master Batch record and all
applicable FDA Approvals. 

  

 14.8 Supply Price and Payments. 

   

 (a) Invoices and Payments. Except as set forth herein, Indevus shall submit invoices to Esprit for Finished Products and/or Samples promptly after delivery to the carrier or Third Party designated by Esprit under Section 14.7. Payment shall be made in accordance with Section 14.8(b). All relevant terms of Section 6.4 with respect to payments to Indevus hereunder shall apply to the payment of invoices for the supply of Finished Products and/or Samples. Payments hereunder shall be in United States dollars. 

  

 (b) Supply Price. Prior to the Processing Assumption Date with respect to Trospium Once-Daily, and prior to the NDA Transfer Date with respect to Trospium Twice-Daily, Esprit shall purchase Finished Products and/or Samples from Indevus at a purchase price equal to the Product Procurement Costs incurred by Indevus for the applicable Product (the "Supply Price"). The Supply Price shall be established and paid as follows: 

  

 (i) Initial Purchase Orders. Esprit shall pay Indevus on the Effective Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds the Forecasted Supply Price for all quantities of Trospium Once-Daily Finished Product and Samples specified in the Initial Purchase Orders. 

  

 (ii) Forecasted Supply Price. Set forth on Schedule 14.8(b) is a forecasted Supply Price for Finished Products and/or Samples, broken down for Trospium Twice-Daily and Trospium Once-Daily, that shall apply for all quantities of Finished Products and/or Samples of the applicable Product purchased by Esprit from Indevus prior to the Processing Assumption Date (the "Forecasted Supply Price"). By August 31 of each Calendar Year, beginning on August 31, 2008, until the NDA Transfer Date, Indevus shall provide Esprit with an updated Forecasted Supply Price with respect to Trospium Twice-Daily for the following twelve (12) month period. The Parties acknowledge that the Forecasted Supply Price for Finished Products and/or Samples is a good faith estimate of what Indevus believes the average Supply Price will be for Finished Products and/or Samples to be purchased by Esprit during the

applicable twelve (12) month period, based on the forecasts provided and to be
provided by Esprit with respect to the applicable Finished Product and
Samples for the corresponding periods under Section 14.5. Unless otherwise
agreed by the Parties, Esprit shall be invoiced at the Forecasted Supply
Price for all Finished Products and/or Samples purchased by Esprit during
the applicable twelve (12) month period promptly after shipment by Indevus or
its Third Party Manufacturer. Except as set forth in subsection (i) above,
payments of the Forecasted Supply Price shall be made by Esprit within thirty
(30) days after Esprits receipt of the invoice (or, for amounts in dispute
pursuant to Section 14.10(d), within ten (10) days after the date the dispute
is resolved), and shall be subject to the true-up provided for in Section
14.8(b)(iii). 

  

 (iii) True-up of Supply Price. Within sixty (60) days following the Processing Assumption Date with respect to Trospium Once-Daily, and sixty (60) days following August 31, 2008 and each subsequent twelve (12) month period ending August 31 thereafter with respect to Trospium Twice-Daily, Indevus shall provide Esprit a preliminary report estimating Indevus calculation of the actual Supply Price for the aggregate shipments of Finished Products and/or Samples supplied to Esprit for the period covered by such report (the "Actual Shipment Supply Price"), which calculation shall state the amount by which the Forecasted Supply Price for the applicable Product exceeded or was less than the Actual Shipment Supply Price for such shipments. To the extent that volume estimates are needed for such calculation, annualized volumes shall be utilized. In addition, with respect to Trospium Twice-Daily, the report shall include a calculation of the actual quantity of Samples purchased by Esprit for that year as a percentage of the Annual Purchased Amount for that year and any reconciliation caused by the difference between such actual quantity and the quantity of Samples used to determine the Forecasted Supply Price for Trospium Twice-Daily. In the event the Forecasted Supply Price for the applicable Product exceeds the Actual Shipment Supply Price for such period, Esprit shall credit the amount of such deviation from the next payment due Indevus under Section 6.4; _provided_ that Indevus shall reimburse Esprit any amounts not so credited in the event that such amounts are greater than the payments due to Indevus in such payment under Section 6.4. In the event the Forecasted Supply Price for the applicable Product was less than the Actual Shipment Supply Price for such period, Esprit shall pay the amount of such deviation with the next payment due Indevus under Section 6.4. Within thirty (30) days following the end of the first complete Calendar Quarter ending after the date of the preliminary reports referred to above, if there are any deviations from the amounts set forth in the preliminary reports referred to above, Indevus shall provide Esprit with a written report including Indevus final determination of the figures set forth in the preliminary reports referred to above and any deviations from the Actual Shipment Supply Price shall be addressed similarly to the deviations referred to in the preceding two sentences. Upon the expiration or any termination of this Agreement, any then unpaid true-up payments of the Supply Price shall be made by the Party owing such payment to the other Party within thirty (30) days after such expiration or termination. 

  

 (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Esprit shall be permitted to credit against any payments due under Sections 14.8(b)(i)(iii), an amount equal to the Supply Price for commercial quantities of capsules contained in the [...***...] of Trospium Once-Daily manufactured under [...***...] to the extent previously paid with respect to such commercial

quantities, which amounts will be set forth in detail in a report provided by
Indevus concurrently with the first invoice delivered to Esprit pursuant to
Section 14.8(a), and which amounts Indevus acknowledges has been paid as of
the Execution Date. For clarity, such amount shall include the cost of any
packaging and any overhead and additional quality control/quality
assurance work allocated to such commercial quantities, to the extent such
amounts have been previously paid with respect to such commercial quantities
as set forth in such report. 

  

 14.9 Conformity; Specifications; Quality Control. 

   

 (a) All quantities of Finished Products and/or Samples supplied by Indevus pursuant to this Article 14 will conform in all material respects to the Specifications. 

  

 (b) Indevus shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, quality control testing of Finished Products and/or Samples prior to shipment, in accordance with the Specifications as are in effect from time to time and such other quality control testing procedures adopted by Indevus from time to time. 

  

 (c) Each Party shall have the right, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, to inspect and audit all facilities at which Finished Products and/or Samples are manufactured and quality control tested pursuant to this Article 14 for compliance with cGMP, subject to Indevus existing agreements with Third Party Manufacturers. 

  

 (d) The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to enter into a mutually agreeable quality control agreement relating to, (i) prior to the Processing Assumption Date, the supply by Indevus to Esprit under this Agreement of Trospium Once-Daily Finished Products and/or Samples, (ii) prior to the NDA Transfer Date, the supply by Indevus to Esprit under this Agreement of Trospium Twice-Daily Finished Products and/or Samples, and (iii) after the Processing Assumption Date (A) and prior to the NDA Transfer Date, the supply by Esprit under this Agreement of Trospium Once-Daily Finished Products and/or Samples, and (B) if the Ex-US Supply Agreement is entered into, the supply by Esprit to Indevus of Trospium Once-Daily Finished Products and/or Samples or bulk capsules of Trospium Once-Daily prior to being in its finished, labeled and packaged form, for use in jurisdictions outside the Territory. 

  

 14.10 Inspection; Non-conformance. 

   

 (a) Inspection Upon Delivery. Upon receipt of the Finished Products and/or Samples in any shipment, Esprit or its designee may inspect such Finished Products and/or Samples and assay samples thereof. If Esprit finds that any Finished Products and/or Samples delivered to Esprit hereunder fails to meet Specifications upon delivery to Esprit, then Esprit shall provide Indevus with a written notice (the "Non-conformance Notice") within five (5) days after determination of non-conformance and within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Finished Products and/or Samples by Esprit. Esprit shall retain the Finished Products and/or Samples claimed to be non-conforming and Indevus or its designee shall have the right to inspect such Finished Products and/or Samples. In the event Indevus does not respond in writing, within

thirty (30) days after the date of a Non-conformance Notice, Indevus shall be
deemed to be in agreement with Esprits determination of non-conformance. 

  

 (b) Undisputed Claims. Indevus shall, if it agrees with Esprits determination of non-conformance, replace any such non-conforming Finished Products and/or Samples with an equal quantity of Finished Products and/or Samples complying with the Specifications at no additional cost to Esprit and without undue delay; _provided_ that Catalent, Helsinn and Madaus have not breached their respective obligations relating to the supply of Compound, Finished Products and/or Samples, as applicable, under the Catalent Agreements, the Helsinn Agreements, the Madaus Supply Agreement, respectively. Esprit shall dispose of any Finished Products and/or Samples that are not in compliance with the Specifications at Indevus cost, except that Esprit shall follow any reasonable instructions from Indevus to return to Indevus or its designee or otherwise dispose of such non-conforming Finished Products and/or Samples in another manner at Indevus cost. If Indevus is in agreement with the determination of non-conformance, Esprit may credit any amounts representing any charges relating to such non-conforming and replacement Finished Products and/or Samples or receive a refund of any amounts paid. In the event that any Finished Products and/or Samples shipment or Batch thereof is ultimately agreed or found to meet the Specifications, Esprit shall accept and pay for such shipment or Batch. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Processing Assumption Date, Indevus will assume responsibility for all FDA mandated tests for the Finished Products and/or Samples as described in or committed to in the applicable Product NDA. 

  

 (d) Disputed Claims. If Indevus does not agree with Esprits determination of non-conformance, then Indevus shall provide Esprit with a written notice of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Non-Conformance Notice, responding to Esprits claim. The Supply Committee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such disagreement within ten (10) Business Days after Esprits receipt of Indevus notice of disagreement. In the event that the Supply Committee cannot resolve the issue, the Supply Committee shall submit the disputed Finished Products and/or Samples to an independent testing laboratory, to be agreed upon by the Supply Committee, for testing in accordance with the Testing Methods. The findings of such laboratory shall be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error. Expenses of such independent testing shall be borne by either Esprit or Indevus depending on which Partys testing results were in error. Until such time as the disagreement is resolved, no Finished Products and/or Samples from the lot tested shall be released. 

  

 14.11 Inventory Management. Esprit shall maintain inventory of Finished Products and/or Samples in accordance with Esprits usual and customary inventory management practices that Esprit applies to its other products. 

   

 14.12 Shortages; Failure to Supply. If for any reason Indevus shall be, or reasonably believes that it shall be, unable to satisfy Esprits ordered quantities for Finished Products and/or Samples pursuant to Purchase Orders submitted under Section 14.6, then Indevus shall: (a) give Esprit prompt notice thereof, (b) if such failure to supply lasts for a

consecutive [...***...] period, implement Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
remedy such shortage, and (c) if such inability is partial, fulfill firm
orders with such quantities of Finished Products and/or Samples as are
available and shall continue to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
fulfill orders on a timely basis. If Indevus fails to supply on a timely
basis the quantities of Finished Products and/or Samples ordered pursuant to
Section 14.6, in addition to any other remedy available to Esprit, at
Esprits sole discretion and upon notice to Indevus, such shortfall may be
carried over and added to the quantity of such Finished Products and/or
Samples forecasted for the next delivery. Absent any such notice from Esprit,
however, there shall be no such carryover, and Esprit shall not be obligated
to accept a late delivery of shortfall. If Indevus or its Third Party
Manufacturer delivers a greater quantity of Finished Products and/or Samples
than has been ordered, Esprit shall not be obligated to purchase such overage
and, at Indevus option, Esprit may dispose of same or return same to Indevus
or its Third Party manufacturer at Indevus direction and expense.
Esprit shall, however, have the option to treat such overage as an advance
delivery of the next quantity to be delivered or, alternatively, to accept
and pay for such overage. 

   

 14.13 Assumption of Processing Activities. 

   

 (a) On the Processing Assumption Date, Esprit shall be required to assume responsibility for the performance of the Processing Activities in the Territory performed as of the Processing Assumption Date by Indevus (but not its Third Party Manufacturers) in the Territory, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 14.13. Esprit shall provide written notice to Indevus of the Processing Assumption Date at least ninety (90) days prior to the projected Processing Assumption Date. Thereupon, the Parties, in coordination with the Supply Committee, shall establish a plan for Esprit to so undertake such activities, which plan shall include the activities set forth in this Section 14.13. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Indevus shall, prior to or after, as applicable, the Processing Assumption Date, complete the activities set forth on Schedule 14.13(a). 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Esprits assumption of responsibility for the performance of all or any portion of any Processing Activities then being conducted by Indevus or through Catalent and/or Helsinn shall include Esprits assumption of Indevus obligations under the Catalent Agreements and/or Helsinn Agreements with respect to Trospium Once-Daily, including any minimum purchase requirements or obligations or amounts required to be paid by Indevus to Catalent and/or Helsinn, as applicable, in the event of any early termination of the Catalent Agreements or Helsinn Agreements, as applicable. 

  

 (c) Technology Transfer. Promptly following Indevus receipt of Esprits written notice of the Processing Assumption Date and thereafter for at least one hundred twenty (120) days, Indevus shall commence the transfer to Esprit or its designee, or, to the extent permitted under the applicable agreements with Indevus Third Party Manufacturer(s), use reasonable efforts to arrange for the applicable Third Party Manufacturer to commence the transfer to Esprit, of all technical information, regulatory information and other information and materials reasonably necessary for Esprit to assume responsibility for the Processing Activities

under Section 14.13(a), and the Parties shall establish such operational
procedures as are reasonably necessary for Esprit to assume such
responsibility. In connection therewith, Esprit shall agree in writing to the
same confidentiality obligations to which Indevus is then subject with respect
to any such Third Party Manufacturer(s). Such transfer shall include
reasonable time to consult with Indevus technical personnel (and, to the
extent available, its Third Party Manufacturer(s) technical personnel) with
respect to the Processing Activities during the transfer and for a period of
up to six (6) months after the Processing Assumption Date. Indevus shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Third Party Manufacturer(s) to
provide Esprit with such access to such personnel and activities.

If Esprit assumes the rights and obligations of the Helsinn Agreements in their entirety, Espirit will be obligated to supply Indevus under the same terms and condition of the Helsinn Agreements; _provided_ that Indevus shall assign the Helsinn Agreements to Esprit on or before the NDA Transfer Date.

In addition to any payments of the Supply Price for Products shipped prior to the Processing Assumption Date, within thirty (30) days after the Processing Assumption Date, Esprit shall reimburse Indevus for the Supply Price to the extent incurred by Indevus with respect to supply of Products by Third Parties prior to the Processing Assumption Date with respect to Trospium Once-Daily Purchase Orders submitted by Esprit prior to the Processing Assumption Date but for which the Forecasted Supply Price has not yet been paid by Esprit; _provided_ that such Products are held for the

no event shall a charge based on the same inventory be required to be paid
more than once. 

  

 (iii) Unused Inventory of Compound. In addition to any payments required as a result of the true-up of the Supply Price for Finished Products and/or Samples shipped prior to the Processing Assumption Date in accordance with Section 14.8(b), after the Processing Assumption Date, at Indevus request, Esprit shall purchase from Indevus all or any portion of Compound in inventory as of the Processing Assumption Date that meets applicable specifications at a price equal to Indevus Product Procurement Cost for such Compound. For clarity, in no event shall a charge based on the same inventory be required to be paid more than once. 

  

 (iv) Payments to Madaus. After the Processing Assumption Date, Esprit shall continue to be responsible for and shall pay Indevus the payments required to be paid by Indevus to Madaus under Section 3.7(b)(2) of the Madaus License. 

  

 (f) Transfer of Responsibility. Unless and until transfer of the Processing Activities has been transferred to Esprit and Esprit shall have acknowledged in writing to Indevus that Esprit is ready to assume responsibility for such Processing Activities on a specified Processing Assumption Date, Indevus shall remain responsible for such Processing Activities hereunder. Upon Esprits assumption of such Processing Activities, Indevus shall be relieved from all its obligations hereunder as they apply to the Processing Activities. 

  

 14.14 Ex-US Supply Agreement. Indevus shall have the option (the "Ex-US Supply Option") to request that, commencing at any time on or after the Processing Assumption Date, Esprit supply bulk drug product of Trospium Once-Daily, in the form prior to being in its finished and package form and as manufactured for the Territory, to Indevus and/or its designees for jurisdictions outside the Territory. In the event Indevus elects to exercise the Ex-US Supply Option, it shall provide a written notice of such election to Esprit. The Parties shall then negotiate in good faith to enter into the Ex-US Supply Agreement, which shall in any event contain terms and conditions intended to ensure compliance with the supply obligations of Article V of the Madaus License and Supply Agreement, within sixty (60) days after the date of such election notice. 

   

 15. Miscellaneous 

  

 15.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable or responsible to the other Party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached the Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of the Agreement during the period of time when such failure or delay is caused by or results from a Force Majeure event or act, omission or delay in acting by the other Party.

Representative as to the characterization of the investment as a Permitted
Investment, and shall have no liability to ascertain whether or not the
investment is a Permitted Investment. In the absence of such written
directions, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds in the [ _
_ _ _]. The parties acknowledge that shares in this mutual
fund are not obligations of the Escrow Agent, are not deposits and are not
insured by the FDIC. The Escrow Agent or its affiliate may be compensated by
the mutual fund for services rendered in its capacity as investment advisor,
or other service provider, and such compensation is both described in detail
in the prospectus for the fund, and is in addition to compensation, if any,
paid to the Escrow Agent in its capacity as escrow agent hereunder. Until
disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof, Earnings will be deposited into
the Escrow Account and invested with the Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent shall
not be accountable for any losses resulting from the sale or depreciation in
the market value of such investments thereof, unless such loss results from
the Escrow Agents gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. 

   

 SECTION 3. _Tax Treatment and Reporting_. 

  

 (a) The parties hereto agree to treat the Escrow Funds as owned by Parent and not received by the Escrow Participants unless and until paid to the Escrow Participants pursuant to this Agreement, and to file all Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such treatment. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree that, for Tax reporting purposes, Earnings in any Tax year shall be treated as having been realized by the Escrow Participants for United States federal income tax purposes. Unless otherwise required by law, the parties hereto agree that, for United States federal income tax purposes, each Escrow Participant shall report Earnings as its income and shall report related expenses as its expense, in each case in accordance with each Escrow Participants Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall, not later than five (5) Business Days after the end of each calendar quarter, distribute the Earnings for the preceding calendar quarter to the Representative by wire transfer for distribution by the Representative to the Escrow Participants (in accordance with each Escrow Participants Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction). The Escrow Agent annually shall file information returns (if any) with the IRS and provide payee statements to Parent, documenting such Earnings. 

  

 (c) Any disbursement of amounts in the Escrow Account to Escrow Participants shall be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as consisting, in part, of imputed interest in accordance with the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Escrow Agent shall timely file information statements with the IRS and provide payee statements to Escrow Participants documenting each Escrow Participants share of the imputed interest or any payment made hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall inform Parent that the Escrow Agent filed such information returns and provided such payee statements. 

  

 (d) Parent and the Escrow Participants agree to provide the Escrow Agent with any forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may reasonably request to complete any information returns and payee statements (collectively, the " _Tax Reporting Documentation_ "), prior to any distribution to Parent or the Escrow Participants. The parties hereto understand that, in the event the Tax Reporting Documentation is not provided to the Escrow Agent, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may require withholding of a portion of any imputed interest or other payments made to Parent or the Escrow Participants. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all 

     ##### 

  

 

purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Parent or the Escrow
Participants, as appropriate, in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Escrow Agent. 

   

 SECTION 4. _Net Working Capital Escrow Fund_. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a written notice from Parent or the Representative setting forth how the Net Working Capital Escrow Amount is to be distributed and released, accompanied by either (i) an executed written agreement between Parent and the Representative with respect to such distribution and release or (ii) a written decision of the Accounting Firm with respect to such distribution and release, the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay to Parent from the Net Working Capital Escrow Amount and, to the extent the Net Working Capital Escrow Amount is insufficient, the Indemnification Escrow Amount, the Closing Net Working Capital Shortage, if any, and release any remaining portion of the Net Working Capital Escrow Amount from the Escrow Account to the Representative by wire transfer for disbursement by the Representative to each Escrow Participant based on such Escrow Participants Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction. 

  

 SECTION 5. _Indemnification Escrow Fund_. 

  

 (a) _Notices of Claims and Dispute Notices_. 

   

 (i) With respect to any Parent Claim that Parent reasonably believes exists, or reasonably believes will exist, Parent may deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice (a " _Notice of Claim_ "), which shall set forth in reasonable detail (to the extent known) the nature of such Parent Claim and an estimate of the aggregate amount to which Parent believes it is at that time, or will be, entitled to be paid out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Parent shall send a copy of the Notice of Claim to the Representative at the same time that it sends such Notice of Claim to the Escrow Agent. 

   

 (ii) The Escrow Agent may liquidate any Permitted Investment in order to make available a sufficient portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, if and as necessary, and shall pay to Parent, or such Person designated by Parent, therefrom the amount set forth in a Notice of Claim as soon as practicable, but no earlier than thirty one (31) days following receipt by the Escrow Agent of such Notice of Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if within the period of thirty (30) days following receipt by the Escrow Agent of such Notice of Claim, the Escrow Agent shall have received from the Representative a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") stating that the Representative disputes the validity or the amount specified in such Notice of Claim or any portion thereof (a " _Disputed Amount_ ") and providing in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, the Escrow Agent shall not pay any such Disputed Amount (but shall pay any amount specified in such Notice of Claim that is not in dispute) to Parent, or such Person designated by Parent, other than pursuant to Section 3(b) of this Agreement. The Representative shall send a copy of each Dispute Notice to Parent at the same time that the Representative sends such Dispute Notice to the Escrow Agent. 

   

 (iii) If the Escrow Agent shall not have received a Dispute Notice with respect to the amount specified in a Notice of Claim, or a portion thereof, within the period of thirty (30) days following its receipt of such Notice of Claim, the Representative and the Escrow Participants shall be forever barred and precluded from contesting in any manner 

     ##### 

  

   

or forum whatsoever the distribution of the Escrow Funds on account of such
amount not so disputed (except to dispute the delivery by Parent of a Notice
of Claim to the Representative), and the Escrow Agent shall pay such amount
to Parent, or such Person designated by Parent in writing, in accordance with
the preceding paragraph (ii) of this Section 5(a). 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow Agent may pay to Parent, or any Person designated by Parent in writing, the amount set forth in a Notice of Claim earlier than thirty (31) days following receipt by the Escrow Agent of such Notice of Claim, _provided_  that the Parent delivers to the Escrow Agent a Notice of Claim executed by both Parent and the Representative authorizing the Escrow Agent to release such specified amount of the Escrow Funds to Parent. In the event that the Representative authorizes the Escrow Agent to release such specified amount of the Escrow Funds by executing a Notice of Claim with Parent, the Representative and the Escrow Participants shall be forever barred and precluded from contesting in any manner or forum whatsoever the distribution of the Escrow Funds on account of such amount. 

  

 (b) _Disputed Amounts_. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a written notice (a " _Resolution Notice_ ") from Parent and/or the Representative with respect to a Disputed Amount specifying the amount of such Disputed Amount to which Parent is entitled, accompanied by either (i) an executed written agreement between Parent and the Representative with respect to such Disputed Amount or (ii) an award, judgment, decree or order of the arbitrators pursuant to Section 5(c) below, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent, or such Person designated by Parent, from the Indemnification Escrow Amount the amount to which Parent is entitled, if any. 

  

 (c) _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of a Disputed Amount, the Parent and the Representative shall in good faith negotiate to settle such Disputed Amount. If no resolution is reached within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice to the Escrow Agent, either party may demand arbitration of the dispute pursuant to Section 12.13 of the Merger Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be written and shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order of the arbitrator. Judgment upon any such award, judgment, decree or order may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The non-prevailing party in any such arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator, shall bear all fees, costs and expenses related to such arbitration, including the reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred by the other party. 

  

 (d) _Release of the Indemnification Escrow Fund_. 

   

 (i) On the date that is nine (9) months after the date of this Agreement (the " _First Distribution Date_ "), the Escrow Agent will release to the Representative by wire transfer for distribution by the Representative to the Escrow Participants (in accordance with each Escrow Participants Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction) the positive difference, if any, between (A) the Indemnification Escrow Amount and (B) the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of the payments, if any, previously made to Parent, the Escrow Participants or the Escrow Agent out of the Escrow Funds (other than pursuant to Section 3(b) or Section 4) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (ii) any amounts that the Escrow Agent is required to pay but has not yet paid to Parent or a Person designated by Parent, pursuant to Sections 5(a) or 5(b), (iii) the Withheld Amounts (as defined below) as of the First Distribution Date, and (iv) Thirteen Million Eight Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($13,875,000). As soon as practicable, after the First Distribution 

     ##### 

  

   

Date, the Escrow Agent will release such funds, if any, to the
Representative by wire transfer for distribution by the Representative to
each Escrow Participant in accordance with each Escrow Participants
Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction. The term " _Withheld Amounts_ "
shall mean the aggregate amount of (x) all Disputed Amounts not paid or
otherwise resolved by such date and (y) all other amounts specified in
Notices of Claims received by the Escrow Agent as of such date and not paid
as of such date from the Escrow Funds unless, as of such date, the Escrow
Agent is required to pay such amounts pursuant to Sections 5(a) or 5(b). The
amounts described in clause (B)(ii) of this Section 5(d)(i) shall be paid by
the Escrow Agent to Parent, or a Person designated by Parent, pursuant to
Sections 5(a) or 5(b) as the case may be, and the amounts described in
clause (B)(iii) of this Section 5(d)(i) shall remain Escrow Funds held by,
and to be paid out by, the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. 

   

 (ii) On the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date of this Agreement (the " _Second Distribution Date_ "), the Escrow Agent will release to the Representative by wire transfer for distribution by the Representative to the Escrow Participants (in accordance with each Escrow Participants Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction) the positive difference, if any, between (A) any amount remaining in the Escrow Account and (B) the sum of (i) any amounts that the Escrow Agent is required to pay but has not yet paid to Parent or a Person designated by Parent, pursuant to Sections 5(a) or 5(b), and (ii) the Withheld Amounts as of the Second Distribution Date.

 (iv) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent after First Distribution Date but prior to the Second Distribution Date of a written notice from Parent or the Representative that any claims as to all or any portion of the Withheld Amounts as of the First Distribution Date have been resolved (" _Resolved Withheld Amounts_ "), accompanied by (A) an executed written agreement between Parent and the Representative with respect to such Resolved Withheld Amounts or (B) an award, judgment, decree or order of the arbitrator pursuant to Section 5(c) with respect to such Withheld Amounts, the Escrow Agent shall release such Resolved Withheld Amounts from the Escrow Account, as instructed in the joint written notice or order, to Parent or to the Representative by wire transfer for distribution by the Representative to each Escrow Participant in accordance with each Escrow Participants Aggregate Proceeds Contribution Fraction (as set forth on the Transaction Schedule attached hereto as _Schedule A_), _provided, however_ , that the Escrow 

     ##### 

  

   

Agent shall only release to the Representative such portion of such
Resolved Withheld Amounts due the Representative, if any, that does not
exceed (X) Thirteen Million Eight Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Dollars
($13,875,000) _minus_ (Y) the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of the
payments, if any, previously made to Parent, the Escrow Participants or the
Escrow Agent out of the Escrow Funds (other than pursuant to Section 3(b) or
Section 4) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (ii) any amounts
that the Escrow Agent is required to pay but has not yet paid to Parent
(including such portion of the Resolved Withheld Amounts, if any, and to the
extent not already paid) or a Person designated by Parent, pursuant to
Sections 5(a) or 5(b), and (iii) any other Withheld Amounts; _provided_ ,

 (b) The Escrow Agent may resign as escrow agent by notice to the other parties hereto (the " _Resignation Notice_ ") effective upon appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. If, prior to the expiration of sixty (60) Business Days after the delivery of the Resignation Notice, the Escrow Agent shall not have received written instructions from Parent and the Representative designating a banking corporation or trust company organized either under the 

     ##### 

  

 

laws of the United States or of any state as successor escrow agent and
consented to in writing by such successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent may
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow
agent. Alternatively, if the Escrow Agent shall have received such written
instructions, it shall promptly transfer the Escrow Funds to such successor
escrow agent. Upon the appointment of a successor escrow agent and the
transfer of the Escrow Funds, and any other records, including without
limitation, tax-related information, relating to the Escrow Funds or this
Agreement by the resigning Escrow Agent to the successor escrow agent, the
duties of such resigning Escrow Agent hereunder shall terminate. 

   

 (c) Each of Parent and the Representative hereby agrees to pay the Escrow Agent reasonable compensation for its services hereunder in accordance with the " _Schedule of Fees_ " attached hereto as _Schedule A_ and to reimburse the Escrow Agent for all expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by it in the performance of its duties hereunder and to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any and all taxes, expenses (including reasonable counsel fees), assessments, liabilities, claims, damages, actions, suits or other charges incurred by or assessed against it for anything done or omitted by it in the performance of its duties hereunder, except as a result of its own gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. Parent and the Representative, on behalf of the Escrow Participants, shall share equally in all payments owing under this Section 6(c), although liability for such payments if not paid in a timely manner shall be the responsibility of the party responsible therefore. The Representatives portion of such payments shall be funded from the Escrow Fund (without any requirement of any written instruction or directive from the Representative), and Parent agrees to execute a Notice of Claim pursuant to Section 5(a) of this Agreement authorizing the Escrow Agent to release such portion of the Representatives payments to the Escrow Agent. The agreement contained in this Section 6(c) shall survive any termination of the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder. 

  

 (d) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities, including, without limitation, a duty to review or interpret the Merger Agreement, except those expressly set forth herein, and no implied duties shall be read into this Agreement. It may consult with counsel, shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or omitted in good faith on advice of counsel and shall have no liability hereunder except for gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility as to the validity, collectibility or value of the Escrow Funds or for investment losses related thereto, provided the Escrow Funds have been invested in accordance with Section 2 above, and it may rely on any notice, instruction, certificate, statement, request, consent, confirmation, agreement or other instrument which it reasonably believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by a proper person or persons. If the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions from any of the undersigned with respect to the Escrow Funds, which, in its opinion, are in conflict with any of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by the other parties hereto or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any other agreement between any of the parties hereto, the Escrow Agent shall have no interest in the Escrow Funds except as provided in this Escrow Agreement and shall hold such funds in trust in accordance herewith. 

  

 (e) All notices, consents and other communications under this Escrow Agreement shall be in writing and shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be deemed to have been 

     ##### 

  

 

received when (i) delivered by hand, (ii) sent by facsimile (with receipt

Nothing contained in this General Release shall be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect the right of any Releasee to raise this General Release as a
defense in any legal proceeding in any other forum or jurisdiction.

1\. Delivery of Letter of Transmittal. The properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documents required by this
Letter of Transmittal, including the Surrendered Certificate(s) must be
received by Payment Agent for delivery to be effected and the appropriate
person to be entitled to receive the consideration set forth in the Merger
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, Payment will be
delivered in exchange for Surrendered Certificate(s) only after receipt by

and all other required documents, including the Surrendered Certificate(s). 

   

 All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of the Surrendered Securities hereunder or delivery by the holder(s) of this Letter of Transmittal shall be determined by Payment Agent and Parent. Parent reserves the absolute right to reject any Surrendered Certificate or Letter of Transmittal not in proper form or the acceptance of which may, in the judgment of counsel for Parent, be unlawful. Parent also reserves the absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity in the surrender of any Surrendered Certificate or delivery of any Letter of Transmittal, and its interpretations of other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and this Letter of Transmittal (including these instructions) with respect to such irregularities or defects shall be final and binding. Neither Parent (nor any of its affiliates) nor any other person will be under any duty to give notice of any defects or irregularities in any Letter of Transmittal or Surrendered Certificate nor will such parties incur any liability for failure to give any notice to any person (even if such notice is given to other persons). 

  

 The method of delivery of the Letter of Transmittal and all other required documents, including any Surrendered Certificate(s), is at the election of the surrendering holder(s), but risk of loss and title to the Surrendered Certificate(s) will pass only upon delivery of the Surrendered Certificate(s) to Payment Agent. If delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended. 

 

2\. Guarantee of Signatures. No signature on this Letter of Transmittal is
required to be guaranteed if (i) this Letter of Transmittal (or a
reproduction hereof) is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Surrendered
Securities and the signature(s) correspond exactly with the name(s)
as written on the face(s) of the Surrendered Certificate(s) _unless_ such

8\. Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies. Requests for assistance may
be directed to, and additional copies of this Letter of Transmittal may be
obtained from ___ by contacting ___ at (XXX) XXX-XXXX or ___ at (XXX) XXX-
XXXX. 

  

9\. Substitute Form W-9; Form W-8. Under federal income tax laws, each Company
Stockholder surrendering any Surrendered Securities is required to provide
Parent with a correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on Substitute
Form W-9, which is provided under "Important Tax Information," and to
indicate if such Company Stockholder is not subject to backup withholding
by signing and dating the Substitute Form W-9. Failure to provide the
information on the form may subject the surrendering holder(s) to a $50
penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service and the Payment will be
subject to backup withholding taxes of 28%. See "Important Tax Information"
below. Please consult your accountant or tax advisor for further guidance in
completing the Substitute Form W-9. A non-U.S. Company Stockholder that
certifies its non-U.S. status by completing an appropriate IRS Form W-8 will
not be subject to backup withholding and will not need to complete a Form
W-9. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
appropriate Form W-8 (which can be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service
web site at _http://www.irs.gov_ or by contacting the Payment Agent) and any
other forms that may be required. 

  

10\. Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates. If the Company issued to you any
certificate(s) representing your shares of Company stock and any such
certificate has been lost, mutilated, destroyed or stolen (the "Lost
Certificate"), the holder should promptly notify the Payment Agent in
writing, at the address set forth on the first page of this Letter of
Transmittal. An affidavit of that fact, a completed Letter of Transmittal and
any related documents should accompany the written notice of a lost,
mutilated, destroyed or stolen Company stock certificate; however, it cannot
be processed until the procedures for replacing the lost, mutilated, destroyed
or stolen certificate have been followed. The holder will then be instructed
as to the steps that must be taken in order to replace such certificate. In
order to receive Payment, the Payment Agent will require holders who have
lost their certificate(s) to post a bond as an indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Payment Agent with respect to such Lost
Certificate. The bond fee is 2% of the cash value of the Company stock plus a
$60 handling fee. 

      ##### 

  

 

11\. Important Tax Information. Under federal income tax law, a Company
Stockholder surrendering any Surrendered Securities is required to provide
Parent with such Company Stockholders correct Taxpayer Identification Number
(TIN) on Substitute Form W-9 below. If such Company Stockholder is an
individual, the TIN is the Company Stockholders social security number. If
Parent is not provided with the correct TIN, the Company Stockholder may be
subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. In
addition, any Payment made to such Company Stockholder may be subject to
backup withholding. Certain Company Stockholders (including, among others,
all corporations and certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these
backup withholding and reporting requirements. In order for a foreign
individual to qualify as such an exempt recipient, such Company Stockholder
must submit a statement signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to such
Company Stockholders exempt status. Such statements can be obtained from the
Payment Agent, attention: ___ (XXX) XXX-XXXX or from the Internal Revenue
Service at http://www.irs.gov. See the enclosed Guidelines for Certification
of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional
information. If backup withholding applies, Parent is required to withhold
28% of any cash amounts otherwise payable to the applicable
Company Stockholder. Backup withholding is not an additional tax; rather, the
tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the
amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a
refund may be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service. 

   

Please consult your accountant or tax advisor for further guidance 

  

in completing the Substitute Form W-9.

    

Purpose of Substitute Form W-9 

   

 To prevent backup withholding on cash payments that are made to a Company Stockholder with respect to Surrendered Securities surrendered for payment, the Company Stockholder is required to notify Payment Agent of his or her current TIN by completing the form below certifying that such holder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien), that the TIN provided on Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or that such holder is awaiting a TIN) and that (i) such Company Stockholder is exempt from backup withholding, (ii) such Company Stockholder has not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that he or she is subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to report all interest or dividends or (iii) the Internal Revenue Service has notified such Company Stockholder that he or she is no longer subject to backup withholding. 

  

What Number to Give 

   

 Each Company Stockholder is required to give Parent the social security number or employer identification number of the record holder(s) of the Surrendered Securities. If a Surrendered Certificate is in more than one name or is not in the name of the actual holder, consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for guidance on which number to report.

What Number to Give 

   

 Each Company Stockholder is required to give Parent the social security number or employer identification number of the record holder(s) of the Surrendered Securities. If a Surrendered Certificate is in more than one name or is not in the name of the actual holder, consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for guidance on which number to report.
