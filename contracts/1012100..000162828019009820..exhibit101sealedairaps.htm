iii EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
30th day of April, 2019, among Sealed Air Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Buyer"), Automated Packaging Systems, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the
"Company"), APS Holding Company, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Seller"),
each of the Persons identified in Section 4.2(a) of the Disclosure Letter
(each, a "Stockholder," and collectively with the Seller, the "Seller
Parties"), and the Seller, in its capacity as Sellers' Representative
("Sellers' Representative").

RECITALS:

Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Stockholders formed the Seller
and caused the Seller to make an election to be taxed as an "S Corporation."
Following the execution of this Agreement, the following transactions will
occur in the order set forth herein: (1) the Stockholders will contribute all
of the shares of capital stock in the Company to the Seller (with the result
that the Company will become taxed as a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary"
for federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes); and (2) the
Company will convert from an Ohio corporation to an Ohio limited liability
company and change its name to Automated Packaging Systems, LLC (for the
avoidance of doubt, all references in this Agreement to the Company shall
include Automated Packaging Systems, Inc. and its successor Automated
Packaging Systems, LLC unless expressly provided otherwise). Polyrol Packaging
Systems, Inc. will also convert from an Ohio corporation to an Ohio limited
liability company and change its name to Polyrol Packaging Systems, LLC. The
transactions described in the preceding sentences shall, collectively, be
referred to as the "Pre-Closing Transactions."

Immediately after the occurrence of the Pre-Closing Transactions and
continuing until the Closing, (i) the Stockholders will collectively hold all
of the outstanding equity of the Seller and (ii) the Seller will own all of
the outstanding equity of the Company, comprised of 100% of the issued and
outstanding limited liability company interests of the Company (the "LLC
Interests").

Buyer will purchase from the Seller, and the Seller will sell to Buyer, the
LLC Interests, upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Buyer, the Company, the Seller Parties and Sellers'
Representative, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as set forth
herein.

ARTICLE 1 
Definitions

1.1 Definitions. Certain terms used in this Agreement have the meanings set
forth in Article 10, or elsewhere herein as indicated in Article 10.



1 1.2 Accounting Terms. Accounting terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings attributed to them under GAAP,
except as may otherwise be specified herein.

ARTICLE 2 
Purchase and Sale

2.1 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in reliance upon the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, free and clear of any Liens, and Buyer
shall purchase and acquire from the Seller, all of the Seller's right, title
and interest in and to all of the LLC Interests.

2.2 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for
all of the LLC Interests is an amount equal to:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Five Hundred Ten Million Dollars ($510,000,000); 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

plus an amount equal to the Closing Cash; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

minus an amount equal to the Closing Indebtedness; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the
Working Capital Target, or minus the amount, if any, by which the Working
Capital Target exceeds the Closing Working Capital; 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

minus an amount equal to the Transaction Bonuses; and 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

minus an amount equal to the Selling Expenses. 

2.3 Estimated Purchase Price; Payments at the Closing.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days before the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company will estimate in good faith the amount of the Closing Cash, the
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital, the Transaction Bonuses and
the Selling Expenses, respectively, and deliver to Buyer a certificate (the
"Closing Certificate") setting forth those estimates and the calculation of
the Estimated Purchase Price, along with reasonable supporting detail, the
estimates and calculations to be prepared in a manner consistent with the
Accounting Policies and in accordance with the applicable definitions in this
Agreement. With respect to amounts of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness,
Selling Expenses, Transaction Bonuses and Closing Working Capital appearing on
the Closing Certificate that may otherwise be expressed in a currency other
than U.S. dollars, the parties agree that, in converting such amounts to U.S.
dollars for inclusion on the Closing Certificate, the FX Rate will be used as
of three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Certificate Delivery Date. As
used herein, "Estimated Closing Cash," "Estimated Closing Indebtedness,"
"Estimated Closing Working Capital," "Estimated Transaction Bonuses" and
"Estimated Selling Expenses" mean the estimates of the Closing Cash,



2 the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital, the Transaction Bonuses
and the Selling Expenses, respectively, set forth in the Closing Certificate,
and "Estimated Purchase Price" means an amount equal to the Purchase Price
calculated as set forth in Section 2.2, assuming for purposes of the
calculation that the Closing Cash is equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, that
the Closing Indebtedness is equal to the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, that
the Closing Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Closing Working Capital,
that the Transaction Bonuses are equal to the Estimated Transaction Bonuses
and that the Selling Expenses are equal to the Estimated Selling Expenses.

(b) During the period between the delivery of the Closing Certificate and the
Closing Date, at the reasonable request of Buyer, the Seller and Sellers'
Representative will, and will cause the Acquired Companies to, cause the books
and records of the Acquired Companies used by the Company in the preparation
of the Closing Certificate to be made available during normal business hours
to Buyer and its representatives, upon reasonable advance notice. The Seller
and Sellers' Representative shall consider in good faith any comments from
Buyer and shall revise the Closing Certificate to reflect any such comments
that are agreed among the parties (and, in any event, shall revise the Closing
Certificate to correct any manifest or clerical error); provided, that (i) for
the avoidance of doubt, the Seller and Sellers' Representative shall not be
under any obligation to revise the Closing Certificate except as specifically
set forth above, and (ii) any failure of Buyer to comment on the Closing
Certificate prior to the Closing Date shall not preclude Buyer from exercising
any other rights under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, payment by
Buyer of any amount set forth in the Closing Certificate shall not be deemed
to be an acceptance by Buyer of the Company's calculations in the Closing
Certificate or waiver of any of Buyer's rights under this Agreement.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
Buyer shall pay and deliver, or cause to be paid and delivered, the following
amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds into the account or
accounts designated by each of the following recipients (which accounts are
designated at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date):

(i) the Estimated Purchase Price, less the sum of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
and the Sellers' Representative Holdback Amount (the "Closing Cash Payment"),
to the Seller by means of a wire transfer to an account as directed by
Sellers' Representative (the "Sellers' Account");

(ii) the Sellers' Representative Holdback Amount to the Sellers' Account, to
be held by Sellers' Representative for a term determined by Sellers'
Representative, in Sellers' Representative's reasonable discretion, to fund
any post-Closing fees, expenses or other obligations of the Seller Parties or
Sellers' Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers' Representative
Holdback Amount shall not be held on behalf of Buyer and shall be deemed, for
all purposes, to have been paid by Buyer to the Seller at the Closing);



3 (iii) the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent, to be held pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

(iv) the Estimated Closing Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies identified
in Section 2.3(c)(iv) of the Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Repaid
Closing Indebtedness"), on behalf of the Acquired Companies, to the Persons
entitled thereto (or, at the Company's written direction, to an Acquired
Company for payment to the Persons entitled thereto);

(v) the Estimated Selling Expenses, on behalf of the Acquired Companies, to
the Persons entitled thereto (or, at the Company's written direction, to an
Acquired Company for payment to the Persons entitled thereto); and

(vi) the Estimated Transaction Bonuses, on behalf of the Acquired Companies,
to an Acquired Company for payment to the Persons entitled thereto.

2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment.

2.4.1 Adjustment Statement Preparation. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers' Representative an
adjustment statement setting forth Buyer's written, good faith determination
and calculation of the amount of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness,
the Closing Working Capital, the Transaction Bonuses and the Selling Expenses,
respectively (the "Preliminary Adjustment Statement"), and, based on the
Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital, the
Transaction Bonuses and the Selling Expenses as derived therefrom, Buyer's
written, good faith determination and calculation of the Purchase Price and
the adjustment necessary to reconcile the Estimated Purchase Price to the
Purchase Price (the "Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment"). The Preliminary
Adjustment Statement and the Final Adjustment Statement will be prepared in a
manner consistent with the Accounting Policies and in accordance with the
applicable definitions in this Agreement. With respect to amounts of Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Selling Expenses, Transaction Bonuses and Closing
Working Capital appearing on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
Final Adjustment Statement that may otherwise be expressed in a currency other
than U.S. dollars, the parties agree that, in converting such amounts to U.S.
dollars for inclusion on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Final
Adjustment Statement, the FX Rate will be used as of one (1) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date. In preparing the Preliminary Adjustment Statement:
(a) any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of any of the Acquired
Companies of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into by Buyer
at any time on or after the Closing Date are to be entirely disregarded; (b)
it will be assumed that the Acquired Companies and their respective lines of
business are continued as a going concern; and (c) none of the plans,
transactions or changes that Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be
initiated or made after the Closing Date with respect to any of the Acquired
Companies or its or their respective business or assets, or any facts or
circumstances that are unique or particular to Buyer or any assets or
liabilities of Buyer, or any obligation for the payment of the Purchase Price
will be taken into account.



4 2.4.2 Adjustment Statement Review. Sellers' Representative, on behalf of all
of the Seller Parties, will review the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and
the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment and, if Sellers' Representative
determines that either was not prepared in accordance with Section 2.4.1,
Sellers' Representative will so notify Buyer in writing no later than thirty
(30) days after Sellers' Representative's receipt of the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement, setting forth in the notice Sellers' Representative's
objection or objections to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement or the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment with reasonable particularity and the
adjustments that Sellers' Representative claims are required to be made in
order to conform to the terms of Section 2.4.1, together with reasonable
supporting detail for Sellers' Representative's objection or objections and
related adjustments. Any items or amounts not specifically indicated in such
written notice delivered to Buyer by Sellers' Representative will be deemed to
have been irrevocably accepted by Sellers' Representative and will be final
and binding on the parties. Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies and their
respective officers, employees, agents and representatives to provide
reasonable cooperation with the accountants and advisors of the Seller
(including Sellers' Representative) in the review of the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
will cause the books and records of the Acquired Companies used by the
Acquired Companies in the preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
to be made available during normal business hours to these representatives,
and will cause the necessary personnel of the Acquired Companies to reasonably
assist these representatives in their review of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement, including by granting them reasonable access to the applicable
books and records of the Acquired Companies, in each case, upon reasonable
advance notice. The fees and expenses of the accountants and advisors retained
by Sellers' Representative will be paid by Sellers' Representative.

2.4.3 Adjustment Statement Dispute Resolution. If Sellers' Representative
timely notifies Buyer in accordance with Section 2.4.2 of an objection to the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement or the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment,
and if Buyer and Sellers' Representative are unable to resolve any disputed
items or amounts through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days after
Sellers' Representative's delivery of the written notice of objection, then
either party may elect to have the parties engage and submit any such
remaining disputed items or amounts to, and the same will be finally resolved
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by, Deloitte LLP, or if
this firm is unable or unwilling to act, another nationally recognized,
independent, public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Sellers'
Representative and Buyer in writing (which does not have any material
relationship with Buyer, the Seller or Sellers' Representative) (the
"Independent Accountants"). Buyer and Sellers' Representative will have the
opportunity to present in writing their positions on the disputed matters to
the Independent Accountants in accordance with the requirements of this
Section 2.4. The Independent Accountants will determine and report in writing
to Buyer and Sellers' Representative as to the resolution (and the basis for
such resolution) of all disputed matters submitted to the Independent
Accountants (including its determination of the Final Adjustment Statement,
Final Post-Closing Adjustment and the components thereof, in each case to the
extent in dispute) and the effect of its determinations on the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment within twenty
(20) days after the submission or a longer period as the Independent
Accountants may reasonably require. The



5 determinations by the Independent Accountants will be final, binding and
conclusive as to Buyer, the Seller Parties, Sellers' Representative and their
respective Affiliates upon which a judgment may be rendered by a court having
proper jurisdiction over the party against which the determination is to be
enforced. With respect to each disputed item, the Independent Accountants will
adopt a position that is either equal to Buyer's proposed position, equal to
Sellers' Representative's proposed position, or between the positions proposed
by Buyer and Sellers' Representative. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accountants will be borne by the party (i.e., Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Seller Parties), on the one hand, and Buyer,
on the other hand) that assigned an aggregate amount to items in dispute that
was, on a net basis, furthest in amount from the amount finally determined by
the Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants shall include the
apportionment of its fees and disbursements in its report to Buyer and
Sellers' Representative.

2.4.4 Actuarial Adjustment.

(a) Within 14 days (or such longer period as agreed between Buyer and Seller)
following the triggering of the wind-up of the Automated Packaging Systems
Pension Plan as required under Section 8.6.3, the Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a statement of the assets and liabilities of the Automated Packaging
Systems Pension Plan obtained from the actuary for the Automated Packaging
Systems Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan Actuary"), by reference to the annuity
buy out cost for all beneficiaries of such Plan in respect of their full
entitlements, taking into account all legal and trust requirements, in all
cases in accordance with section 75 and 75A of the Pensions Act 1995, as
amended (the "Actuarial Statement"). Upon Buyer's request, the Seller shall
provide any independent actuary designated by Buyer (the "Buyer's Actuary")
with the Actuarial Statement and any information necessary to calculate the
assets and liabilities of the Automated Packaging Systems Pension Plan in
accordance with section 75 and 75A of the Pensions Act 1995, as amended. The
Seller shall ensure that the Pension Plan Actuary liaises with the Buyer's
Actuary to respond to any queries raised by the Buyer's Actuary before the
Pension Plan Actuary certifies the debt due under section 75 and 75A of the
Pensions Act, as amended. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller and Buyer
shall ensure that the foregoing process coincides with the Final Post-Closing
Adjustment; provided, that, in no event shall the Final Post-Closing
Adjustment be completed until the Actuarial Statement is deemed final by the
Pension Plan Actuary.

(b) The Actuarial Statement, as finally approved by the Pension Plan Actuary
following its liaisons with the Buyer's Actuary, shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Seller and Buyer and shall conclusively determine the
amount of Closing Indebtedness in relation to the annuity buy-out cost of the
Automated Packaging Systems Pension Plan. In the event of any disagreement
between the parties, either party may refer the matter to an independent
actuary appointed by the President of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries
who shall determine the dispute between the parties. Each party shall bear its
own costs, but the cost of the independent actuary shall be paid in equal
proportions by the Seller and Buyer.

2.4.5 Final Adjustment Statement and Final Post-Closing Adjustment. The
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment
will become the



6 "Final Adjustment Statement" and the "Final Post-Closing Adjustment,"
respectively, and will become final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer, the
Seller, Sellers' Representative and their respective Affiliates for all
purposes of this Agreement, upon the earliest to occur of the following:

(a) the mutual acceptance by Buyer and Sellers' Representative of the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment,
respectively, with the changes or adjustments, if any, as may be proposed by
Sellers' Representative and consented to by Buyer in writing;

(b) the expiration of thirty (30) days after Sellers' Representative's receipt
of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing
Adjustment, respectively, without timely written objection by Sellers'
Representative in accordance with Section 2.4.2; or

(c) the determination by the Independent Accountants of the Final Adjustment
Statement, the Final-Post-Closing Adjustment and the components thereof in
accordance with Section 2.4.3.

2.4.6 Adjustment of Purchase Price.

(a) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.4, is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then (i) Buyer will
pay the amount of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment to Sellers' Representative
for the benefit of the Seller by means of a wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Sellers' Account and (ii) Buyer and Sellers'
Representative will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the
Sellers' Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.4, is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer and
Sellers' Representative will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse the amount of the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment to Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow Amount in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; provided, that (i) if the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, Buyer and
Sellers' Representative will direct the Escrow Agent to disburse the balance
of the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Sellers' Account and (ii) if the Final
Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the amount by
which the Final Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount
will be paid by Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Seller Parties) to
Buyer by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer; provided, that, except in the case of Fraud, the ESOP
Trust's liability for its pro rata portion of such amount shall be limited to
and only payable from the Sellers' Representative Holdback Amount.

(c) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.4, is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer and Sellers'
Representative will



7 deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to disburse the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Sellers' Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(d) All payments due and payable pursuant to this Section 2.4.6 will be made
no later than two (2) Business Days after the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment become the Final Adjustment
Statement and the Final Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, pursuant to
Section 2.4.5. For Tax purposes, any payment by Buyer or the Seller Parties
under this Agreement will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
unless a contrary treatment is required by Law.

2.4.7 Payment to the Seller. Upon payment by (or at the direction of) Buyer to
the Seller of any amounts required to be delivered to the Seller in accordance
with this Agreement: (a) such payments shall constitute full payment of such
then-due amounts, in complete satisfaction of Buyer's payment obligations to
the Seller with respect thereto; (b) Buyer shall have no obligation or
responsibility of any kind or nature to ensure that the Seller invests or
properly accounts for the funds received from Buyer or to ensure that the
funds are distributed to the Stockholders, or to oversee or otherwise be
responsible for distribution or disbursement of such funds; and (c) Buyer
shall be released, without further action by any of the parties, from all
further payment obligations with respect to such payments.

2.5 Consent to Transactions. Each Seller Party and the Company hereby
irrevocably consent to the transfers of the equity interests of the Company
contemplated herein and in respect of the Pre-Closing Transactions (and any
document entered into in connection with this Agreement or the Pre-Closing
Transactions) and irrevocably waive any rights such Person may have arising
from or relating to such transfers (including any rights of first refusal, co-
sale or similar rights and any rights to receive notices, opinions or similar
documentation in advance of or in connection with such transfers or
contributions), whether arising under or pursuant to (a) any Organizational
Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) any buy-sell agreement
between the Company and such Person, including any such agreement set forth on
Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Letter, (c) applicable Law, or (d) any right it
may otherwise have; provided, that this waiver shall not affect any rights any
such party hereto may have against the other parties under this Agreement and
shall not be effective if the Closing does not occur and this Agreement is
terminated in accordance herewith; provided further, that the consents and
waivers granted under this Section 2.5 by the ESOP Trustee are conditioned on
the receipt by the ESOP Trustee of the Fairness Opinion and the Shareholder
Approval Requirement under Section 6.1(f)(xiv) being satisfied.

2.6 Required Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer, the Acquired Companies, Sellers' Representative and the
Seller are entitled to deduct and withhold, as the case may be, from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement any
amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld from the consideration
under the Code, or any provision of any Tax Law. Buyer and the Acquired
Companies will provide Sellers' Representative with reasonable notice of any
proposed deduction and withholding prior to making the deduction or
withholding and consult in good



8 faith with Sellers' Representative to reduce or eliminate the amount of the
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are withheld, the
withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid in accordance with this Agreement to the Person in respect of which
the deduction and withholding was made, and the withheld amounts will be
delivered by Buyer, the Acquired Companies, Sellers' Representative or the
Seller, as the case may be, to the applicable Taxing Authority.

Representations and Warranties Concerning the Transaction

Except for the information in the Disclosure Letter, each Seller Party
represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date hereof and as of the Closing

follows (with the agreement that no Seller Party makes any representation or

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation, and is qualified or registered to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or operations would
require such qualification or registration, except where the failure to be so
qualified or registered would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the ability of such Seller Party to carry out its obligations under, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the Seller
Ancillary Agreements. If such Seller Party is a natural person, such Seller
Party is of sound mind, has the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement
and the Seller Ancillary Agreements to which he or she is a party, has entered

to be a trust that is part of an "employee stock ownership plan" within the
meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code and Section 407(d)(6) of ERISA, and
is intended to remain so until converted into a profit sharing plan as
provided in Section 8.6.4. The ESOP Trustee has the power and authority to
execute and deliver, on behalf of the ESOP Trust, this Agreement and the
Seller Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and under the ESOP Trust, subject to the fulfillment
of the requirements of Section 8.6.4. The ESOP Trustee has been duly appointed
by the Company to serve as the trustee of the ESOP Trust.

(c) Each Seller Party possesses all requisite legal right, power, authority
and capacity (individually, as trustee, or otherwise) to execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement, and each other agreement, instrument and document to
be executed and delivered by such Seller Party pursuant hereto and in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively,



9 the "Seller Ancillary Agreements"), and to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein and therein. The execution, delivery and performance by
such Seller Party of this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Agreements and
the consummation by such Seller Party of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby have been duly and validly authorized (by corporate action or
otherwise) on the part of such Seller Party.

3.2 Ownership of Shares. Except as set forth in the Organizational Documents
(in the case of each Seller Party which is a trust), (a) each Stockholder is
the sole beneficial and record owner of, and has good and marketable title to,
all of the Stockholder's Respective Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other
than restrictions on transfer generally included under applicable federal and
state securities Laws) and (b) the Seller (i) at the Closing will be the sole

sell, assign and transfer the LLC Interests in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (subject, with respect to the ESOP, to the satisfaction of any
applicable shareholder voting requirements under applicable Law and the
Organizational Documents). Other than this Agreement, and the Organizational
Documents, there are no outstanding contracts, commitments, understandings,
arrangements or restrictions (other than restrictions on transfers generally
included under applicable federal and state securities Laws), to which such
Seller Party is a party or by which such Seller Party is bound pursuant to
which any other Person has any option, warrant or other right to acquire any
of the Stockholder's Respective Shares or the LLC Interests, as applicable.

3.3 Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.

(a) This Agreement has been, and each Seller Ancillary Agreement upon delivery
will be, duly executed and delivered by such Seller Party and constitutes, or
upon the delivery will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Seller Party, enforceable in accordance with its respective terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws of general application affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights or by principles of equity (the
"Enforceability Exceptions").

(b) Subject to the fulfillment of the requirements of Section 8.6.4, the
execution and delivery by the ESOP Trustee of this Agreement and the Seller
Ancillary Agreements to which the ESOP Trust is a party and the consummation
by the ESOP Trust of the transactions consummated hereby and thereby (i) does

"prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA), (iii) to the ESOP Trustee's knowledge, is in the best
and sole interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the ESOP, and (iv)
does not and will not violate or conflict with any provision of the ESOP.

Filing), and with respect to the ESOP, the applicable requirements of Section
8.6.4, neither



10 the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Seller Ancillary Agreement
nor the consummation by such Seller Party of the transactions contemplated

of the Organizational Documents of the Seller; (ii) violate or result in a
violation of, or constitute a default under (whether after the giving of

conflict with, breach or result in a breach or default (whether after the
giving of notice, lapse of time or both) under, give rise to a right of
termination, modification or acceleration of any provision of, or require the
offering or making of any payment or redemption under, require any notice or
approval under, or otherwise adversely affect any rights of such Seller Party
under, any Contract to which such Seller Party is a party or by which any of
such Seller Party's assets or properties are bound; except in each case to the
extent that any such occurrence would not materially delay or impair the
ability of such Seller Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Filing), no consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made

Agreement; or (ii) the compliance by such Seller Party with any of the
provisions hereof or thereof or the consummation by such Seller Party of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

The Company represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date hereof and as of
the Closing Date (except to the extent that any representation or warranty
speaks as of a specific date, in which case it is made only as of such
specific date) as follows:

4.1 Organization and Good Standing; Authority; Enforceability.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Ohio. After the consummation of the
Pre-Closing Transactions, the Company will be a limited liability company,
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Ohio. Section 4.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company, including the

requisite power and authority to own and lease its assets and to operate its
business as the same are now being owned, leased and operated. Each of the
Acquired Companies is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
entity in, and is in good standing in, each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or its ownership of its properties requires it to be so
qualified or licensed, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise
materially impair or delay the Company's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Company Ancillary
Agreements. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered or Made
Available to Buyer a true, correct and complete copy of the Organizational
Documents, as currently in effect, for each of the Acquired Companies, and no
amendments thereto are pending (except to the extent contemplated by this
Agreement). The Organizational Documents of each of the Acquired Companies, as
delivered or Made Available to Buyer, are in full force and effect, and no
Acquired Company is, and to the Company's Knowledge, no other party is, in
violation of any provision thereof.

(b) The Company possesses all requisite legal right, power, authority and
capacity (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement, and each other agreement, instrument and document to be executed
and delivered by the Company pursuant hereto and in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Company Ancillary
Agreements"), and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and
therein.

the Company Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company.

(c) This Agreement has been, and each Company Ancillary Agreement upon

Transactions: (A) there are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or
understandings with respect to the voting of any equity of the Company; (B)

shares or securities of the Company, or any other similar right, security,
instrument or agreement) and there is no commitment or agreement to grant or

sole member) of the Company are entitled to vote.

(b) Ownership Interests of the Subsidiaries. The authorized, issued and
outstanding ownership interests of each Subsidiary are as set forth in Section
4.2(b) of the Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the
Disclosure Letter, there are no voting trusts, proxies, or other agreements or
understandings with respect to the voting of any ownership interests of any
Subsidiary. There does not exist nor is there outstanding any right or
security granted to, issued to, or entered into with, any Person to cause any
Subsidiary to issue, grant or sell any ownership interests of that Subsidiary
to any Person (including any warrant, option, call, preemptive right,
convertible or exchangeable obligation, subscription for ownership interests
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for ownership interests of that
Subsidiary, or any other similar right, security, instrument or agreement),
and there is no commitment or agreement to grant or issue any such right or
security. There is no obligation, contingent or otherwise, of any Subsidiary

or other equity interests of that Subsidiary; or (ii) provide funds to, or
make any investment in (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise), or provide any guarantee with respect to the obligations of, any
other Person (other than the other Acquired Companies). There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness which have the right to vote (or which
are convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which equity owners of any Subsidiary are entitled to
vote. The outstanding ownership interests of each Subsidiary are owned by the
applicable Acquired Company or other Person, as applicable, as set forth in
Section 4.2(b) of the Disclosure Letter, free and clear of any Liens (with
respect to the ownership interests owned by an Acquired Company).

Letter and (ii) for the applicable requirements of the HSR Act (including the
HSR Filing), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of

14 or result in a breach of any provisions of the Organizational Documents of any
Acquired Company; (B) violate or result in a violation of, or constitute a

the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Acquired Companies as
of and for the three (3) month period ended March 31, 2019 (the "Unaudited

Financial Statements, for (1) normal year-end adjustments (none of which,
individually or in the aggregate, are material) and (2) the absence of
disclosures normally made in footnotes (that, if presented, would not differ
materially from the types of disclosures included in the Audited Financial

and valid obligations arising from sales actually made or services actually
performed by the Acquired Companies in the ordinary course of business. The
reserves for accounts receivable set forth in the Acquisition Balance Sheet
were calculated in accordance with GAAP applicable as of the date of the
Acquisition Balance Sheet, and were determined on a basis consistent with the
Accounting Policies, including the Acquired Companies' historical methods and
past practices in establishing such reserves. Subject to such reserves, each
account receivable has been or will be collected in full without any set-off
in the ordinary course of business. There is no contest, claim or right to
set-off, other than returns and claims in the ordinary course of business,
under any agreement with any obligor of any such account receivable relating
to the amount or validity of such account receivable.

usable for the purpose for which it was procured or manufactured and salable
at customary gross-margins in the ordinary course of business, except for
obsolete items, excess items or items of below-standard quality, for which
adequate reserves have been provided, and reflected in the Acquisition Balance
Sheet and the books and records of the Acquired Companies, in accordance with
GAAP, consistently applied. All of the Inventory is owned by the Acquired
Companies free and clear of any Liens (excluding Permitted Liens). Except as
set forth in Section 4.5(d) of the Disclosure Letter, no Inventory is held on

requirements of the Acquired Companies in any material respect. The Inventory
(other than goods in transit to customers or from suppliers) is located at the
Real Property.

set forth in Section 2.3(c), no Acquired Company will have, or be liable for,
any outstanding Closing Indebtedness (other than the Closing Indebtedness set

Transaction Bonuses. Section 4.5(e)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth an
estimated amount of the Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies as of the date
hereof. Section 4.5(e)(iii) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth an estimated
amount of Selling Expenses, calculated as if the Closing occurred on the date
hereof. Section 4.5(e)(iv) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth an estimated
amount of the Transaction Bonuses, calculated as if the Closing occurred on
the date hereof.

otherwise) on the part of Buyer.

5.2 Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. This Agreement has been, and each
Buyer Ancillary Agreement upon delivery will be, duly executed and delivered

others. Buyer has sufficient experience in business, financial and investment
matters to be able to evaluate the purchase of the LLC Interests and to make
an informed investment decision with respect to that purchase. Buyer is an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 promulgated under the
1933 Act. Buyer has had the opportunity as it has deemed adequate to obtain
from the Acquired Companies any information as is necessary to permit Buyer to
evaluate the merits and risks of investment in the Acquired Companies. Buyer
understands and acknowledges that: (a) none of the LLC Interests have been
registered or qualified under the 1933 Act, or under any securities Laws of
any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, in reliance upon
specific exemptions thereunder for transactions not involving any public
offering; (b) all of the LLC Interests constitute "restricted securities" as
defined in Rule 144 under the 1933 Act; (c) none of the LLC Interests are
traded or tradable on any securities exchange or over-the-counter; and (d)

Interests and qualification in accordance with any applicable state securities
Laws becomes effective or unless registration and qualification is
inapplicable, or an exemption therefrom is available.

5.5 Sufficiency of Funds. Buyer has and will continue to have readily
available funds sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each Buyer Ancillary Agreement, and Buyer understands that its
obligations hereunder are not in



41 any way contingent or otherwise subject to the consummation of any financing
arrangements or obtaining any financing.

5.6 Solvency. Assuming that (a) the representations and warranties of the
Acquired Companies and the Seller Parties contained in this Agreement are
complete and correct in all material respects, (b) that the Acquired Companies
and the Seller Parties are in compliance in all material respects with their
respective covenants set forth in this Agreement and (c) satisfaction of the
conditions to Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or waiver of such conditions, immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer and each of
the Acquired Companies: (i) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of
its assets will not be less than the sum of its liabilities and that the
present saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount required
to pay its probable liabilities as they become absolute and matured) and (ii)
will have adequate capital with which to engage in its business. In completing
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer does not intend to
hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditors of Buyer or the
Acquired Companies.

5.7 Brokerage. Except as set forth in Section 5.7 of the Buyer Disclosure
Letter, no Person is or will become entitled, by reason of any Contract,
arrangement or understanding entered into or made by or on behalf of Buyer, to
receive any commission, brokerage, finder's fee or other similar compensation
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

5.8 Due Diligence Investigation. Buyer has had an opportunity to discuss the
business, management, operations and finances of the Acquired Companies with
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and
Affiliates, and has had an opportunity to inspect the facilities of the
Acquired Companies. Buyer has conducted its own independent investigation of
the Acquired Companies. Buyer acknowledges that no current or former
shareholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of any of the
Acquired Companies has made or is making any representations, warranties or
commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied, except as set forth in Articles 3 and 4. The parties acknowledge
and agree that nothing in this Section 5.8 will apply to, prevent, limit or
otherwise affect in any way whatsoever Buyer's right to make any claim in

ARTICLE 7 
The Closing

Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 8.1.4, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (the "Closing") will take
place on the date that is no later than the first (1st) Business Day of the
calendar month that starts immediately following the second (2nd) Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) of all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof) and will take place by email
exchange of relevant signature pages, deliveries and other documents as
described herein (with originals, as applicable, to follow via regular or
overnight mail), unless Buyer and Sellers' Representative otherwise mutually
agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is the "Closing Date."
The transfers and deliveries described in Article 6 are mutually
interdependent and regarded as occurring simultaneously, and, any other
provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, no one transfer or delivery
becomes effective or is deemed to have occurred until all of the other
transfers and deliveries provided for in Article 6 also have occurred or been
waived in writing by the party entitled to the transfer or delivery, it being
understood that Sellers' Representative has the authority to waive, on behalf
of the Seller Parties or any Seller Party, any delivery required at or before
the Closing by Buyer. Notwithstanding the actual occurrence of the Closing at
any particular time on the Closing Date, the Closing shall be deemed effective
as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time");
provided, however, that Transaction Bonuses, Selling Expenses, and Closing
Indebtedness (and other similar amounts) actually paid on the Closing Date or
economically borne by the Seller and paid by Buyer or an Acquired Company (at
the direction of the Seller) on the Closing Date, and any Tax deductions
related thereto, shall be allocated to the Seller for income tax purposes to
the extent permitted by



47 applicable Law. For purposes of passage of title and risk of loss, the
effective time is the actual time of the Closing, as described in this Article
7.

ARTICLE 8

Additional Covenants and Agreements

8.1 Pre-Closing Covenants and Agreements.

8.1.1 Conduct of Business. During the period between the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1.4 or the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Period"),
except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Letter, or except to the extent Buyer otherwise consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company
will and will cause each of the other Acquired Companies to (a) act and carry
on its business in the ordinary course of business, (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve in all material respects each
Acquired Company's business organization, assets, properties, goodwill and
relationships with its customers, suppliers, vendors, employees and other
third parties in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and (c) maintain all of its current insurance policies (or promptly replace
the same). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
expressly provided herein or as set forth in Section 8.1.1 of the Disclosure
Letter, without the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not, and shall cause the
other Acquired Companies not to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action
(or omit to take any action) which, if taken (or omitted to be taken) after
the date hereof, would have been required to be listed in Section 4.6 of the
Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to
subsection (i) of Section 4.6; provided further, that this restriction shall
still apply if the applicable entry into, amendment, modification or
termination described in subsection (i) of Section 4.6 was not in the ordinary
course of business or would otherwise limit or restrict in any material
respect the freedom of any Acquired Company to engage in any business or
compete with any Person; (ii) hire or terminate any employees of any Acquired
Company with a salary in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or
(iii) modify or terminate any Contract with an employee or Contractor made in
favor of any Acquired Company that contains restrictive covenants, including
non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, in a manner that would
decrease the scope or coverage of such covenants. For the avoidance of doubt,
prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies may use cash on hand to pay
existing Indebtedness without any consent of Buyer; provided, that such
payments do not (A) violate the terms of any Contract to which an Acquired
Company is party or (B) otherwise create any liability for any Acquired
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing and, prior to the
Closing, the Company shall exercise, consistent with and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and the other Acquired Companies' operations.

8.1.2 Access. During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer and its representatives
will have reasonable access during normal business hours to the personnel,
facilities, premises,



48 properties, counsel, accountants, consultants, representatives, books and
records (including Tax records), contracts, financial and operating data and
other information and documents (in compliance with applicable Privacy Laws
and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement) of, or pertaining to, the
Acquired Companies as Buyer may reasonably request. The Acquired Companies
shall reasonably cooperate with any such reasonable requests for access to the
extent such access does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
businesses of the Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
representatives of Buyer will not be permitted to conduct any environmental
testing or sampling at the Acquired Companies' facilities. Any inspection
pursuant to this Section 8.1.2 will be conducted in a manner that does not
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the businesses of the Acquired
Companies, and in no event will any provision hereof be interpreted to require
the Acquired Companies to permit any inspection or to disclose any information
that the Acquired Companies reasonably determine may violate any Law, any of
their legal obligations with respect to confidentiality or that would result
in the loss of an attorney-client or work product privilege. During the Pre-
Closing Period, Buyer and its representatives will not contact any of the
employees, landlords, customers or suppliers of the Acquired Companies without
the prior written consent of Sellers' Representative (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The parties acknowledge and
agree that any and all of those contacts will be arranged by Sellers'
Representative and that Buyer and Sellers' Representative will mutually agree
on the timing and manner of contact with all employees, landlords, customers
or suppliers.

8.1.3 Satisfaction of Closing Conditions; HSR.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Company and Buyer will each use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary under the terms of this Agreement or under
applicable Laws to cause the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or
make all authorizations, filings, consents, Permits, waivers or other
approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for
its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant
to, this Agreement, and the parties will reasonably cooperate with each other
with respect to each of the foregoing, including by using commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect the Representation and
Warranty Policy.

(b) Buyer and the Company agree to file, or cause to be filed, a Notification
and Report Form and documentary materials in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the United States Federal Trade Commission
and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice as soon
as practicable, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date
hereof (the "HSR Filing"), which HSR Filing requests early termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. All filing fees payable with
respect to this filing will be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by the Seller. Buyer
and the Company agree to promptly file any other report required by any other
Governmental Authority relating to antitrust matters, and to promptly make any
filings or submissions required under any applicable foreign antitrust or
trade regulation Law (which filings or submissions, to the extent applicable,



49 request early termination of any applicable waiting period), and any filing
fees payable in connection therewith will be paid by 50% by Buyer and 50% by
the Seller. Each of the Company and Buyer will furnish to the other necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under any
other applicable antitrust regulation. Each of the Company and Buyer will
promptly inform the other party of any material communication it has or
receives from any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of the HSR Filing or any foreign
antitrust or competition filing. Each of the Company and Buyer will: (a) use
its respective commercially reasonable efforts to comply as expeditiously as
possible with all requests of any Governmental Authority for additional
information and documents, including information or documents requested under
the HSR Act or other applicable antitrust regulation; (b) not (i) extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or any applicable antitrust regulation or
(ii) enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each
case, with the prior consent of the other party; (c) cooperate with the other
and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any action,
including legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (d) to the extent permitted
by Law, provide counsel for the other party with copies of all filings made by
such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with
any Governmental Authority or received from such a Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.1.4 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers' Representative;

(b) by Buyer or Sellers' Representative, upon written notice to the other
party, if a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction has issued,
promulgated, enacted, entered or enforced a final non-appealable Order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; except that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1.4(b) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of such Order;

Seller Parties or the Company have become untrue, in the case of (A) or (B)
such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(c) would not be satisfied
and, in either case, such breach or inaccuracy is not waived or, if curable,
cured, in each case, prior to the earlier of (I) thirty (30) days after notice
thereof and (II) the Termination Date; or (ii) Sellers' Representative if none
of the Seller Parties, the Company or Sellers' Representative are then in
material breach of their respective obligations under this Agreement and (A)
there is a breach of



50 any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Buyer set
forth in this Agreement or (B) any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer have become untrue, in the case of (A) or (B) such that the conditions
set forth in Section 6.2(c) would not be satisfied and, in either case, such
breach or inaccuracy is not waived or, if curable, cured, in each case, prior
to the earlier of (I) thirty (30) days after notice thereof and (II) the
Termination Date; or

(d) by (i) Buyer if any of the conditions in Section 6.1 have not been
satisfied on or before the date that is the six (6) month anniversary of the
date of this Agreement (the "Termination Date") or if satisfaction of any such
condition is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Buyer to
comply with or perform its obligations under this Agreement) and Buyer has not
waived such condition; or (ii) Sellers' Representative if any of the
conditions in Section 6.2 have not been satisfied on or before the Termination
Date or if satisfaction of any such condition is or becomes impossible (other
than through the failure of the Seller, the Company or Sellers' Representative
to comply with or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement)

each case, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

Agreement (other than this Section 8.1.4, Section 8.2.2, Section 8.2.4 and
Article 11, as well as any defined terms used in such sections, which will
survive any such termination) will become null and void and have no further
force and effect and all other rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder
will terminate without any liability on the part of any party to any other
party, except for liabilities arising in respect of Fraud or breaches of this
Agreement by any party prior to such termination.

8.1.5 Pre-Closing Publicity. During the Pre-Closing Period, except as
otherwise set forth herein, no party will make any public announcement or
press release regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein
without the prior approval of Buyer or Sellers' Representative, as the case
may be, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, except (a) as required by applicable Law or by any Governmental
Authority or the rules of any stock exchange or trading system or (b) as may
be reasonably necessary to enforce any right or remedy under or relating to
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall make the initial
press release made after the execution hereof, subject to Sellers'
Representative's approval as set forth above. In addition, nothing herein
precludes communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions
of this Agreement, and Buyer, the Seller Parties, Sellers' Representative and
their respective Affiliates may make any disclosures they consider necessary
to satisfy their legal or contractual obligations to their lenders,
shareholders or investors without the prior written consent of the Seller
Parties or Sellers' Representative or Buyer, as the case may be.

8.1.6 Representation and Warranty Policy. The parties acknowledge that, as of
the date hereof, Buyer has obtained (at its sole cost, including the total
premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commission, Taxes related to such
policy and other fees and expenses of such policy) the Representation and
Warranty Policy. Buyer will not modify or cancel the



51 Representation and Warranty Policy without Sellers' Representative's written
consent if such modification or cancelation would permit the insurer under the
Representation and Warranty Policy to have any express right of
indemnification, contribution, subrogation or other rights to pursue any claim
against any Seller Party or Sellers' Representative (other than in respect of
Fraud).

8.1.7 Repair List. Buyer and the Company agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement as to the contents of the Repair List (as such term
is defined under the Lease Term Sheet), and further acknowledge and agree that
such Repair List is intended only to include (i) those repairs of material
importance necessary for the applicable Leased Real Property to continue for
the next three (3) years to be functional in a similar manner as currently
used and (ii) any repairs required for such Leased Real Property to comply
with applicable Laws.

8.1.8 Updated Employee Listing. The Acquired Companies will provide an updated
Employee Listing, including a breakdown of compensation by category for
calendar year 2018 for employees in Asia and Latin America, approximately two
(2) weeks before the anticipated Closing Date, but in no event less than three
Business Days prior to the Closing.

8.2 Miscellaneous Covenants.

8.2.1 Post-Closing Publicity. Following the Closing, no party will make any
public disclosure or comment regarding the specific terms of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated herein without the prior approval of Buyer or
Sellers' Representative, as the case may be, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except as may be required by
Law or by any Governmental Authority or the rules of any stock exchange or
trading system or as may be reasonably necessary to enforce any right or
remedy under or relating to this Agreement, except that (a) each party is
entitled to disclose or comment to any Person that a transaction has been
consummated and provide any information previously made public as part of a
press release or public announcement issued or made in accordance with Section

apply to any earnings call conducted by Buyer.

8.2.2 Expenses. Buyer will pay all fees and expenses incident to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are incurred by Buyer or its
representatives or are otherwise expressly allocated to Buyer hereunder, and
the Seller Parties or the Acquired Companies (with the Acquired Companies only
being obligated for payment of any expenses of the Seller Parties and the
Acquired Companies if the payment is made prior to the Closing or the expenses
are accrued on the Final Adjustment Statement) will pay all fees and expenses
incident to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are incurred
by the Seller Parties or any Acquired Company or their respective
representatives or are otherwise expressly allocated to the Seller Parties
hereunder; provided, that the ESOP Trust's liability for such expenses shall
be limited to and only payable from the Sellers' Representative Holdback
Amount.



52 8.2.3 Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the execution of this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge that the confidentiality letter agreement
relating to confidential information of the Company executed by Sealed Air
Corporation and the Company, dated September 28, 2018 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), remains in full force and effect pursuant to its terms, except to
the extent reasonably necessary for Buyer to enforce any of its rights under
this Agreement, but will terminate automatically, without action by any party
thereto, at the Closing.

8.2.4 Access by Sellers' Representative. Buyer will, and will cause each of
the Acquired Companies to, for a period of five (5) years after the Closing
Date, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, provide
Sellers' Representative and Sellers' Representative's designees and
representatives with reasonable access to the books and records of the
Acquired Companies that is reasonably requested by Sellers' Representative in
connection with the preparation of the Seller Parties' financial reports or
Tax Returns (including the Tax Returns described in Section 9.2.1), the
defense or prosecution of Proceedings (other than Proceedings in which Buyer
is the opposing party) and any other reasonable need of Sellers'
Representative (including Tax matters in which a Seller Party is involved) to
consult such books and records, who will be entitled, at Sellers'
Representative's expense, to make extracts and copies of these books and
records. Sellers' Representative will treat confidentially any information
obtained pursuant to this Section 8.2.4, in accordance with Section 8.7,
including any information related to Buyer, any Acquired Company or the
businesses of the Acquired Companies. Buyer will not, during the five (5) year
period, destroy or cause or permit to be destroyed any material books or
records without first obtaining the consent of Sellers' Representative (or
providing to Sellers' Representative notice of its intent to destroy and a
reasonable opportunity to copy the applicable books or records, at the Seller
Parties' expense, at least thirty (30) days prior to destruction).

8.2.5 Continuation of Indemnification. Following the Closing, Buyer will cause
the Acquired Companies to, in accordance with their respective Organizational
Documents, indemnify and hold harmless each of the present and former
directors and officers of the Acquired Companies, in their capacities as such,
from and against all damages, costs and expenses actually incurred or suffered
in connection with any threatened or pending Proceeding at Law or in equity by
any Person or any arbitration or administrative or other Proceeding relating
to the businesses of the Acquired Companies or the status of such individual
as a director or officer prior to the Closing, to the fullest extent
contemplated under the respective Organizational Documents of the Acquired
Companies as of the date hereof. Buyer will not amend or modify the
Organizational Documents of any of the Acquired Companies with respect to any
indemnification provision or provisions, including provisions respecting the
advancement of expenses, in effect on the Closing Date for the benefit of the
(current or former) directors or officers (except to the extent that such
amendment preserves or broadens the indemnification or other rights
theretofore available to such directors or officers). At the Closing, Buyer
will purchase a "tail" policy with respect to the existing directors' and
officers' and fiduciary liability insurance policies of the Acquired Companies
covering all current members of the board of directors and officers of the
Acquired Companies for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date.
Buyer will not knowingly take or fail to take, and will take commercially



53 reasonable steps to cause the Acquired Companies not to take or fail to take,
any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the termination,
cancellation, rescission or other adverse consequence with respect to the
coverage provided by the tail policy(ies). Buyer will use, or cause the
Acquired Companies to use, reasonable commercial efforts to submit claims (or
assist the officers and directors covered under the policy in submitting
claims) and to take all other actions reasonably necessary to provide to the
Acquired Companies and the directors and officers thereof the full benefits to
which they are entitled under the tail policy(ies). This Section 8.2.5 will
continue for a period of six (6) years following the Closing and is intended
to benefit each director and officer of the Acquired Companies who has held
such capacity on or prior to the Closing Date and is now or at any time during
that six (6) year period entitled to indemnification or advancement of
expenses pursuant to any provisions contained in such Acquired Companies'
Organizational Documents as of the date hereof. In the event Buyer, any of the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective successors and assigns (a)
consolidates with or merges into any Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in the consolidation or merger or (b)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in either case, the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Acquired
Companies, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this Section 8.2.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no director or officer
of any Acquired Company will have any right of indemnification or right of
advancement from Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) with respect to breaches of this Agreement by such Person (in his
or her capacity as a Stockholder) or the Company.

8.2.6 Sellers' Representative.

(a) Sellers' Representative is designated by each Seller Party to serve as the
representative of the Seller Parties with respect to the matters expressly set
forth in Section 8.2.6(b) and with respect to the matters otherwise set forth
in this Agreement to be performed by Sellers' Representative. Should the
initial Sellers' Representative resign or be unable to serve, the Stockholders
currently holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares as of the date
hereof on a fully diluted basis will designate a single substitute agent to
serve as the successor Sellers' Representative. The appointment of a successor
will be effective on the date of Sellers' Representative's resignation or
incapacity or, if later, the date on which the successor is appointed.

(b) Each Seller Party, by the execution of this Agreement, irrevocably
appoints Sellers' Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for
that Seller Party for all purposes of this Agreement, including the full power
and authority on that Seller Party's behalf: (i) to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein and any post-Closing matters, including
making decisions and taking any action with respect to the matters set forth
in Section 2.4 (Post-Closing Adjustment); (ii) to pay that Seller Party's
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance of this
Agreement (whether incurred on or after the date of this Agreement); (iii) to
disburse any funds received hereunder to that Seller Party and each other
Seller Party and to hold and disburse funds from the Sellers' Representative
Holdback Amount for the payment of post-Closing fees, expenses and other
obligations of the Seller Parties or Sellers' Representative in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (with



54 any excess from the Sellers' Representative Holdback Amount after payment of
such post-Closing fees, expenses and other obligations to be disbursed to the
Seller); (iv) to endorse and deliver any certificates or instruments
representing the LLC Interests and execute any further instruments of
assignment as Buyer will reasonably request; (v) to make, execute and deliver
on behalf of that Seller Party any amendment or waiver of, or in connection
with, this Agreement and the other agreements or documents contemplated hereby
as Sellers' Representative, in Sellers' Representative's sole discretion, may
deem necessary or desirable; (vi) to take all other actions to be taken by or
on behalf of that Seller Party in connection herewith; (vii) to do each and
every act and exercise any and all rights that the Seller Parties collectively
are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement; (viii) to
prepare and distribute to each Seller Party any documentation necessary or
desirable for the filing of income Tax Returns; and (ix) to make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements, guarantees,
orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates,
letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to
take any and all action that Sellers' Representative, in Sellers'
Representative's sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all other agreements and documents referred
to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and therewith,
including holding and disbursing the Sellers' Representative Holdback Amount
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, retaining counsel, accountants
and other agents, representatives and experts, incurring fees and expenses,
asserting or pursuing any claim against Buyer, the Company or any Seller
Party, defending any claims by Buyer or third parties, consenting to,
compromising or settling any of those claims, conducting negotiations with
Buyer, the Company and their respective representatives regarding those
claims, it being understood that Sellers' Representative does not have any
obligation to take any such actions, and will not have any liability for any
failure to take any such actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, however, Sellers' Representative does not have the power to take any
action or actions arising out of any alleged breach of any representation or
warranty in Article 3 or any covenant or agreement contained herein by a
particular Seller Party or group of the Seller Parties without the express
authorization of that Seller Party or group of the Seller Parties, and Buyer
acknowledges this limitation. Each Seller Party acknowledges that this agency
and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the
consent of Sellers' Representative and survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller Party. All decisions and
actions by Sellers' Representative (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) are binding upon all of the Seller Parties, and no Seller Party has
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest any decision or
action; except that Sellers' Representative will not take any action where (x)
any single Seller Party would be held solely liable for any actual losses
(without that Seller Party's consent) or (y) the action materially and
adversely affects the substantive rights or obligations of one Seller Party,
or group of Seller Parties, without a similar proportionate effect upon the
substantive rights or obligations of all Seller Parties, unless each
disproportionately affected Seller Party consents to the action.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers' Representative shall consult with the
ESOP Trustee in advance of any decision regarding a resolution of differences
that may adversely affect the consideration paid for the LLC Interests.



55 (c) Buyer and the Acquired Companies may rely on any action taken or omission
to act by Sellers' Representative, on behalf of a Seller Party, pursuant to
Section 8.2.6(b) above (an "Authorized Action"), and each Authorized Action is
binding on each Seller Party as fully as if that Seller Party had taken the
Authorized Action. Sellers' Representative, in its capacity as Sellers'
Representative, has no liability to Buyer or the Company for any Authorized
Action, except to the extent that the Authorized Action is found by a final
order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or
willful misconduct. Each Seller Party severally, for itself only and not
jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless Sellers'
Representative against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by Sellers' Representative in connection with any Proceeding to which
Sellers' Representative is made a party by reason of the fact he is or was
acting as Sellers' Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
any expenses incurred by Sellers' Representative in connection with the
performance of Sellers' Representative's duties hereunder; provided, that the
ESOP Trust's liability for such expenses shall be limited to and only payable
from the Sellers' Representative Holdback Amount.

(d) Sellers' Representative is not entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of Sellers' Representative's services, but is
entitled to the payment by the Seller Parties of all expenses incurred as
Sellers' Representative; provided, that the ESOP Trust's liability for its pro
rata portion of such expenses shall be limited to and only payable from the
Sellers' Representative Holdback Amount.

(e) Sellers' Representative does not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller Party, except in respect of
amounts received hereunder on behalf of a Seller Party. Sellers'
Representative is not liable to any Seller Party for any action taken or
omitted by Sellers' Representative or any agent employed by Sellers'
Representative hereunder or under any other document entered into in
connection herewith, except that Sellers' Representative is not relieved of
any liability imposed by Law for fraud or willful misconduct. Sellers'
Representative is not liable to the Seller Parties for any apportionment or
distribution of payments made by Sellers' Representative in good faith, and if
any apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made
in error, the sole recourse of any Seller Party to whom payment was due, but
not made, is to recover from the other Seller Parties any payment in excess of
the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. Neither
Sellers' Representative nor any agent employed by Sellers' Representative will
incur any liability to any Seller Party by virtue of the failure or refusal of
Sellers' Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of Sellers'
Representative's other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud or bad faith. Buyer and each Acquired Company is hereby
relieved from liability from any Seller Party for any acts done by any of them
in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers'
Representative.

(f) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to Sellers'
Representative under this Agreement survive the Closing Date.



56 8.2.7 Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing, at the request
of any party hereto, each other party hereto will execute and deliver further
certificates, instruments and other documents and take, or cause to be taken,
other action as the party may reasonably request to carry out the transactions
contemplated hereby or as may be necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law.

8.3 No Shop. During the Pre-Closing Period, none of the Seller Parties,
Sellers' Representative, the Acquired Companies nor any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, managers, officers, employees, representatives or
agents (including William Blair and Company, L.L.C.) will, directly or
indirectly, (a) discuss, encourage, negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize,
recommend, propose or enter into, whether as the proposed surviving, merged,
acquiring or acquired corporation or otherwise, any transaction involving an
investment in, merger, consolidation, recapitalization (or similar
transaction), business combination, purchase or disposition of any material
amount of the assets of any Acquired Company or any capital stock or other
ownership interest in any Acquired Company, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (an "Acquisition Transaction"), (b) facilitate,
encourage, support, solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations or
submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction,
(c) furnish or cause to be furnished to any Person, any information concerning
the business, operations, properties or assets of any Acquired Company in
connection with an Acquisition Transaction or (d) otherwise cooperate in any
way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or
attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, by way of providing access to any electronic data room
or entering into a letter of intent or memorandum of understanding). Each
Seller Party, the Company and each of their respective Affiliates will (i)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted prior to or on the date
of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Transaction and (ii) request
any non-public information concerning the Acquired Companies that was
delivered in connection with any Acquisition Transaction (other than with
Buyer) to be immediately returned to the Company or destroyed, subject to the
terms of any confidentiality agreement related thereto. The Acquired
Companies, the Seller Parties and Sellers' Representative shall promptly
advise Buyer of, and provide to Buyer a summary of the material terms of, any
proposal in respect of an Acquisition Transaction that has been submitted to
an Acquired Company, its Affiliates or any of its or their respective
representatives (including any advisors).

8.4 Seller Release. Effective upon the Closing, each Seller Party, on behalf
of himself, herself or itself, and each of their respective successors and
assigns (each, a "Seller Releasor"), releases, acquits and forever discharges,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the Acquired Companies and
each of their respective current officers, directors, managers, shareholders,
partners, equity holders, members, Affiliates and employees of, from and
against any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages,
judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description
whatsoever, that Seller Releasor ever had, now has or may have by reason of or
relating to Seller Releasor being an equity holder of any Acquired Company;
except that this release does not extend to any claim to enforce Seller
Releasor's



57 rights under this Agreement, any Seller Ancillary Agreement or any Company
Ancillary Agreement.

8.5 Acquired Company Engagements; Privileged Information.

8.5.1 Acquired Company Engagements. Calfee, Halter and Griswold LLP ("Calfee")
has acted as counsel for the Acquired Companies, the Seller Parties and
Sellers' Representative (collectively, the "Calfee Clients") in connection
with this Agreement (the "Sale Engagement"), and Calfee has not acted as
counsel for any other Person, including Buyer, in connection therewith;
provided, that Ballard Spahr LLP has acted as counsel for the ESOP Trustee.
Upon the Closing, only the Calfee Clients will be considered clients of Calfee
in the Sale Engagement. All communications between the Calfee Clients and
Calfee in the course of or related to the Sale Engagement are deemed to be
attorney client confidences that belong solely to Sellers' Representative and
not the Acquired Companies. Accordingly, none of the Acquired Companies or
Buyer may have access to any of these communications, or to the files of
Calfee relating to these communications unless otherwise approved in writing
by Sellers' Representative or required by applicable Law; except that nothing
in this Section 8.5.1 limits or precludes Buyer or any Acquired Company from
using or relying upon any documents or information that are in the possession
or control of any Acquired Company on or after the Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) the
Seller Parties, Sellers' Representative and Calfee are the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to communications that relate
exclusively to the Sale Engagement, and neither the Acquired Companies nor
Buyer is a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Calfee in respect
of the Sale Engagement constitute property of a Calfee Client, only the Seller
Parties and Sellers' Representative hold property rights (except as set forth
in the preceding sentence) and (c) Calfee has no duty to reveal or disclose
any attorney-client communications or files related to the Sale Engagement to
the Acquired Companies or Buyer by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Calfee and the Acquired Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 8.5.1, in the event that a dispute
arises following the Closing between Buyer and any of its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any third party who is not a party to this Agreement, on the
other hand, (x) Buyer or any of its Affiliates may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of communications or information by Calfee to
a third party and Sellers' Representative will afford Buyer and its Affiliates
and their accountants, counsel and other representatives access to all
information and documents covered by the privilege to the extent reasonably
necessary for Buyer or any of its Affiliates to evaluate or defend any claims
by a third party and (y) Sellers' Representative shall not waive such retained
privilege without the prior written consent of Buyer. Any attorney-client
privilege that does not attach as a result of the representation by Calfee of
the Acquired Companies solely in connection with the Sale Engagement belongs
to the Acquired Companies and may be controlled by the Acquired Companies and
may be waived only by the Acquired Companies, and not the Seller Parties or
Sellers' Representative, and does not pass to and may not be claimed or used
by Sellers' Representative.

8.5.2 Post-Closing Legal Representation of the Seller Parties and Sellers'
Representative. Without the need for any consent or waiver by the Acquired
Companies or



58 Buyer, Calfee will be permitted to represent any Seller Party and Sellers'
Representative after the Closing in connection with any matter, including the
Sale Engagement.

8.6 Employee and Employee Benefit Matters.

8.6.1 Credit. As applicable and to the extent that Buyer does not maintain the
employee benefit plans of the Acquired Companies, on and after the Closing
Date, Buyer will give each employee of the Acquired Companies (the
"Transferred Employees") full credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates made available to the Transferred
Employees and for all purposes under any severance plan, paid-time-off or
vacation pay plan maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates and made available to
the Transferred Employees, for the Transferred Employees' service to any of
the Acquired Companies to the same extent the service is recognized by the
comparable employee benefit plan or arrangements maintained by the Transferred
Employee's employer immediately prior to the Closing.

8.6.2 Administration. Following the date of this Agreement, the parties hereto
will cooperate in all matters reasonably necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 8.6.

8.6.3 Treatment of Plans. The Company and each Acquired Company shall (a)
effective no later than one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, terminate
any and all U.S. Plans providing benefits or coverage in the nature of health,
life or disability insurance following retirement or other termination of
employment (other than death benefits when termination occurs upon death and
other than any health plan continuation rights under Section 4980B of the Code
and corresponding provisions of ERISA), and shall pay or arrange for payment
to any participant in such a Plan any amount determined for such participant
under the amendment terminating such Plan (which amount with respect to any
participant who is either a current retiree or an active employee who has met,
or is within three (3) years of meeting, the age and service requirements for
such benefit shall be intended to reflect an actuarial present value of the
participant's benefit based on such assumptions as Seller may reasonably
determine), and (b) contingent upon the occurrence of Closing and effective as
of the Closing Date, terminate the Automated Packaging Systems, Inc.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the Executive Deferred Bonus Plan
and provide for payment of the benefits thereunder immediately prior to or at
the Closing (collectively, the Plans in (a) and (b), the "Terminating Plans").
To the extent the amounts payable to the participants under the amendments
terminating the Terminating Plans have not been paid prior to Closing, then
Seller and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the steps to close out
the Terminating Plans including the applicable Acquired Company making
remaining payments due under the termination amendments and Seller advancing
or promptly reimbursing the applicable Acquired Company the cost of making
such distributions (including the employer share of any FICA or employment
taxes or other similar amounts), to the extent the same is not otherwise
included in Closing Indebtedness. In addition, effective no later than one day
before the Closing Date, the Seller, the Company, and each Acquired Company
shall transfer sponsorship of the restricted share arrangements with
executives of the Company (the "Restricted Share Arrangements") and all
obligations thereunder to Seller and Seller shall, at or



59 after Closing, terminate and arrange for payment of any amounts due under the
Restricted Share Arrangements. Further, the Seller, the Company, and each
Acquired Company shall, effective no later than one day before the Closing
Date and contingent upon Closing, amend the Automated Packaging Systems
Deferred Incentive Compensation Scheme (the "DICS") to provide for its
termination and for distribution of benefits to each participant thereunder in
not more than five annual installments payable by Automated Packaging Systems
Limited or other Acquired Company employing such participant and providing
that no further amendments to the DICS may be made that would adversely affect
the rights of any participant in the DICS existing at Closing. The Seller
shall procure that the Company and, if applicable, each Acquired Company
shall, no later than one day before the Closing Date and contingent upon
Closing, give notice to the trustee of the Automated Packaging Systems Pension
Plan of ceasing liability to contribute pursuant to Clause V of the
Supplemental Deed dated 21st December 1993 thereby triggering a wind-up of
such Plan pursuant to Sections 75 and 75A of the Pensions Act 1995, as
amended. At the request of Buyer, each Acquired Company (as applicable) will
provide Buyer with evidence (i) that amendments terminating each such Plan to
be terminated pursuant to this Section 8.6.3 (or in the case of the Restricted
Share Arrangements, amendments transferring the sponsorship and obligations to
Seller), effective as indicated herein, have been duly adopted no later than
the day prior to the Closing Date pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the
applicable governing body or committee of the Acquired Company and (ii) the
trustee of the Automated Packaging Systems Pension Plan has received the
notice described in the previous sentence. To the extent Buyer and the
Acquired Companies are involved in the sponsorship, administration and windup
of any of the Plans terminated pursuant to this Section 8.6.3, they shall act
in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the terms of such Plan,
including the termination amendment thereof (except as such Plan may be later
amended), and applicable Law. With respect to any other Plan which as of
immediately after the Closing is sponsored by an Acquired Company, Buyer and
the Acquired Companies shall administer such Plans in accordance with their
terms and applicable Law; provided, that Buyer may amend or terminate any such
Plan in such a manner as is consistent with the terms of such Plan and
applicable Law.

8.6.4 ESOP Matters.

(a) Not later than the Closing, the Company and Seller shall adopt, subject to
the review and consent of the ESOP Trustee and Buyer (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), an amendment to the ESOP
(the "ESOP Amendment") to provide that, subject to the consummation of the
Closing, effective at, immediately following or after the Closing as may be
applicable, (i) Seller shall become the plan sponsor and have all the power
and authority of the "Company" as defined in and for purposes of the ESOP with
respect to periods thereafter (and without assuming any responsibility with
respect to prior periods), (ii) the ESOP shall be a profit sharing plan
(within the meaning of Section 401 of the Code), and shall cease to be a stock
bonus plan and an employee stock ownership plan (within the meaning of
Sections 401 and 4975 of the Code), (iii) the ESOP shall be terminated; (iv)
pursuant to the termination of the ESOP, no further contributions will be made
to the ESOP as of the Closing except for contributions that have been accrued
on behalf of participants and beneficiaries prior to the Closing Date, or that
are otherwise required by the IRS in connection with the issuance of a
favorable determination letter with respect to the termination of the ESOP,
(v) pursuant to the



60 termination of the ESOP, all ESOP participants whose account balances had not
previously been distributed in full will be fully vested, (vi) no new
participants will be admitted to the ESOP after the Closing, and (vii) such
other changes as Seller deems appropriate, which may include, by way of
example, provisions regarding the exercise of voting power with respect to the
equity of Seller after the Closing and constraints on amendments to the ESOP
or the replacement of the administrator or administrative committees of the
ESOP after the Closing. The ESOP Amendment shall further provide for full
distribution of plan benefits in one or more payments as Seller, in
consultation with the ESOP Trustee, may determine, with such distributions
being completed as provided in Section 8.6.4(c).

(b) Following the Closing, Seller shall administer and operate the ESOP in all
material respects in accordance with the qualification and tax-exemption
requirements of the Code and the requirements of ERISA. Pursuant to the
termination of the ESOP by the ESOP Amendment, within 120 days after the
Closing, the Seller shall file an application with the IRS for a determination
for terminating plan (Form 5310) requesting a favorable determination letter
to the effect that the termination of the ESOP shall not affect the qualified
and tax-exempt status of the ESOP under the Code. The application by the
Seller to the IRS shall disclose that the Seller intends to maintain the
ESOP's trust fund until the later of receipt of the favorable determination
letter or the distribution of all funds held in escrow. Following the Closing,
Seller shall promptly adopt, subject to the prior notification of the ESOP
Trustee and Sellers' Representative, such amendments to the ESOP as are
required by the IRS as a condition to the issuance of such favorable
determination letter (provided such actions and amendments would not require
material contributions by Seller or materially increase the exposure or
obligations of Seller with respect to the ESOP), shall otherwise respond
promptly to any request by the IRS to provide additional information and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts, including the payment of necessary
fees and expenses, to obtain such favorable determination letter from the IRS,
as promptly as practicable.

(c) All payments to ESOP participants shall be made in accordance with the
terms of the ESOP (including the ESOP Amendment), taking into account any
timely and properly completed distribution elections made in accordance with
the terms of the ESOP. With respect to any participant, beneficiary of a
deceased participant or alternate payee who has filed an affirmative election
to receive distribution from the ESOP, provided that properly completed
distribution elections in accordance with the terms of the ESOP have been made
and received by Seller, the portion of the account balances of such
participant, beneficiary or alternate payee in the ESOP shall be distributed
in accordance with the terms of the ESOP. The final distribution of remaining
account balances (after any interim distributions), after full payment of the
ESOP administrative expenses incurred by the ESOP Trustee as described in
Section 8.6.4(d), of such participant, beneficiary or alternate payee in the
ESOP, shall be distributed in cash as soon as reasonably practicable following
the later of (i) the receipt of a favorable determination from the IRS to the
effect that the termination of the ESOP did not adversely affect its tax-
qualified status; or (ii) the final distribution of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount and the Sellers' Representative Holdback Amount and the receipt by the
ESOP of its share of such amounts and any other amounts due to it in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the redemption of its
shares and the windup of Seller. Following the Closing, with Seller's
cooperation, Buyer shall,



61 and shall cause the Company to, take such actions as are necessary and
appropriate to permit a participant receiving an eligible rollover
distribution (as defined in Section 402(t) of the Code) from the ESOP (as so
amended), who is then employed by Buyer or the Company, to transfer directly,
in a rollover under Sections 401(a)(31) and 402(c) of the Code, all or any
portion of such distribution to a qualified plan maintained by Buyer or the
Company, if permitted by such plan and if such rollover will not have an
adverse effect on such qualified plan.

(d) On or before the Closing Date, Seller and the Company shall take all
actions (including adopting resolutions or amendments) necessary or
appropriate to permit all reasonable fees and expenses of the ESOP Trustee and
reasonable administration expenses of the ESOP and costs associated with

the extent permitted by ERISA, until such time as all assets of the ESOP have
been distributed to participants, beneficiaries and alternate payees.

(e) The ESOP Trustee shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain (to the extent
possible) an opinion (the "Fairness Opinion"), stating that, as of the Closing
Date (i) the consideration to be received by the ESOP for the Shares pursuant
to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not less
than "adequate consideration" within the meaning of Section 3(18) of ERISA,
and (ii) the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taken as a whole, are fair to the ESOP from a financial point of
view.

8.6.5 No Amendment of Employee Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 8.6 to the contrary, nothing contained herein, whether express or
implied, should be treated as an amendment to or other modification of any
employee benefit plan maintained by Seller, the Company, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates. If (a) any participant or beneficiary makes a claim or
takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment
to any employee benefit plan maintained by Seller, Buyer or any of their
Affiliates and (b) the provision is deemed to be an amendment to the employee
benefit plan maintained by Seller, Buyer or any of their Affiliates even
though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then, solely with
respect to the employee benefit plan maintained by Seller, Buyer or any of
their Affiliates at issue, the provision will lapse retroactively and have no
amendatory effect.

8.6.6 Maintenance of Certain Plans in 2019. Following the Closing, with
respect to calendar year 2019, Buyer agrees to cause the Acquired Companies to
maintain the existing Management Incentive Plan Bonus and Variable Pay
Incentive Plan and make payments thereunder in accordance with the terms of
such plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

8.6.7 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. All provisions contained in this Section
8.6 are included for the sole benefit of Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Acquired Companies, on the other hand, and nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, creates any third-party beneficiary or other rights (a) in
any other Person, including any employee or former employee of any of the
Acquired Companies, any participant in any employee benefit plan maintained by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any dependent or beneficiary of any
participant or (b) to continued employment with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.



62 8.7 Confidentiality. For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing
Date, each Seller Party shall keep secret and maintain in confidence, and
shall not use for his, her or its benefit or for the benefit of others, any
trade secrets, ideas, know-how, inventions, methods, formulae, models,
methodologies, processes and processing instructions, technical data,
specifications, research and development information, technology, including

persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use of
confidential or proprietary information relating to the business of the
Acquired Companies or their financial or other affairs, including all
Intellectual Property and other premises, properties, personnel, books,
records (including Tax records), Contracts and documents of or pertaining to
the Acquired Companies, other than any of such information that is in the
public domain through no unauthorized action or inaction by such Seller Party
(or its representatives) in breach of this Section 8.7. The foregoing shall
not prohibit use of such information (a) to the extent that furnishing or use
of such information is required by any Order, Law, regulatory process or
Proceeding, (b) as is necessary to prepare Tax Returns (including Tax Returns
of any Seller Party or of any of its Affiliates) or other filings with any
Governmental Authority or to defend or object to any reassessment of Taxes,
(c) as is necessary for such Seller Party (or its representatives) to prepare
and disclose, as may be required, accounting statements, (d) that is received
by such Seller Party (or its representatives) from a third party; provided,
that such information was not known by such Seller Party to be the subject of
any contractual obligation of confidentiality to, or for the benefit of, any
Acquired Company, (e) that was or is independently developed by such Seller
Party (or its representatives) without any use of or reference to the
information that is the subject of this Section 8.7 or (f) as may be required
to bring, prosecute, respond to or otherwise handle any Proceeding relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing herein will restrict any Person from making any disclosure
permitted by Section 8.2.1.

ARTICLE 9

Tax Matters

9.1 Apportionment of Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, "Seller Tax
Obligations" shall include: (a) all Taxes of any Acquired Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period; and (b) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on any
Acquired Company and/or Buyer (to the extent pertaining to the Acquired
Companies) as a transferee or successor, by contract, pursuant to any law, or
otherwise, but only to the extent such Taxes relate to or arise out of a Pre-
Closing Tax Period; provided, that any non-U.S. income Tax deductions
attributable to payments made pursuant to the Surviving Plans and that are
paid after the Closing Date shall be excluded from the computation of Seller
Tax Obligations. Any and all Taxes and Tax liabilities with respect to the
Acquired Companies that relate to a Straddle Period will be apportioned
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows:
(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or measured by
reference to income, receipts, profits, capital or net worth (including sales
and use Taxes), (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible, other than
as provided for in Section 9.6) or (C) required to be withheld, Taxes
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period



63 will be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the Tax year
ended at the end of the day on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the Acquired Companies other than
those described in subsection (i) of this Section 9.1, Taxes allocated to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of Taxes for the entire
period (or, in the case of Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of
Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period; provided, however, that any non-U.S. income Tax deductions
attributable to payments made pursuant to the Surviving Plans that are paid
after the Closing Date shall, to the extent they relate to a Straddle Period,
be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period that begins immediately
after the Closing Date.

9.2 Tax Returns.

9.2.1 Tax Returns. Sellers' Representative will, at its sole cost and expense,
prepare or cause the Acquired Companies to prepare all income Tax Returns of
the Acquired Companies that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Straddle Period (collectively, "Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns") and will
cause the Acquired Companies to provide to Buyer drafts of the Pre-Closing
Income Tax Returns for review and comment at least forty-five (45) days prior
to the due date for the filing of each Pre-Closing Income Tax Return,
including extensions. Not later than twenty (20) days after Sellers'
Representative has provided a Pre-Closing Income Tax Return, Buyer will notify
Sellers' Representative of the existence of any objection, specifying in
reasonable detail the nature and basis of the objection that Buyer may have to
any item set forth on the draft Pre-Closing Income Tax Return. Buyer (on
behalf of itself and the Acquired Companies) and Sellers' Representative agree
to consult and resolve in good faith any objection. If the objection cannot be
resolved within five (5) days after delivery of such notice, the parties will
submit the dispute for resolution to the Independent Accountants pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 2.4.3. If the Independent Accountants
cannot resolve such dispute no later than five (5) days prior to the due date
for filing the relevant Pre-Closing Income Tax Return, Buyer will cause the
Acquired Companies to file the Pre-Closing Income Tax Return in the manner
proposed by Sellers' Representative; except that if the dispute is ultimately
resolved by the Independent Accountants in favor of Buyer, Buyer may cause the
relevant Acquired Company to file an amendment to the Pre-Closing Income Tax
Return consistent with the Independent Accountants' determination. Except as
otherwise required by Law or to avoid the imposition of penalties, all Pre-
Closing Income Tax Returns will be prepared consistent with past practices.

9.2.2 Other Tax Returns. Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company will, at
Buyer's sole cost and expense, prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, any Tax Returns not required to be filed, or caused to be filed, by
Sellers' Representative pursuant to Section 9.2.1 that relate to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. Buyer will provide to Sellers'
Representative drafts of any such Tax Returns that include any Seller Tax
Obligations for which the Seller may be liable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement for Sellers' Representative's review and comment at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the due date for the filing of each such Tax Return,
including extensions, or such shorter period as is commercially



64 reasonable. Not later than twenty (20) days after Buyer has provided a draft
Tax Return, Sellers' Representative will notify Buyer of the existence of any
objection, specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the
objection that Sellers' Representative may have to any item set forth on the
draft Tax Return. Buyer (on behalf of itself and the Acquired Companies) and
Sellers' Representative agree to consult and resolve in good faith any
objection. If the objection cannot be resolved within five (5) days after
delivery of such notice, the parties will submit the dispute for resolution to
the Independent Accountants pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
2.4.3. If the Independent Accountants cannot resolve such dispute no later
than five (5) days prior to the due date for filing the relevant Tax Return,
Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies to file the Tax Return in the manner
proposed by Buyer; except that if the dispute is ultimately resolved by the
Independent Accountants in favor of Sellers' Representative, Buyer will cause
the relevant Acquired Company to file an amendment to the Tax Return
consistent with the Independent Accountants' determination. Except as
otherwise required by Law or to avoid the imposition of penalties, all such
Tax Returns will be prepared consistent with past practices.

9.2.3 Tax Treatment. Buyer and its Affiliates, each Acquired Company and the
Seller agree to treat, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the purchase of
the LLC Interests as (a) with respect to the Seller, the Seller shall be
deemed to sell, in a taxable sale, the Company's assets in exchange for the
amounts paid in respect of the LLC Interests pursuant to this Agreement, and
(b) with respect to Buyer, Buyer shall be deemed to acquire, by taxable
purchase, all such assets of the Company in exchange for the amounts paid in
respect of the LLC Interests pursuant to this Agreement. Except as otherwise
required by Law, specifically set forth in this Agreement, or to avoid the
imposition of penalties, without prior written consent of Sellers'
Representative (which consent shall not be unduly withheld, conditioned or
delayed), none of Buyer, any Acquired Company or any Affiliate thereof will
(i) make any election with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) change
the Tax treatment of any item on a Tax Return filed after the Closing Date as
compared to the treatment of that item on a Tax Return filed by the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing, or (iii) file any amended Tax Return or
propose or agree to any adjustment of any item with the Internal Revenue
Service or any other Taxing Authority with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, if in any such case that action would have the effect of increasing
the Seller's responsibility for any Taxes or reducing any Tax benefit of the
Seller.

9.2.4 Tax Elections. The Seller and Buyer agree with respect to filing of Tax
Returns (in each case to the extent applicable): (a) to treat any income Tax
deductions permitted under applicable Law resulting from the payment of any
Selling Expenses and any Transaction Bonuses, and the payment of Repaid
Closing Indebtedness (including any deductions for financing fees), as
occurring on the Closing Date; and (b) to make (and cause the Acquired
Companies to make) the election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to apply the
seventy percent (70%) safe-harbor to any "success based fee" as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.263(a)-5(f), including the investment banking
fees paid to William Blair and Company, L.L.C.

9.3 Controversies. If any Taxing Authority issues to any Acquired Company or
any of its Affiliates any written notice of any inquiries, assessments,
proceedings or similar



65 events with respect to any Seller Tax Obligations for which the Seller may be
liable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (any such inquiry, assessment,
proceeding, litigation, audit or similar event, a "Tax Matter"), Buyer will
notify Sellers' Representative within ten (10) days of receipt of such notice.
Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control any such Tax Matter, at its
own expense; provided, however, that Sellers' Representative may, at Sellers'
Representative's own expense, participate in and, upon written notice to
Buyer, assume the defense of any Tax Matter to the extent such Tax Matter
relates solely to a Tax period ending on or prior to Closing Date. Sellers'
Representative will not enter into any settlement of, or otherwise compromise,
any Tax Matter for which Sellers' Representative assumes the defense to the
extent that such settlement or compromise is reasonably expected to adversely
affect the Tax liability of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any Affiliate of
the foregoing for a Post-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent
of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. Sellers' Representative will keep Buyer informed with respect to the
commencement, status, and nature of any Tax Matter that Sellers'
Representative is controlling, and will, in good faith, allow Buyer to consult
with Sellers' Representative regarding the conduct of or positions taken in
any such Tax Matter. If Sellers' Representative does not (or cannot, under the
terms of this Agreement) assume the defense of a Tax Matter, Buyer will keep
Sellers' Representative informed of the progress of that Tax Matter from time
to time and will consult with Sellers' Representative with respect to that Tax
Matter. Neither Buyer nor any of the Acquired Companies will have the right to
settle (or to consent to the settlement or compromise of) that Tax Matter
without the prior written consent of Sellers' Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, if the settlement
or compromise would cause the Seller to be responsible for any part of the
settlement amount to be paid with respect to that Tax Matter.

9.4 Cooperation. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit
examinations and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the
Tax liabilities imposed on the Acquired Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, the parties will cooperate fully with each other, including the
furnishing or making available during normal business hours of records,
information, personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of
attorney or other materials reasonably relevant or helpful for the preparation
of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of
claims by Taxing Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. Buyer agrees to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Acquired Companies relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations and any extension thereof for the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer and Sellers' Representative
will, upon request, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

9.5 Allocation of Purchase Price. The consideration paid for the LLC Interests
hereunder and the liabilities (to the extent included in amount realized for
federal income Tax purposes) of the Company will be allocated among the assets
of the Company in accordance with their fair market values determined using
the methodology set forth in Section



66 9.5 of the Disclosure Letter (the "Allocation Schedule") (which schedule will
be adjusted to reflect changes in the Purchase Price in accordance with
Section 2.4.5) and Section 1060 of the Code, as applicable). Buyer, the Seller
and each of their respective Affiliates will file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Schedule, and none of the parties will
voluntarily take any position inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule in any
inquiry, assessment, action, proceeding, audit or similar event relating to
Taxes.

9.6 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest), and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other such charges, in each case
incurred in connection with this Agreement will be paid (a) one half by
Sellers' Representative (on behalf of all Seller Parties) and (b) one half by
Buyer when due, and Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if
required by applicable Law, Sellers' Representative will cause the Seller and
all other Affiliates of the Seller to join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

9.7 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax allocation, sharing, reimbursement or
similar agreements with respect to or involving any Acquired Company shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Acquired Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder.

Notices so addressed will be deemed to have been duly given (i) on the first
(1st) Business Day after the day of registration, if sent by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, (ii) on the next Business Day following the
documented acceptance thereof for next-day delivery by a national overnight

84 11.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Disclosure Letter and
Exhibits hereto, and the Seller Ancillary Agreements, the Company Ancillary
Agreements and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements, constitute the exclusive
statement of the agreement among the Company, Buyer, each Seller Party and
Sellers' Representative concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersede
all other prior agreements, oral or written, among or between any of the
parties hereto concerning that subject matter. All prior and contemporaneous
negotiations among or between any of the parties hereto are superseded by this
Agreement, and there are no representations, warranties, promises,
understandings or agreements, oral or written, in relation to the subject
matter hereof among or between any of the parties hereto other than those
expressly set forth or expressly incorporated herein or in the Seller
Ancillary Agreements, the Company Ancillary Agreements or the Buyer Ancillary
Agreements, as applicable.

11.4 Modification. No amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement or
any provision hereof, including the provisions of this sentence, will be
effective or enforceable unless made in a written instrument that specifically
references this Agreement and that is signed by (i) in the case of an
amendment or modification, Buyer, the Company and Sellers' Representative, or
(ii) in the case of a waiver, the party waiving compliance.

11.5 Jurisdiction and Venue. Each party hereto agrees that any claim relating
to this Agreement will be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, or to the extent such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and the
appellate courts thereof. All objections to personal jurisdiction and venue in
any action, suit or proceeding so commenced are hereby expressly waived by all
parties hereto. The parties waive personal service of any and all process on
each of them and consent that all such service of process will be made in the
manner, to the party and at the address set forth in Section 11.2 of this
Agreement, and service so made will be complete as stated in Section 11.2. The
Seller Parties expressly acknowledge the notice and service of process to
Sellers' Representative for each of them in accordance with Section 11.2 and
this Section 11.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any disputes between the
parties that are submitted to the Independent Accountants for resolution
pursuant to the terms of Section 2.4.3 will be resolved as set forth in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.4.3. Each party hereto hereby
acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this
Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore
each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right that party
may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (a)
no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) such party understands
and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party makes this
waiver voluntarily and (d) such party has been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 11.5.

11.6 Enforcement.



85 11.6.1 The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that
the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or
otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with that remedy. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that
a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

11.6.2 Without limiting the foregoing, if the Closing does not occur because
of a breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement, and all of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 to Buyer's obligations have either been
satisfied or previously waived (or would have been satisfied or are capable of
being satisfied but for the breach of Buyer's obligations under this
Agreement), then either Sellers' Representative or the Company will have the
right to a court order specifically enforcing the provisions of this Agreement
and to which the breach applies and, in any event, to specifically force the
Closing to occur. If Sellers' Representative or the Company brings any action
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement by Buyer, the Termination Date will automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which that action is pending, plus twenty (20)
Business Days or (ii) any other time period established by the court presiding
over that action.

11.6.3 Without limiting the foregoing, if the Closing does not occur because
of a breach by any Seller Party or the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement, and all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 to the Seller
Parties' obligations have either been satisfied or previously waived (or would
have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied but for the breach of
such Seller Party's or the Company's obligations under this Agreement), then
Buyer will have the right to a court order specifically enforcing the
provisions of this Agreement and to which the breach applies and, in any
event, to specifically force the Closing to occur. If Buyer brings any action
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement by the Seller Parties or the Company, the Termination Date will
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which that action
is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (ii) any other time period
established by the court presiding over that action.

11.7 Binding Effect. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the
benefit of Buyer, the Company, Sellers' Representative, each Seller Party and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

11.8 Headings. The article and section headings used in this Agreement are
intended solely for convenience of reference, do not themselves form a part of
this Agreement, and may not be given effect in the interpretation or
construction of this Agreement.

11.9 Number and Gender; Inclusion; Interpretation. Whenever the context
requires in this Agreement, the masculine gender includes the feminine or
neuter, the neuter gender includes



86 the masculine or feminine, the singular number includes the plural, and the
plural number includes the singular. In every place where it is used in this
Agreement, the word "including", "include" or "includes" is intended and will
be construed to mean "including, without limitation." When a reference is made
in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference will be to
an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used in
this Agreement may have a disjunctive and not alternative meaning (i.e., where
two items or qualities are separated by the word "or", the existence of one
item or quality shall not be deemed to be exclusive of the existence of the
other and, as the context may require, the word "or" may be deemed to include
the word "and"). Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to
herein, or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein, means
such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by
waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. Unless expressly provided otherwise, the measure of a
period of one month or year for purposes of this Agreement shall be that date
of the following month or year corresponding to the starting date; provided,
that if no corresponding date exists, the measure shall be that date of the
following month or year corresponding to the next day following the starting
date. For example, one month following February 18 is March 18, and one month
following March 31 is May 1. All references to "dollars" or "$" herein are
references to U.S. Dollars. If any time period for giving notice or taking
action hereunder expires on a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable
time period shall automatically be extended to the Business Day immediately
following such day.

11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement and each document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement may be executed by the parties in separate counterparts and by
facsimile or by electronic mail with scan or attachment signature, each of
which when so executed and delivered will be deemed an original, and all
counterparts will together constitute one and the same instrument. Each
counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof or thereof each signed by
less than all, but together signed by all of the parties. A facsimile,
electronic or other copy of a signature will be deemed an original for
purposes of this Agreement.

11.11 Third Parties. Except as may otherwise be expressly stated herein, no
provision of this Agreement is intended or will be construed to confer on any
Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, any rights hereunder.

11.12 Disclosure Letter and Exhibits. The Disclosure Letter and Exhibits, if
any, referenced in this Agreement constitute an integral part of this
Agreement as if fully rewritten herein. Any information disclosed in one
section of the Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed in other
sections of the Disclosure Letter and applicable to other representations and
warranties to the extent that the disclosure is reasonably apparent from a
reading of the disclosure item to be applicable to any other section or
subsection of the Disclosure Letter and any other representations and
warranties. The Disclosure Letter may include items and information that are
not "material" relative to the entire business of the Acquired Companies,



87 taken as a whole, and that inclusion will not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material" or to further define the meaning of that term for purposes of this
Agreement or otherwise.

11.13 Construction. This Agreement and the other documents contemplated herein
will be deemed to have been drafted by the parties, and neither this Agreement
nor any other document contemplated herein will be construed against any party
as the principal draftsperson hereof or thereof. For purposes of Articles 3
and 4 (including, for the purposes of Articles 3 and 4 only, any definitions
used in Articles 3 and 4), (a) reference to any legislation, legal term or
concept in respect of any state or federal jurisdiction shall, in respect of
any other applicable jurisdiction, be construed as reference to the
legislation, legal term or concept which most closely corresponds to it in
that other jurisdiction and (b) any amount expressed in US dollars shall, to
the extent required to be expressed in any other currency in order to give
full effect to the applicable provision of this Agreement, be deemed for that
purpose to have been converted into the relevant currency immediately before
the close of business on the date of this Agreement (or, if that is not a
Business Day, the Business Day immediately such date).

11.14 Governing Law. This Agreement and the performance of the transaction and
obligations of the parties hereunder will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
choice-of-laws or conflict-of-laws provisions thereof.

11.15 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the Persons
that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to that party. Except to
the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by that named party in this Agreement and not
otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate or agent, attorney,
advisor or representative of any such Person or any of its Affiliates will
have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any
one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company or Buyer under
this Agreement of or for any claim (regardless of the legal theory under which
that claim is made, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or
in equity, or otherwise) based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 11.15, nothing in this Section 11.15 shall be
deemed to limit the right to bring a claim in respect of Fraud.

11.16 No Assignments. No assignment or transfer (including by way of operation
of law or a change in ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting
power of Buyer) of all or any part of this Agreement or any right or
obligation hereunder may be made by any party without the prior written
consent of all other parties, and any attempted assignment or transfer without
this consent is void and of no force or effect; except that (a) Buyer may
assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to
any controlled Affiliate of Buyer, but



88 no such assignment will relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder and (b)
Buyer may assign its rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement to
any of its financing sources.

Representative and have executed and delivered this Equity Purchase Agreement,
