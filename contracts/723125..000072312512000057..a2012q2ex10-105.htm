NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement as well
as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties to this Agreement hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I 
PURCHASE AND SALE; ASSUMED LIABILITIES; CLOSING

1.1 IMFS Business. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, IMFS will sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Micron
Singapore, and Micron Singapore will purchase and receive from IMFS, all of
IMFS's rights, title and interest in and to the whole of the IMFS Business as
a going concern, including all assets used in the IMFS Business and that are
listed in Schedule 1.1 to the IMFS BSA Disclosure Letter, except for any
Excluded Assets (collectively, the "MSA Purchased Assets"). 1.2 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, the MSA Purchased Assets shall not include (a) any of IMFS's
rights, title and interest in and to the Back-End Products existing as of the
Closing, which will be transferred to Intel Singapore at the Closing pursuant
to the IMFS Back-End Products Purchase Agreement, (b) the proceeds and rights
described in Section 1.6(a) and Section 1.6(c) and (c) any assets described in
Schedule 1.2 to the IMFS BSA Disclosure Letter (the "Excluded Assets").

1.3 Assumed Liabilities. Subject to Section 1.4, Micron Singapore will assume
from IMFS and shall, from and after the Closing Date, timely pay, discharge,
perform or otherwise satisfy all Liabilities and obligations of IMFS, whether
arising or accruing before or after the Closing Date and whether known or
unknown, absolute or contingent, asserted or unasserted, accrued or unaccrued,
liquidated or unliquidated, secured or unsecured, joint or several, due or to
become due, vested or unvested, executory, determined, determinable or
otherwise and whether or not the same is required to be accrued on the
financial statements of IMFS, including the Liabilities and obligations listed
in Schedule 1.3 to the IMFS BSA Disclosure Letter, but excluding the Retained
Liabilities (as defined below) (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities").

1.4 Retained Liabilities. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, Micron Singapore is not assuming, and IMFS shall pay, discharge,
perform or otherwise satisfy any product liability, warranty, refund and
similar Liabilities of IMFS or claims arising against IMFS with respect to any
products manufactured at the IMFS Fab Operations prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Retained Liabilities").

1.5 Title and Risk. Title and risk of loss or damage to the MSA Purchased
Assets shall pass to Micron Singapore upon the Closing.

1.6 Damage to IMFS Premises.

(a) Damage Prior to Closing. If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing, the IMFS Premises or any of the Plant and Machinery is/are
damaged in a manner that would require repairs outside the ordinary course,
but that damage does not amount to Material Damage, (i) IMFS shall at its own
cost and expense repair that damage prior to the Closing to the extent as
practical, (ii) Section 1.6(b) shall apply and (iii) any such repairs shall be
taken into account in determining the net book value of the affected assets
for purposes of determining the IMFS Net Book Value. Except as otherwise
agreed to in writing by Intel and Micron, to the extent that IMFS has received
or has any rights to receive any insurance proceeds or any recovery from any
third party in respect of such damage, IMFS shall retain such proceeds and
rights for application to such cost and expense of repair.

(b) Repair Works. IMFS must in carrying out the repair work to the damage
referred to in Section 1.6(a) ("Works"):

(i) comply with the reasonable directions of Micron Singapore;

(ii) carry out the Works in a proper and workmanlike manner to reinstate the
damaged premises as nearly as practicable to the state it was in before the
event of damage; and (iii) cause as little interruption to the operation of the rest of the
premises within the IMFS Premises as is reasonable in the circumstances.

(c) Material Damage. For the purpose of this Section 1.6, "Material Damage"
means damage to or destruction of the **** or any part thereof such that
either (i) will require the expenditure of more than **** to restore the ****
as nearly as practicable to the condition that the **** were in immediately
prior to the occurrence of such event, or (ii) reduce the **** of the **** by
at least **** immediately prior to the occurrence of such event, which **** is
reasonably expected to be incapable of being substantially restored within a
period of ****. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Intel and Micron,
to the extent that IMFS has received or has any rights to receive any
insurance proceeds or any recovery from any third party in respect of such
Material Damage, IMFS shall retain such proceeds and rights for application to
such cost and expense of repair.

(d) Right to Terminate. If there is Material Damage prior to the Closing, any
of the Parties shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice to the other Parties, and upon such termination the terms of Section
5.5(e) shall apply; provided, however, that in the case of any Material Damage
resulting from a reduction in ****, as contemplated by Section 1.6(c)(ii), no
Party shall be entitled to provide such notice, and no Party shall be entitled
to terminate this Agreement, if such Material Damage is reasonably expected to
be capable of repair by **** and such repair is effected prior to such date.
IMFS will use reasonable efforts to repair such damage as promptly as
practicable, and IMFS will provide Intel Singapore and Micron Singapore with
full access to the **** to observe and monitor any such repairs.

1.7 Purchase Price. IMFS shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Micron
Singapore three Business Days prior to the Closing a statement setting forth a
good faith estimate of the IMFS Net Book Value as of the Closing. In
consideration for the purchase of the IMFS Business contemplated by Section
1.1, Micron Singapore will, at the Closing:

(a) pay and deliver to IMFS cash (the "MSA Cash Purchase Price") in an
aggregate amount equal to the sum of (i) **** (which amount represents the
fair market value of the IMFS Premises as determined by the Appointed Valuer)
multiplied by the exchange rate of U.S. dollars per Singapore dollar reported
in the Wall Street Journal on the third Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date (the "IMFS Premises Value"), and (ii) if the Intel Singapore
Distribution (as defined in the 2012 Master Agreement) is greater than the
IMFS Premises Value, an amount equal to the positive difference between the
Intel Singapore Distribution (as defined in the 2012 Master Agreement) and the
IMFS Premises Value;

(b) issue and deliver a promissory note of Micron Singapore to IMFS, in
substantially the form attached as Exhibit A to the IMFS BSA Exhibit Letter
and having an initial principal balance equal to the estimated IMFS Net Book
Value as set forth in the statement delivered by IMFS, less the MSA Cash
Purchase Price (the "Estimated MSA Purchase Price Note"); and (c) assume the Assumed Liabilities.

1.8 Adjustment of Purchase Price.

(a) Post-Closing Statements. As soon as available, but in no event later than
90 days after the Closing Date, Micron Singapore shall prepare and deliver to
IMFS a written notice setting forth the IMFS Net Book Value and the Post-
Closing Adjustment, if any, together with reasonably detailed supporting
information (the "Post-Closing Statement").

(b) Objections. Unless IMFS notifies Micron Singapore in writing within 30
days following delivery of such Post-Closing Statement of any objection to the
computation of the IMFS Net Book Value or Post-Closing Adjustment, if any, set
forth therein (a "Notice of Objection"), the Post-Closing Statement shall
become final and binding. Following delivery of the Post-Closing Statement,
Micron Singapore shall permit IMFS and its representatives to review the
working papers of Micron Singapore relating to the Post-Closing Statement and,
at IMFS's written request, shall provide IMFS and its representatives access
to or copies of Micron Singapore's (and IMFS's) books and records relating to
the IMFS Business reasonably requested for purposes of IMFS's review of the
Post-Closing Statement and preparation of any Notice of Objection. Any Notice
of Objection shall specify the basis for the objections set forth therein in
reasonable detail. If IMFS provides a Notice of Objection within such 30-day
period, Micron Singapore and IMFS shall, during the 30-day period following
receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to resolve any
objections. During such 30-day period, Micron Singapore and its
representatives shall be permitted to review the working papers of IMFS and
its accountants relating to the Notice of Objection and the basis therefor.

(c) Resolution of Disputes. If Micron Singapore and IMFS are unable to resolve
all objections within such 30-day period, the matters remaining in dispute
shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. Each of Micron
Singapore and IMFS shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm their
written briefs detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of
each item remaining in dispute, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
authorized to resolve the matters remaining in dispute between Micron
Singapore and IMFS in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.8(c)
within the range of the difference between the positions with respect thereto
of Micron Singapore and IMFS. Micron Singapore and IMFS shall instruct, and
shall use their commercially reasonably efforts to cause, the Independent
Accounting Firm to render its reasoned written decision as to each disputed
item as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 60 days after the
dispute is submitted. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding, and the determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall constitute an arbitral award that is final,
binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court
having jurisdiction over such dispute. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Micron Singapore and IMFS in
inverse proportion as each such Party may prevail on the matters resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute, and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The fees and disbursements
of each Party and their representatives incurred in connection with their
preparation or review of the Post-Closing Statement, any Notice of Objection
and any dispute resolution, as applicable, shall be borne by such party. After
the final determination of the IMFS Net Book Value and the Post-Closing
Adjustment, if any, no Party shall have any further right to make any claims
against another in respect of any element of the IMFS Net Book Value or the
Post-Closing Adjustment.

(d) Post-Closing Payments. If the Post-Closing Adjustment as finally
determined under Section 1.8(b) or (c), as applicable, is a positive number,
the principal balance of the Estimated MSA Purchase Price Note shall be
increased by the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing
Adjustment, as so finally determined, is a negative number, the principal
balance of the Estimated MSA Purchase Price Note shall be decreased by the
amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any payment or any adjustment to the
Estimated MSA Purchase Price Note under this Section 1.8(d) shall be made
within two Business Days of the final determination of the Post-Closing
Adjustment.

1.9 Closing.

(a) Contemporaneous Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will occur contemporaneously with the Closing under the 2012
Master Agreement, and is conditioned on the satisfaction or proper waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article V, except as otherwise mutually agreed by
the Parties. "Closing Date" means the date on which the Closing occurs.

1.10 ****.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the 2012 Master Agreement, **** shall pay
any and all of the costs and expenses of all **** that are incurred by either
of the Parties in connection with the transfer or conveyance of the **** and
the assumption of the **** as contemplated by this Agreement, together with
any **** incurred in connection therewith. Each Party shall cooperate in a
good faith, commercially reasonable manner as reasonably requested by another
Party and at **** to minimize any **** and shall provide information
reasonably requested by the other Party, to allow the requesting Party to file
any **** related to **** or to meet any obligations imposed by any ****.

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the **** and the **** shall be sold
as a **** for the purposes of the **** and **** shall not be chargeable in
respect of the purchase consideration. To this end, **** agrees that after
Closing it shall use the **** in carrying on the same kind of business as the
****, whether or not as part of any existing business of ****. **** and ****
shall in consultation with each other jointly request a **** that **** is not
payable on the purchase consideration pursuant to the ****. **** and ****
shall cooperate with and provide all necessary information and assistance to
each other in respect of the request and application for the ****. In
connection with the foregoing, the Parties agree that in the event there are
any requests and/or enquiries from any Tax Authority, the same shall be dealt
with by **** and **** in consultation with each other and **** and ****
shall cooperate with and provide all necessary information and assistance
required by such Tax Authority upon being requested to do so by the other.
However, if applicable, **** shall promptly provide **** with a ****. ****
shall bear all **** payable in connection with the purchase of the ****.

1.11 Non-Assignable Assets. To the extent that any Contract, Permit or other
asset intended to be assigned pursuant to the terms of Section 1.1 cannot be
assigned without the consent, approval or waiver of a third person or entity
(including a Governmental Entity), or if such assignment or attempted
assignment would constitute a breach thereof or a violation of any law (each,
a "Non-Assignable Asset"), then nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an
assignment or require the assignment thereof prior to the time at which all
consents, approvals and waivers necessary for such assignment have been
obtained. To the extent and for so long as all consents, approvals and waivers
required for the assignment of any Non-Assignable Asset have not been obtained
by IMFS after the Closing, IMFS shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at
Micron Singapore's cost, to (a) provide to Micron Singapore the financial and
business benefits of such Non-Assignable Asset and (b) enforce, at the request of Micron Singapore, for
the account of Micron Singapore, any rights of IMFS arising from any such Non-
Assignable Asset (including the right to elect to terminate in accordance with
the terms thereof). Micron Singapore will perform any portion of a Non-
Assignable Asset the financial and business benefits of which are being
provided to Micron Singapore in accordance with clause (a) of the preceding
sentence to the same extent required of IMFS under the terms of such Non-
Assignable Asset (i.e., in the same (or as similar as practicable) manner and
time, and with the same quality, so required of IMFS). Following the Closing,
IMFS shall not terminate, modify or amend any Non-Assignable Asset without
Micron Singapore's prior written consent. Micron Singapore agrees that neither
IMFS nor Intel Singapore shall have any liability to Micron Singapore arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent that may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
because of any circumstances resulting therefrom, nor shall any such failure
affect the consideration payable to IMFS hereunder.

1.12 Employees.

(a) Transfer of Employees under the Employment Act. Subject to the Closing,
the transfer of the employment of the employees of IMFS on the Closing who are
protected under the Employment Act (the "Transferred Employees") shall be
governed by Section 18A of the Employment Act and IMFS and Micron Singapore
shall each comply with their respective obligations under the said Section
18A. Micron Singapore may offer the Transferred Employees new written terms
and conditions of employment, in the form determined by it, to take effect
immediately following the transfer of the employment of the Transferred
Employees. Such new terms and conditions must include a commitment by **** to
pay any installment of an **** that would otherwise fall due for payment after
the Closing Date, but such payment may be subject to materially similar
contingencies upon payment of the installment as set out in the ****. IMFS
shall use its best efforts to encourage the Transferred Employees to accept
such offers of new terms and conditions and shall assist Micron Singapore to
distribute the documents containing such new terms and conditions. If any
Transferred Employee does not accept such offer of new terms and conditions by
Micron Singapore by the Closing, such Transferred Employee shall nevertheless
automatically transfer to the employment of Micron Singapore on the Closing by
operation of the said Section 18A.

(b) Executive Employees. Micron Singapore shall make a written offer of
employment as provided in Section 1.12(c) to each Relevant Employee who will
not be a Transferred Employee (each an "Executive Employee"), which offer
shall be conditional upon the Closing (such offer shall hereinafter be
referred to as "MSA's Offer"). If any such Executive Employee accepts MSA's
Offer and commences employment with Micron Singapore as a result, the
employment of the Executive Employee with IMFS will be deemed to be terminated
by mutual consent with effect from the close of business on the day before the
Closing. **** will not pay to any **** as a result of such termination any
payment for **** nor any **** which would otherwise fall due for payment after
the Closing Date. The document recording the terms upon which the Executive
Employee's employment with IMFS terminates by mutual consent shall be in the
form customarily used by IMFS (the "Termination Agreement"). (c) MSA's Offer

(i) MSA's Offer to each Executive Employee shall be made on such terms and
conditions determined by Micron Singapore, provided that:

| 
---|--- 

A.

|

Micron Singapore agrees that any employment with Micron Singapore that
commences as a result of the Executive Employee's acceptance of MSA's Offer
shall commence upon Closing; 

| 
---|--- 

B.

|

Micron Singapore will recognize and assume liability for the **** as at
Closing; 

| 
---|--- 

C.

|

Micron Singapore must agree to pay **** which would otherwise fall due for
payment after the Closing Date, but such payment may be subject to materially
similar contingencies upon payment of the installment as set out in the ****;
and 

| 
---|--- 

D.

|

Micron Singapore will recognize each **** with **** as **** for the purpose of
determining the ****, but only to the extent to which the **** has not already
received or been provided with the **** in respect of a ****. 

(ii) IMFS shall use reasonable efforts to persuade the Executive Employees to
accept MSA's Offer and shall assist Micron Singapore to distribute MSA's Offer
to the Executive Employees, together with the Termination Agreement.

(d) Obligations Regarding the Employees

(i) IMFS shall perform and discharge all its obligations in respect of all the
Relevant Employees for its own account up to and including the day immediately
preceding the Closing. Without limitation to the foregoing, IMFS shall pay
for:

| 
---|--- 

A.

|

all salaries, emoluments and accrued leave entitlements (other than unused
annual leave for Executive Employees who accept MSA's Offer) and all other
amounts (including, without limitation, contributions payable to any provident
fund or pension scheme) due or accruing in respect of the Relevant Employees
who commence employment with Micron Singapore up to the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date; and | 
---|--- 

B.

|

all salaries, emoluments and accrued leave entitlements and all other amounts
(including, without limitation, contributions payable to any provident fund or
pension scheme) due or accruing in respect of the Executive Employees who do
not commencement employment with Micron Singapore up to the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, **** shall be
**** from and against, any and all ****.

(iii) Micron Singapore shall, at its own cost and expense, make the necessary
applications to the Ministry of Manpower (the "MOM") to obtain all work
permits and employment passes required by those of the Transferred Employees
and the Executive Employees (who have accepted MSA's Offer) who are not
Singapore citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents to work for Micron
Singapore. IMFS and Micron Singapore shall promptly co-operate with and
provide all necessary information and assistance reasonably required by the
MOM upon being requested to do so.

(e) Offers to Seconded Employees. From and after the date of this Agreement,
Micron Singapore may make offers to and hire any employees of IM Flash
Technologies, LLC and Intel Corporation or its subsidiaries who are rendering
service to IMFS as seconded personnel.

1.13 Interested Member Transactions. With respect to Micron Singapore's
purchase of the MSA Purchased Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
Micron Singapore is an Interested Member (as defined in the IMFS Agreement),
and the Parties hereby agree that any actions that are required to be or that
may be taken by IMFS in connection with the sale of the MSA Purchased Assets
to Micron Singapore as contemplated by this Agreement, including with respect
to matters described in Sections 1.6 and 5.4, may be taken by Intel Singapore
on IMFS's behalf (as contemplated by Section 6.3(B) of the IMFS Agreement) or
may be taken by IMFS only with the approval of a majority of the managers of
IMFS appointed by Intel Singapore (as contemplated by Section 6.3(B) of the
IMFS Agreement). In acting on IMFS's behalf, Intel Singapore shall not take
any action in violation of this Agreement. Each of Micron Singapore and Intel
Singapore shall, or shall cause its appointed managers to, approve the terms
of this Agreement.
