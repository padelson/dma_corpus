 **8.03** ** ****_No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies._**

 



 

No failure by Purchaser to exercise, and no delay by Purchaser in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges

 



      
 

 



 

herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies,
powers and privileges provided by law.

 



 

 **8.04** ** ****_Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver._**

 



 

(a) _Costs and Expenses_. Each of Sellers and Purchaser shall pay their
respective costs and expenses in connection with the diligence, preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the
other Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions
hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be consummated).

 



 

(b) _Indemnification by Sellers_. Sellers shall jointly and severally
indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, agents and employees (each such Person being called an "
_Indemnitee_ ") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and related expenses
(including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for
any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee
by any third party or by any Seller or any of their Subsidiaries arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of
this Agreement, any other Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective
obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or (ii) any actual or prospective claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a
third party or by a Seller or a Subsidiary, and regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto; _provided_ that such indemnity shall not, as to
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
penalties, liabilities or related expenses (A) are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or which
arose from action taken or omitted after the Closing Date or the repayment of
the Purchase Price or (B) result from a claim brought by Sellers against an
Indemnitee for breach in bad faith or a material breach of such Indemnitees
obligations hereunder or under any other Document, if Sellers have obtained a
final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Indemnitee shall be obligated to refund and return any and all amounts paid by
Sellers under this paragraph to such Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee
is not entitled to payment of such amounts in accordance with the terms
hereof.

 



 

(c) _Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc_. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, Sellers shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any
other Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

(d) _Payments_. All amounts due under this _Section 8.04_ shall be payable
not later than twenty (20) days after demand therefor.

 



 

(e) _Capitalization_. Sellers represent and covenant that on the Effective
Date, Parent will be capitalized with Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000), at least half of which will be represented by cash
consideration paid for shares of common stock of Parent.

 



 

(f) _Survival_. The agreements in this _Section 8.04_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the sale, assignment and transfer to
Purchaser of the Target Stock or the repayment of the Purchase Price.

 



      
 

 



 

 **8.05** ** ****_Revival._**

 



 

To the extent that the sale, assignment and transfer to Purchaser of the
Target Stock, or repayment of the Purchase Price, is subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by Purchaser in its commercially
reasonable discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party,
in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise,
then the obligation of Sellers, or part thereof, originally intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
transfer or repayment had not been made.

 



 

 **8.06** ** ****_Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries._**

 



 

The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that Sellers may not assign or otherwise transfer any
of their rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
Purchaser. Except as set forth in the following sentence, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, and to the extent expressly contemplated hereby,
Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason
of this Agreement. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge that Target has relied on
the obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement, and that Target is an
express third party beneficiary hereof and is entitled to enforce this
Agreement as if a Seller.

 



 

 **8.07** ** ****_Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness._**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute
an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract. The Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by telecopy or other electronic image scan transmission (e.g., "pdf"
via e-mail) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
of this Agreement.

 



 

 **8.08** ** ****_Survival of Representations and Warranties._**

 



 

All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith
or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.
Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by
Purchaser, regardless of any investigation made by Purchaser or on its behalf
and notwithstanding that Purchaser may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default. Such representations and warranties shall terminate following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date.

 



 

 **8.09** ** ****_Severability._**

 



 

If any provision of the Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of the Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b)
the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect
of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

 **8.10** ** ****_Governing Law._**

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES.

 



 

 **8.11** ** ****_Arbitration._**

 



 

(a) _Disputes_. Any disputes, claims or controversies between or among the
parties hereto (i) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) brought by or on behalf of any
shareholder of Purchaser or a Seller (which, for purposes of this _Section
8.11_, shall mean any shareholder of record or any beneficial owner of shares
in either Purchaser or a Seller, or any former shareholder of record or
beneficial owner of shares of Purchaser or a Seller) either on his, her or its
owner behalf, on behalf of either Purchaser or a Seller or on behalf of any
series of class of shares of either Purchaser or a Seller against Purchaser or
a Seller or any trustee, director officer, manager (including Reit Management
and Research LLC or its successor), agent or employee of Purchaser or a Seller,
including disputes, claims or controversies relating to the meaning,
interpretation, effect, validity, performance or enforcement of this
Agreement, including this arbitration agreement (all of which are referred to
as " _Disputes_ ") or relating in any way to such a Dispute or Disputes, shall
on the demand of any party to such Dispute be resolved through binding and
final Arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "
_Rules_ ") of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") then in effect,
except as modified herein. For the avoidance of doubt, a Dispute shall include
a Dispute made derivatively on behalf of one party against another party.

 



 

(b) _Selection of Arbitrators_. There shall be three arbitrators. If there are
only two parties to the Dispute, each party shall select one arbitrator within
15 days after receipt of a demand for arbitration. Such arbitrators may be
affiliated or interested persons of such parties. If there are more than two
parties to the Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and all respondents,
on the other hand, shall each select, by the vote of a majority of the
claimants or the respondents, as the case may be, one arbitrator within 15
days after receipt of a demand for arbitration. Such arbitrators may be
affiliated or interested persons of the claimants or the respondents, as the
case may be. If either a claimant (or all claimants) or a respondent (or all
respondents) fail to timely select an arbitrator then the party (or parties)
who has selected an arbitrator may request the AAA to provide a list of three
proposed arbitrators in accordance with the Rules (each of whom shall be
neutral, impartial and unaffiliated with any party) and the party (or parties)
that failed to timely appoint an arbitrator shall have ten days from the date
the AAA provides such list to select one of the three arbitrators proposed by
AAA. If such party (or parties) fail to select such arbitrator by such time,
the party (or parties) who have appointed the first arbitrator shall then have
ten days to select one of the three arbitrators proposed by AAA to be the
second arbitrator; and, if he/they should fail to select such arbitrator by
such time, the AAA shall select, within 15 days thereafter, one of the three
arbitrators it had proposed as the second arbitrator. The two arbitrators so
appointed shall jointly appoint the third and presiding arbitrator (who shall
be neutral, impartial and unaffiliated with any party) within 15 days of the
appointment of the second arbitrator. If the third arbitrator has not been
appointed within the time limit specified herein, then the AAA shall provide a
list of proposed arbitrators in accordance with the Rules, and the arbitrator
shall be appointed by the AAA in accordance with a listing, striking and
ranking procedure, with each party having a limited number of strikes,
excluding strikes for cause.

 



 

(c) _Location of Arbitration_. The place of Arbitration shall be Boston,
Massachusetts unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Scope of Discovery_. There shall be only limited documentary discovery of
documents directly related to the issues in dispute, as may be ordered by the
arbitrators.

 



 

(e) _Arbitration Award_. In rendering an award or decision (the " _Arbitration
Award_ "), the arbitrators shall be required to follow the laws of the State
of New York. Any arbitration proceedings or Arbitration Award rendered
hereunder and the validity, effect and interpretation of this _Section 8.11_
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. The
Arbitration Award shall be in writing and may, but shall not be required to,
briefly state the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which it is
based.

 



 

(f) _Costs_. Except to the extent expressly provided by this _Section 8.11_
or as otherwise agreed between the parties, each party involved in a Dispute
shall bear its own costs and expenses (including attorneys fees), and the
arbitrators shall not render an award that would include shifting of any such
costs or expenses (including attorneys fees). Each party (or, if there are
more than two parties to the Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and all
respondents, on the other hand, respectively) shall bear the costs and
expenses of its (or their) selected arbitrator and the parties (or, if there
are more than two parties to the Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and
all respondents, on the other hand) shall equally bear the costs and expenses
of the third appointed arbitrator.

 



 

(g) _Final Judgment_. The Arbitration Award shall be final and binding upon
the parties thereto and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between such
parties relating to the Dispute, including any claims, counterclaims, issues
or accounting presented to the arbitrators. Judgment upon the Arbitration
Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, no application or appeal to any court of competent
jurisdiction may be made in connection with any question of law arising in the
course of arbitration or with respect to any award made except for actions
relating to enforcement of this _Section 8.11_ to arbitrate or any arbitral
award issued hereunder and except for actions seeking interim or other
provisional relief in aid of arbitration proceedings in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

 



 

(h) _Payment_. Any monetary award shall be made and payable in U.S. dollars
free of any tax, deduction or offset. The party against which the Arbitration
Award assesses a monetary obligation shall pay that obligation on or before
the 30th day following the date of the Arbitration Award or such other date as
the Arbitration Award may provide.

 



 

(i) _Beneficiaries_. This _Section 8.11_ is intended to benefit and be
enforceable by the shareholders, trustees, directors, officers, managers
(including Reit Management and Research LLC or its successor), agents or
employees of any party and the parties and shall be binding on the
shareholders of any party and the parties, as applicable, and shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that such individuals or entities may have by contract or
otherwise.

 



 

 **8.12** ** ****_Remedies._** The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder
will cause irreparable and immediate harm to Target and its stockholders, for
which damages, even if available will not be an adequate remedy. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and (b) shall
be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
Law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement. All rights
and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this " _Agreement_
"), dated as of November 2, 2011, by and among Property Acquisition Corp.
(a/k/a Sonesta Acquisition Corp.), a Maryland corporation (" _Parent_ "), PAC
Merger Corp., a New York corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(" _Merger Sub_ "), and Sonesta International Hotels Corporation, a New York
corporation (originally incorporated as the Childs Company) (the " _Company_
").

 



 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the
" _Merger_ "), pursuant to which each outstanding share of the Class A common
stock, par value $0.80 per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ ") (except
for Shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to be treated as a qualified stock
purchase, without a Code Section 338 election; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (i) has adopted this Agreement,
(ii) has determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and (iii) has resolved to recommend that the holders of the
Shares (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent
as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this Agreement and approved
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition to Parents willingness to enter
into this Agreement, stockholders of the Company who hold at least a majority
of the total number of Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis are
entering into a Voting Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub simultaneously
with the execution of this Agreement, in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_, whereby, among other things, such stockholders have
agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
vote the Shares held by such stockholders in favor of adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger;

      
 

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger,
pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii) the
Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger and
shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of New York, and (iii)
the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the
Merger. The corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred
to as the " _Surviving Corporation_." The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the New York Business
Corporation Law (the " _NYBCL_ ").

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically
to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated certificate of
incorporation shall become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the NYBCL and such certificate of incorporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that at the Effective Time the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Sonesta International Hotels Corporation".

 



 

(c) The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except as to the name
of the Surviving Corporation, which shall be "Sonesta International Hotels
Corporation" until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and
filed on the Closing Date with the Department of State of the State of New
York as provided in the NYBCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date
and time on which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Department of State of the State of New York, or such later time as agreed
upon by the parties, such time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective
Time_."

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the parties
(the " _Closing Date_ "), subject to the following sentence, such date to be
no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of
the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (excluding conditions that, by
their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, One Beacon Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02108, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by
the parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Closing Date
shall not occur, and the Closing shall not take place before, January 3, 2012
without the prior written consent of Parent and if the Closing Date would be
on a day that is less than two Business Days prior to the end of a calendar
quarter, the Closing Date shall at Parents request be the first Business Day
after the end of such quarter.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
unless otherwise requested in writing by Parent, shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, that any
actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or
Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest
all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company and the bylaws of the Company, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Company Stockholders
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company
Stockholders  Meeting_") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") confirms that it has no
comments or no further comments, as the case may be, to the Proxy Statement,
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Any
adjournments or postponements of the Company Stockholders Meeting or any
recess of the Company Stockholders Meeting beyond the originally scheduled
meeting date (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) shall require the prior
written consent of Parent. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit from holders of Shares proxies in favor of adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger and to take all actions reasonably
necessary or advisable

 



      
 

 



 

to secure the approval of stockholders required by the NYBCL, the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and any other applicable Law to effect
the Merger.

 



 

(b) In accordance with applicable Law, promptly after the date hereof, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement
relating to the Merger and this Agreement (together with any amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments
on the Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall
consider in good faith any revisions suggested by Parent or Merger Sub. The
Company agrees to provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel (i) in writing
with any comments or communications that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any oral
or written responses thereto and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide
comments on the proposed response of the Company to those comments and to
participate with the Company in any material discussions or meetings with the
SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain and
furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy
Statement, (ii) subject to the preceding sentence, respond promptly to any
comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, (iii) cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as soon as reasonably
practicable, which Proxy Statement shall include all information required
under applicable Law to be furnished to the Company Stockholders in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
include the Company Board Recommendation and the full text of the written
opinion described in _Section 3.24_, and (iv) obtain the necessary approvals
of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders.

 



 

(c) If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any information
relating to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, executive officers or directors, should become known to Parent
or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties

ARTICLE II

 



 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any securities of the Company, the following shall
occur:

 



 

(a) Each of the 10 outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "), in the capital of Merger Sub, all of
which are entitled to vote on the Merger, shall be converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock in the capital of Merger Sub is subject to change if
Merger Sub issues, and Parent purchases, additional shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock.

 



 

(b) All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or
the Company shall be cancelled and retired, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) Each outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_) shall be converted into the right to receive $31.00
per Share, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest and subject
to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
_Section 2.3_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective
Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired, and each holder of record of a certificate (or
certificates) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and each holder of Shares that
immediately prior to the Effective Time were not represented by

 



      
 

 



 

Certificates (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Book Entry Shares
in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest thereon.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Paying Agent; Surrender of Shares_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate an agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger and
to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.1(c)_. At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited on its behalf, with the Paying Agent
cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed in writing by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying
Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and
no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event within five Business
Days), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
Certificates and each holder of Book Entry Shares, whose Shares were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
(i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of Certificates, shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
(i) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as Parent or the
Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Book Entry Shares, and such other documents as may be required by Parent or
the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and the Certificate or Book
Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or the Book Entry Share is registered, it
shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) either the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book Entry Share shall be properly transferred, and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required to be paid by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
Book Entry Share transferred or shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that each such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_,
each Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) All Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_ARTICLE II_ shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by
such Certificates or to the Book Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall
be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company.

 



 

(d) At any time following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to
the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book Entry
Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book Entry
Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or
any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law or under any other
applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Persons to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. The
Company represents that (i) the Shares are listed on Nasdaq, and (ii) since at
least January 1, 2011 there have been at least two brokers and/or dealers
making a market in the Shares as contemplated by Section 1.897-9T(d)(2) of the
Treasury Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, if the representations in
the preceding sentence remain true and correct as of the Effective Time and
the certificate referred to in the next sentence is timely delivered, the
disposition of Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall not be subject to
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code. Prior to the day preceding, but no
earlier than one week before, the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver a
certificate that identifies at least two brokers and/or dealers making a
market in the Shares as contemplated by Section 1.897-9T(d)(2) of the Treasury
Regulations through the Effective Time. If (i) any representation or warranty
in this _Section 2.3_ is not true and correct in all respects or (ii) the
Company fails to deliver the certificate contemplated in this _Section 2.3_,
each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and

 



      
 

 



 

withhold any amounts required to be withheld under Section 1445 of the Code.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any such breach, (i) the breach
shall not release Parent or Merger Sub from their obligations to effect the
Transactions, and (ii) there shall be no withholding under Section 1445 of the
Code if the Company establishes alternative reasons (reasonably satisfactory
to Parent) that such withholding is not required.

taking of such action without the consent of Parent would breach this
Agreement; and (B) Parent refused to consent to such action after the Company
requested Parents consent to such action and provided disclosure to Parent of
all relevant information (but the

 



      
 

 



 

underlying facts giving rise to such request shall not, by this clause (vi),
be excluded from this definition);

 



 

(vii) the failure, in and of itself, of the Company to meet any internal or
published projections or forecasts (but the underlying facts and cause of such
failure shall not, by this clause (vii), be excluded from this definition);

hurricane, tornado, flood, landslide, fire, acts of war, terrorist activities
or other casualty affecting 50% or more of the Companys hotel in Cambridge,

Section 3.8 _Company SEC Documents and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2008, the Company has timely filed with the SEC all
forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other documents required
by it to be filed under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (collectively,
the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to
the reporting requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As of
its filing date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the
date of the last such amendment, each Company SEC Document complied as to form
in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date or, if
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. All of the audited financial statements and unaudited
interim financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ ") filed prior to the
date of this Agreement (i) comply in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and with the rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as

 



      
 

 



 

expressly disclosed in the notes thereto), and (iii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position and the results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance
with GAAP (subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments, in each case as permitted by GAAP
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC) as of the
times and for the periods referred to therein. Other than as expressly
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, there
has been no material change in the Companys accounting methods or principles
that would be required to be disclosed in the Companys financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. The books of account and other financial records of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are true and complete in all material
respects.

 



 

(b) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct copies
of all comment letters from the SEC staff since January 1, 2008 through the
date of this Agreement with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company
SEC Documents.

 



 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and governance
rules and regulations of Nasdaq.

 



 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and
procedures sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that the Company and
its Subsidiaries maintain records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the Companys and its Subsidiaries transactions and
dispositions of assets, (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (iii) that
receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the Board of Directors of the Company, and (iv) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets that could have a
material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The
Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q (or any amendment thereto) its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. The Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors and the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors (and made available to Parent a summary of
the significant aspects of such disclosure) (A) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a

 



      
 

 



 

significant role in the Companys or its Subsidiaries internal control over
financial reporting. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed
prior to the date hereof, the Company has not identified any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2010, there have
been no material changes in the Companys and its Subsidiaries internal
control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) The Companys and its Subsidiaries "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are
reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

 



 

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no SEC or other governmental
inquiries or investigations or internal investigations pending or threatened
in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by the Company or any current or former
director, officer, employee, agent, independent contractor or franchisee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2008, there have been
no internal investigations regarding accounting or compliance with Laws
discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the chief
executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel or similar legal
officer, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof.

applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company does not
have, and has not arranged any, outstanding "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to, nor
does it have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet

 



      
 

 



 

arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where
the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any

Company SEC Documents.

defined by Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, for senior financial
officers, applicable to its principal executive officer, principal financial
officer, controller or principal accounting officer, or persons performing
similar functions. The Company has promptly disclosed any change in or waiver
of the Companys code of ethics with respect to any such persons, as required
by Section 406(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the knowledge of the Company,
there have been no violations of provisions of the Companys code of ethics by
any such persons.

by this Agreement, since December 31, 2010, (a) the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their business in all material respects only in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (b) there has
been no Change that individually or in the aggregate has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (c) the
Company has not taken, or failed to take, any action that, if taken, or failed
to be taken, after the date of this Agreement, would violate _Section 5.1_.

 



 

Section 3.11 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for (a) liabilities
reflected in the Financial Statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K or Form
10-Q since December 31, 2010 and prior to the date of this Agreement and (b)
for liabilities and obligations (i) incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2010 or (ii) as have
not had, and as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether

to be reflected in the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

Section 3.12 _Litigation; Orders_. There is no suit, claim, action, charge,
proceeding, including, without limitation, any arbitration proceeding or

(i) involves an amount in controversy in excess of $100,000, (ii) seeks
material injunctive or other non-monetary relief, or (iii) individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions. No judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
Governmental Entity is outstanding against the Company or any of its

(a) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC since
January 1, 2008, there exists no employment, consulting, retention, change in
control, severance, termination or similar agreement, arrangement or
understanding (collectively, the " _Employment Agreements_ ") between the
Company and any individual current or former employee, officer or director of,
or consultant to, the Company or any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated, that, together with the Company would be deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ").

 



 

(b) _Section 3.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct
and complete list of all (i) "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ ")) (sometimes referred to herein as " _Pension Plans_ "),

is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the " _Multiemployer
Pension Plans_ "), (ii) "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), and (iii) all other benefit or compensation plans,

consulting, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, insurance, stock purchase,
stock option, incentive or equity compensation or other welfare or fringe
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or practice sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to, by the Company,
any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, for the benefit of any
current or former employees, officers, consultants or directors of the Company
or an ERISA Affiliate, or with respect to which the Company, its Subsidiaries
or an ERISA Affiliate could reasonably have any liability (collectively, the "
_Benefit Plans_ "). The Company has delivered or made available to Parent and
Merger Sub correct and complete copies of (i) each Benefit Plan and Employment
Agreement (including all amendments thereto) or complete written descriptions
of each Benefit Plan or Employment Agreement that is not otherwise in writing,
(ii) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 and all schedules thereto
filed with respect to each Benefit Plan, to the extent applicable, (iii) the
most recent summary plan description, summary of material modifications and
plan prospectus for each Benefit Plan, to the extent applicable, (iv) each
current trust agreement, insurance contract or policy, group annuity contract
and any other funding arrangement relating to any Benefit Plan, to the extent

Service favorable determination letter or opinion letter on which the Company
or its ERISA Affiliate is entitled to rely, to the extent applicable, (vii)
all material correspondence to or from any Governmental Entity relating to any
Benefit Plan, and (viii) all discrimination tests for each Benefit Plan for
the three most recent plan years, to the extent applicable.

 



 

(c) Each Benefit Plan is and has at all times been operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance in all
material respects with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. Each
Benefit Plan and

 



      
 

 



 

Employment Agreement has been administered in good faith compliance with
Section 409A of the Code to the extent applicable.

 



 

(d) Each Pension Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code has received a recent and currently effective determination
letter (or is entitled to rely on a currently effective opinion letter) from
the Internal Revenue Service that such Pension Plan is so qualified and that
its related trust is exempt from taxation under Section 401(a) and 501(a) of
the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification.

 



 

(e) None of the Benefit Plans is, and the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company and any ERISA Affiliate of either have never maintained or been a
party to, or had an obligation to contribute to, (i) a "single employer plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) subject to Section
412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA (a " _Title IV Plan_ "), (ii) a "multiple
employer plan" or "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as such terms are
defined in ERISA), or (iii) a funded welfare benefit plan (as such term is
defined in Section 419 of the Code). There are no unpaid contributions due
prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Benefit Plan that are
required to have been made under the terms of such Benefit Plan, any related
insurance contract or any applicable Law and all contributions due have been
timely made.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, nor any ERISA
Affiliate has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined
in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of
fiduciary responsibility with respect to any Benefit Plan that reasonably
could be expected to subject the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate to any material tax or penalty.

 



 

(g) With respect to any Benefit Plan: (i) no filing, application or other
matter is pending with the Internal Revenue Service, the United States
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity, and (ii) there is no
action, suit, audit, investigation or claim pending, or to the Companys
knowledge, threatened or anticipated, other than routine claims for benefits.
There is no contract or arrangement, plan or agreement by or with the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company (including Benefit Plans and Employment
Agreements) covering any person that, individually or collectively, could give
rise to the payment of any amount by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company that would not be deductible by the Company by reason of Section 280G
or Section 162(m) of the Code. No Benefit Plan or Employment Agreement
provides for any gross-up or similar payment with respect to Taxes which may
be incurred in connection therewith.

 



 

(h) The Company, its Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliates of either have no
obligations to provide any health benefits or other non-pension benefits
(whether or not insured) to retired or other former employees, directors or
consultants, except as specifically required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA ("
_COBRA_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Neither the negotiation or the execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby will, either alone
or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to any payment or benefit (or result in the funding of any such
payment or benefit) or result in any forgiveness of indebtedness with respect
to any such persons, (ii) increase the amount of any compensation, equity
award or other benefits otherwise payable by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, funding
or vesting of any compensation, equity award or other benefits, or (iv) result
in the imposition of any restriction on the ability to amend or terminate any
Benefit Plan or Employment Agreement.

 



 

(j) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to the law of any
jurisdiction outside the United States (each, a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ "):
(i) all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan
required by Law or by the terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan have been timely
made, or, if applicable, accrued, in accordance with applicable accounting
practices; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign
Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan
funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign
Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing,
with respect to all current and former participants in such plan according to
the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and (iii) each Foreign
Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been
maintained in good standing with applicable Governmental Entities.

 



 

(k) Each Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without material liability
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or at any time after the Closing.

requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or any Company Representative, in each case, in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or the possibility or consideration of
making an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify the name of the
Person making such proposal or request or seeking such negotiations or
discussions and include copies of all correspondence and written materials
provided to the Company or any Company Representative that describe the terms
and conditions of any proposal or request and a reasonable description of any
terms and conditions of any such proposal or request that were communicated
orally.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.2(a)_, prior to the receipt of Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.2_, furnish non-public information concerning its business,
properties or assets to any Person pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a
copy of which shall be provided to Parent promptly after its execution) with
terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreements, dated March 11, 2011 and March 16, 2011, each
entered into between HPT and the Company (together, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") and may negotiate and participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person concerning an Acquisition Proposal if, but only
if, (i) the Company has received on an unsolicited basis, a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from such Person, (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after considering the advice of a nationally
recognized investment banking firm and outside legal counsel that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after considering the advice of outside legal counsel to the
Company, that the failure to provide such information or to engage in such
discussions or negotiations would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, and (iv)
there has not been any material breach of this _Section 5.2_ by the Company
or any of its Representatives.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Prior to furnishing any Person with information or entering into
negotiations or discussions pursuant to _Section 5.2(b)_, the Company shall
provide Parent at least 24 hours prior written notice of its intention to
provide such information or enter into such negotiations or discussions, which
notice shall include the name of the Person to whom it intends to provide such
information or enter into such negotiations or discussions. The Company shall
promptly provide to Parent any non-public information regarding the Company
provided to any other Person which was not previously provided to Parent, such
additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of
such information to such other Person. The Company shall promptly keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and details of any Acquisition Proposal
(including any material changes in the terms thereof) and promptly deliver
copies of all correspondence and written materials provided to the Company or
any Company Representative with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (and any
subsequent material changes to such terms and conditions thereof) and a
reasonable description of any terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal
that were communicated orally.

 



 

(d) Any violation of this _Section 5.2_ by any of the Companys
Representatives, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and
whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.2(e)_, neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall make an Adverse
Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of
Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may make
an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal if (i)
the Company shall have received a Superior Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of this _Section 5.2_ and provided the notice specified in
_Section 5.2(c)_, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after considering the advice of outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (iii)
prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company has provided Parent four full Business Days
prior written notice that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new
written notice to Parent and a new two full Business Day period), (iv) during
such period (and any new two full Business Day period required by this
_Section 5.2(e)_) the Company has caused its financial and legal advisors to
negotiate with Parent in good faith as to any such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent so as to cause such
Acquisition Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (v)
following such period(s), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its good faith judgment (after considering the advice of its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that, after taking into account any adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, the
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any such
Adverse Recommendation Change or the entry by the Company into any Acquisition
Agreement shall not change the approval of the

 



      
 

 



 

Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing or cause any state
takeover statute or other state Law to be applicable to the Transactions
(including the Merger).

 



 

(f) The Company may terminate this Agreement and enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), provided
that, prior to any such termination (and with respect to clause (iii) hereof,
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement), (i) the Company shall
have received a Superior Proposal and provided the notice specified in
_Section 5.2(c)_, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in

failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) the
Company shall have provided Parent four full Business Days prior written
notice (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a
new written notice to Parent and a new two full Business Day period) that it
intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.2(f)_,
identifying the Superior Proposal then determined to be more favorable and the
parties thereto and delivering to Parent a copy of the Acquisition Agreement
for such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into, (iv) during such
period (and any new two full Business Day period required by this _Section
5.2(f)_) the Company has caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate
with Parent in good faith as to any such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent so as to cause such
Acquisition Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, (v) following
such period(s), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good
faith judgment (after considering the advice of its financial advisor and
outside legal advisor) that, after taking into account any adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, the
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, (vi) there
has not been any material breach of this _Section 5.2_ by the Company or any
of its Representatives, (vii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent (1) a
written notice of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section

following and conditioned on the payment of the Termination Fee and the
Reimbursable Expenses pursuant to subclause (2) above, the Company enters into
the Acquisition Agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal for which it
has complied with the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.2_.

 



 

(g) The Company shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 912 of the NYBCL (or any similar
provision of any other Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply
or (ii) exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates) from the provisions on "control share acquisitions" contained in
any takeover Law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or agree
to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless such actions are taken
substantially concurrently with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 5.2(f)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, if in either case, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors
of the Company, after considering the advice of outside counsel to the
Company, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board
of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law.

substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
Parent. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may
reasonably request. Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will
make (or cause to be made) all necessary payments to fund the contributions
(i) necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any such
401(k) Plan, (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to any such 401(k) Plan

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any
of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or amend, terminate or otherwise modify any benefit plan
following the Closing Date or shall be construed as an amendment to any
Benefit Plan. The provisions contained in this _Section 6.11_ are included
for the sole benefit of the Company and Parent and nothing in this _Section
6.11_, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or
other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any

proceeds of the Funding on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Funding Agreements, including using their respective reasonable best efforts
(i) to satisfy all conditions and covenants set forth in the Funding
Agreements that are applicable to Parent or Merger Sub and that are within
their respective control, and (ii) provided the conditions to Parents and
Merger Subs obligations to effect the Merger set forth in _ARTICLE VII,_ the
conditions to funding of the Equity Financing set forth in the Equity
Commitment Agreement and the conditions to advance of the Purchase Funding set
forth in the HPT Purchase Agreement are satisfied (or any such condition set
forth in _ARTICLE VII_ which is not so satisfied is waived in writing by
Parent and Merger Sub, any condition to funding not so satisfied is waived in
writing by the Investors and any condition to the advance of the Purchase
Funding under the HPT Purchase Agreement not so satisfied is waived in writing

 



      
 

 



 

by HPT), cause HPT to advance the Purchase Funding and the Investors to fund
the Equity Financing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the
Merger).

 



 

(b) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other provision under any Funding Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such amendments,
modifications or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Funding
(unless the Equity Financing or Purchase Funding, as the case may be, is
increased by an amount corresponding to such reduction) or (ii) impose new or
additional conditions that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
or (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its
rights against HPT under the HPT Purchase Agreement or the Investors under the
Equity Commitment Agreement. Parent shall not release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of HPT under the HPT Purchase Agreement or the
Investors under the Equity Commitment Agreement.

change of its name to "Sonesta Acquisition Corp." and agrees to provide to

of Cambridge) that has an excess loss account set forth on _Section 3.14(m)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall either (i) liquidate or
merge such Subsidiary out of existence in a manner that eliminates the excess
loss account (but does not trigger or restore into income any excess loss
account) or (ii) contribute sufficient assets (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, may include an intercompany receivable) to such Subsidiary to eliminate
any excess loss account in such Subsidiary from and after the contribution and
through the Closing (assuming, for this purpose, that the Closing shall take
place no later than March 31, 2012). At least three days in advance of
implementing the foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent documents
intended to effect the foregoing for Parents reasonable review and comment.

not been cured within the earlier of (1) fifteen days after the giving of

Section 8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

9.11_, _Section 9.13_, _Section 9.14_, _Section 9.15_ and this _Section
8.2_, which shall survive such termination) and there shall be no liability on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, except (i) as set forth in this
_Section 8.2_, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company from liability for its fraud or willful and material breach of
this Agreement but such liability shall be subject to the Damages Cap.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If:

 



 

(i) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(i)_; or

 



 

(ii) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_ as a result of a willful breach of _Section 5.2_; or

 



 

(iii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(i)_; or

 



 

(iv) (A) either Parent or the Company shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or Parent shall
have terminated this Agreement pursuant _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_, (B) prior to termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_, _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_, a Person shall have made an Acquisition Proposal or expressed
any interest publicly or to the Company with respect to the making of an
Acquisition Proposal, and (C) either (1) within 12 months after any such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal was made prior
to the termination of this Agreement) and in the case of a termination by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, the
transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal (or an amended version
thereof) is consummated (whether such consummation is within such 12 months or
thereafter), or (2) within 12 months after any such termination, an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal
was made prior to the termination of this Agreement);

 



 

then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $4,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), plus (to the extent not already paid pursuant to
_Section 8.2(c)_) an amount equal to Parents out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including, without limitation, legal, investment banking, accounting, banking
and consulting fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with the due diligence investigation, the Merger, this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby (subject to
reasonable documentation), but not in excess of $500,000 (the " _Reimbursable
Expenses_ ") (A) concurrently with such termination in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, (B) within one Business Days
after such termination in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(i)_ or a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ as a result of
a willful breach of _Section 5.2, _(C) upon the earlier of the entry into an
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of an
Acquisition Proposal in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ (not required to be paid
earlier under subclause (B)), and upon consummation of an Acquisition Proposal
in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_. The Termination Fee and Reimbursable Expenses shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to

 



      
 

 



 

such account as Parent may designate in writing to the Company. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that, in the circumstances in which
the Termination Fee becomes payable, the payment of the Termination Fee and
the Reimbursable Expenses in accordance with this Agreement, (A) constitutes
liquidated damages, (B) subject to _Section 8.2(a)_ and _Section 9.9_, is
the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub and (C) is
not a penalty, but rather a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent an
amount equal to the Reimbursable Expenses as promptly as possible, but in any
event within two Business Days after Parent or Merger Subs delivery of an
invoice therefor (with reasonable documentation of such expenses). The payment
of Reimbursable Expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.2(c)_ shall not relieve
the Company from any obligation to pay the applicable Termination Fee pursuant
to _Section 8.2(b)_.

 



 

(d) If the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the
Companys out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including, without limitation,
legal, investment banking, accounting, banking and consulting fees and
expenses) incurred by the Company in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby
(subject to reasonable documentation), but not in excess of $500,000 as
promptly as possible, but in any event within two Business Days after the
Companys delivery of an invoice therefor (with reasonable documentation of
such expenses).

 



 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) none of HPT or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
shareholders, directors, trustees, officers or Affiliates (collectively, the "
_HPT Related Persons_ ") shall have any liability to the Company or any other
Person, whether in contract, tort or some other theory of liability, for any
claim, action or proceeding arising out of or related to the HPT Purchase
Agreement, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the HPT Purchase
Agreement or this Agreement, or any breach or failure to perform hereunder or
thereunder, except as and to the extent expressly provided for in the HPT
Purchase Agreement; and (ii) the Investors shall have no liability to the
Company or any other Person, whether in contract, tort or some other theory of
liability, for any claim, action or proceeding arising out of or related to
the Equity Commitment Agreement, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Agreement or this Agreement, or any
breach or failure to perform hereunder or thereunder, except as and to the
extent expressly provided for in the Equity Commitment Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall the Company or its stockholders be
entitled to monetary damages in excess of an aggregate of $8,500,000 (the "
_Damages Cap_ "), inclusive of amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)_,
and (ii) while prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 9.9_
and monetary

 



      
 

 



 

damages, under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to receive both
a grant of specific performance and monetary damages. The provisions of this
_Section 8.2(e)_ are intended to be for the benefit of the HPT Related
Persons and the Investors.

Courts_ "), preserving, however, all rights of removal to the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441,
assuming such jurisdiction exists, in connection with all disputes arising out
of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and agrees not to commence any Litigation relating thereto except in
such courts. Each such party hereby waives the right to any other jurisdiction
or venue for any Litigation arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to which any of them may be
entitled by reason of its present or future domicile. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each such party agrees that each of the other parties shall have
the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment
entered by the Massachusetts Courts, or the United States District Court for
District of Massachusetts if the action was removed, in any other court or

the event of any breach of this Agreement, each non-breaching party would be

Law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled at Law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) after a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, no party shall have any right to compel
specific performance of any Section of this Agreement other than the Sections
of this Agreement that _Section 8.2(a)_ expressly provides survive such
termination, and (y) any action for specific performance commenced by the
Company prior to termination of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver by the Company of its right to terminate this Agreement if otherwise
available to the Company under _Section 8.1_.

 



 

(b) Subject to the Damages Cap, the Company has the right, prior to the
Effective Time, to pursue damages of any type, including, without limitation,
consequential or loss of the economic benefits of the Merger to stockholders,

Section 9.11 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or between any of
them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof (provided that the
provisions of this Agreement shall supersede any conflicting provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement). Except as provided in _Section 6.5_, _Section
8.2(e)_ and the last sentence of this _Section 9.11_, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, other than if the
Effective Time occurs, the right to receive payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _ARTICLE II_, which the holders of Certificates and
Book Entry Shares are entitled to enforce after the Effective Time. Peter J.
Sonnabend shall have the right to enforce _Section 6.11(d)_ and _Section
6.11(e)_ of this Agreement on behalf of the Company after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to give effect to the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR CONCERNING THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY INITIATES SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Parent, one or more
Affiliates of Parent, or a combination thereof, at any time. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 9.16 _Performance of Merger Sub_. Parent hereby guarantees the due
prompt and faithful performance and discharge by Merger Sub of its obligation
to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof and of all
