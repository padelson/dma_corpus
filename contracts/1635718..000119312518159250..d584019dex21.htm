have thirty (30) calendar days within which to review the matters raised in
the Company Equityholders Objection Notice. At the end of such thirty
(30)-calendar-day review period for the Purchaser, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith for a period of up to thirty (30) calendar days (the "
_Negotiation Period_ ") to resolve all Disputed Items; _provided_ , _however_
, that if such disputes are not resolved within such Negotiation Period,
either the Purchaser or the Equityholder Representative may elect to submit
any remaining Disputed Items (collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to an
Independent Accountant as provided in Section 2.11(g).

(e) If a Confirmation Certificate is delivered by or on behalf of the
Equityholder Representative pursuant to Section 2.11(c), or if the
Equityholder Representative does not deliver a Company Equityholders
Objection Notice within thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and Final Closing Statement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.11(c), the Final Closing Statement, together
with the Purchasers calculation of each of the Adjustment Items, shall be
deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement and shall
be deemed to be Final and Binding on the parties to this Agreement. In the
event that the Equityholder Representative delivers a Company Equityholders
Objection Notice in accordance with Section 2.11(c), (i) only the Disputed
Items specified in the Company Equityholders Objection Notice shall be deemed
to be disputed, and all other items included in the Final Closing Balance
Sheet and Final Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by all
of the parties to this Agreement and shall be deemed to be Final and Binding
on the parties to this Agreement and (ii) if the Purchaser and
the Equityholder Representative are able to resolve any or all of the
Disputed Items by mutual agreement (whether before or after submission of any
such items to the Independent Accountant), the resolution of the parties as to
such Disputed Item(s) shall be reduced to writing and shall be deemed to be
Final and Binding on all of the parties to this Agreement. In the event that
the Equityholder Representative delivers a Company Equityholders Objection
Notice in accordance with Section 2.11(c) and the Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative are unable to resolve any of the Disputed Items by
mutual agreement, the determination of the Independent Accountant as to such
Unresolved Items (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.11(g))
shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement
and shall be Final and Binding on the parties to this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such determination by the Independent Accountant is
subject to collateral attack in the case of actual fraud or a manifest error
in calculations. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final and Binding_ " shall
mean that the aforesaid determinations shall have the same preclusive effect
for all purposes as if such determinations had been embodied in a final
judgment, no longer subject to appeal, entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Net
Working Capital

 



26 ##### Table of Contents

  

 and the Unpaid Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.11(e) shall be referred to herein, respectively, as the " _Final
Closing Cash_ ," the " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ," the " _Final Closing
Net Working Capital_ ," and the " _Final Unpaid Transaction Expenses_." If the
Final Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital, such excess will be deemed the " _Final Working Capital Surplus_." If
the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital, such shortfall will be deemed the " _Final Working Capital
Deficiency_."

(f) Within five (5) Business Days following approval of the Final Closing
Balance Sheet and the final determination of each of the Adjustment Items in
accordance with Section 2.11(e), the following shall occur:

 

(i) if the Closing Consideration exceeds the Adjusted Closing Consideration by
more than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), the Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
joint written instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the
General Escrow Fund and deliver to the Purchaser an amount in cash equal to
the lesser of (A) the entire amount of the difference between the Closing
Consideration and the Adjusted Closing Consideration, without interest (such
amount, the " _Shortfall Amount_ ") and (B) all amounts remaining in the
General Escrow Fund; and

(ii) if the Adjusted Closing Consideration exceeds the Closing Consideration
by more than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), the Purchaser shall pay to the
Company Equityholders, in the manner specified in Section 2.13, an aggregate
amount in cash equal to entire amount of the difference between the Adjusted
Closing Consideration and the Closing Consideration, without interest. The
Purchaser shall have the right to withhold and set off against any amount
otherwise due to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.11(f)(ii) any amount
definitively determined to be owed to the Purchaser by the Company
Equityholders pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement prior to the date such
amount otherwise due to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.11(f)(ii) becomes
due.

 

(g) From and after the end of the Negotiation Period, either party may elect
to submit any Unresolved Items for decision to PricewaterhouseCoopers, or if
PricewaterhouseCoopers is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity,
another independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing that has
not provided material services to Purchaser or the Company within the two-
year period immediately preceding the date of such accounting firms
appointment and that is mutually agreed to by the Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative, each acting in good faith (the "
_Independent Accountant_ "), which Independent Accountant shall resolve the
Unresolved Items and adjust the calculation of each of the Adjustment Items,
as applicable, to reflect such resolution. Notice regarding the submission of
Unresolved Items to the Independent Accountant, as well as all other notices
required or permitted under this Section 2.11(g), must be in writing and sent
in accordance with Section 11.6. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to, provide full cooperation
to the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall (i) act in its
capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator, (ii) consider only the
Unresolved Items ( _provided_  that at any time the Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative may agree to settle any Unresolved Items, and
following any such agreement, any such item

 



27 ##### Table of Contents

  

 shall cease to be an "Unresolved Item" hereunder), and (iii) be instructed
to reach its conclusions regarding any Unresolved Items as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after its appointment,
and provide a written explanation of its decision. In the event that the
Purchaser or the Equityholder Representative shall submit any Unresolved Items
to the Independent Accountant, each such party may submit a "position paper"
to the Independent Accountant setting forth the position of such party with
respect to such Unresolved Items, to be considered by such Independent
Accountant as it deems fit.

 

(h) The dispute resolution procedure set forth in this Section 2.11 shall be
the exclusive dispute resolution mechanic for determining any Disputed Item,
and each of the parties hereto agrees that it shall not have any right to, and
shall not, institute any Litigation challenging any such determination or with
respect to the matters that are the subject of this Section 2.11, except that
the foregoing shall not preclude any Litigation to enforce such determination
or to compel any party to perform its obligations under this Section 2.11 in
accordance with its terms. Each of the Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative (from funds in the Equityholder Representative
Expense Fund, on behalf of the Company Equityholders) will bear its own costs
and expenses in connection with the resolution of such disputes, except that
all fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent
Accountant shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Purchaser and fifty
percent (50%) by the Equityholder Representative (from funds in the
Equityholder Representative Expense Fund, on behalf of the Company
Equityholders). For the avoidance of doubt, neither this Section 2.11 nor any
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be subject to any state or
federal arbitration law.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any payments
made to the Company Equityholders pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be
treated by the parties as an adjustment to the consideration payable to the
Company Equityholders for all Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted by
Applicable Law.

 

2.12 Earn-Out.

 

(a) _Earn-Out Payments_. If, and only if, the Revenue for a particular Earn-
Out Period Quarter is equal to or greater than 80% of the Revenue Target for
such Earn-Out Period Quarter, then in addition to any other amounts payable
hereunder, the Purchaser shall pay to the Company Equityholders, at such time
after the Closing Date as specified herein and in the manner specified
in Section 2.13, an aggregate amount with respect to such Earn-Out Period
Quarter equal to (i) the Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Period Quarter,
_minus_ (ii) any Excess Spend Penalty for such Earn-Out Period Quarter, 
_minus_ (iii) any Operating Area Excess Expense Amounts for such Earn-Out
Period Quarter (such amount, with respect to any Earn-Out Period Quarter, the
" _Adjusted Earn-Out Amount_ "), subject to a deduction for any applicable
Earn-Out Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.12(c). If the Revenue for
a particular Earn-Out Period Quarter does not equal or exceed at least 80% of
the Revenue Target for such Earn-Out Period Quarter, no Earn-Out Amount
or Adjusted Earn-Out Amount will be payable for such Earn-Out Period Quarter.
The aggregate of all Adjusted Earn-Out Amounts payable with respect to all
2018 Earn-Out Period Quarters pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) is referred to
herein as the " _2018 Earn-Out Payment_ " and the aggregate of all Adjusted
Earn-Out Amounts payable with respect to all 2019 Earn-Out Period Quarters
pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) is referred to herein as the " _2019 Earn-
Out Payment_."

reasonably detailed explanations for any deviations between the Adjusted

its designated representatives with reasonable access to the books and records
of the Company in the possession of, or under the control of, the Purchaser

commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information to the
Equityholder Representative in a manner that would not adversely affect
such privilege, including by entering into customary joint defense agreements
with the Equityholder Representative or similar arrangements with respect

fraud or a manifest error in calculations. The date upon which the Earn-Out
Payment with respect to any Earn-Out Period becomes Final and Binding upon the
parties as provided in this Section 2.12(b)(v) is referred to herein as the "
_Earn-Out Determination Date_ ".

may elect to submit any Unresolved Earn-Out Items for decision to the
Independent Accountant, which Independent Accountant shall resolve the
Unresolved Earn-Out Items and adjust the calculation of each of the Earn-Out
Items for any applicable Earn-Out Period, as well as the calculation of the
resulting Earn-Out Payment and any Earn-Out Transaction Expense Deduction
Amount (if applicable), to reflect such resolution. Notice regarding

_provided_ that at any time the Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative
may agree to settle any Unresolved Earn-Out Items, and following any such

hereunder), and (iii) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding any
Unresolved Earn-Out Items as promptly as practicable, but in any event within
thirty (30) days after its appointment, and provide a written explanation of
its decision. In the event that the Purchaser or the Equityholder
Representative shall submit any Unresolved Earn-Out Items to the Independent
Accountant, each such party may submit a "position paper" to the Independent
Accountant setting forth the position of such party with respect to such
Unresolved Earn-Out Items, to be considered by such Independent Accountant as
it deems fit.

 

(vii) The dispute resolution procedure set forth in this Section 2.12(b) shall
be the exclusive dispute resolution mechanic for determining any Disputed
Earn-Out Item, and each of the parties hereto agrees that it shall not have
any right to, and shall not, institute any Litigation challenging any such

 accordance with its terms. Each of the Purchaser and the Equityholder
Representative (from funds in the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund, on
behalf of the Company Equityholders) will bear its own costs and expenses in
connection with the resolution of such disputes, except that all fees and
expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Accountant shall be
paid by the Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative (from funds in the
Equityholder Representative Expense Fund, on behalf of the Company
Equityholders) in proportion to the amounts by which their respective
calculations of the applicable Earn-Out Payment differ from the Earn-Out
Payment as finally determined by the Independent Accountant.

(c) _Earn-Out Transaction Expenses_. The parties hereto acknowledge that
certain Transaction Expenses may become payable by the Company in the event
that an Earn-Out Payment or Acceleration Amount is determined to be payable to
the Company Equityholders hereunder, which may include fees and expenses
payable to financial advisors, investment bankers and brokers of the Company
(any such Transaction Expenses, the " _Earn-Out Transaction Expenses_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained herein, the Purchaser shall
have the right to deduct from any amount otherwise due to be paid to the
Company Equityholders pursuant to this Section 2.12 any such Earn-Out
Transaction Expenses. The Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay any Earn-
Out Transaction Expenses so deducted to the Person to whom such Earn-
Out Transaction Expenses are owed in accordance with the Contract pursuant to
which such Earn-Out Transaction Expenses are payable.

(d)  _Timing of Payment of Earn-Out Payments_. Any Earn-Out Payment (less any
applicable Earn-Out Transaction Expenses deducted pursuant to Section 2.12(c))
that the Purchaser is required to pay pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be
paid to the Company Equityholders, in the manner specified in Section 2.13,
no later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the applicable Earn-Out
Determination Date.

 

(e) _Post-Closing Operation of the Company_. The parties hereto acknowledge
that during the Earn-Out Periods, it is intended that (i) the current Company
leadership shall continue to supervise the day-to-day management of the
Company (it being understood that such intention does not create a contractual
obligation), and (ii) with respect to the three areas of (1) Customer
Success, (2) Sales and Marketing, and (3) Product and Engineering (each, an "
_Operating Area_ "), the Companys budget will be prepared and the Company
will be operated in a manner consistent with a goal of achieving an Operating
Area Expense Ratio in each Operating Area equal to the Operating Area Expense
Ratio Target for such Operating Area in each Earn-Out Period Quarter. In the
event that, in any Earn-Out Period Quarter, the Operating Area Expense Ratio
for any Operating Area exceeds the Operating Area Expense Ratio Cap for such
Operating Area, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
reduce the Total Company Expenses in such Operating Area during
the immediately following Earn-Out Period Quarter to ensure that, in such
following Earn-Out Period Quarter, the Operating Area Expense Ratio in such
Operating Area does not exceed the Operating Area Expense Ratio Cap for such
Operating Area. In the event the Operating Area Expense Ratio in the same
Operating Area nonetheless exceeds the Operating Area Expense Ratio Cap for
such Operating Area in such following Earn-Out Period Quarter, then the amount
of Total Company Expenses in such Operating Area during such following Earn-
Out Period Quarter in excess of the amount of Total Company Expenses in such
Operating Area that would have resulted in the Operating Area

 



32 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Expense Ratio for such Operating Area being equal to the Operating Area
Expense Ratio Cap shall be an " _Operating Area Excess Expense Amount_ ,"
which shall be taken into account in the calculation of any Adjusted Earn-Out
Amount that may be payable with respect to such following Earn-Out Period
Quarter, in accordance with Section 2.12(a). During the Earn-Out Periods, the
Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly, take any actions for the purpose
of avoiding or reducing the Earn-Out Payment hereunder, or which could
reasonably be expected to have such impact.

 

(f) _Acceleration of Earn-Out Payments_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in the event a Purchaser Change in Control occurs
during either of the Earn-Out Periods, then any amounts contemplated to be
payable pursuant to Section 2.12(a) shall automatically, and without regard to
Revenue or Revenue Targets, Excess Spend Penalties or Operating Area
Excess Expense Amounts, accelerate and be payable in full (to the extent not
previously paid or finally determined not to be payable in accordance with
Section 2.12(b)). For the avoidance of doubt, as a result of such
acceleration, the Purchaser shall pay to the Company Equityholders, at such
time as specified below and in the manner specified in Section 2.13, the
following amount: (a) if the Purchaser Change in Control occurs prior to the
Earn-Out Determination Date with respect to the 2018 Earn-Out Period, an
aggregate amount equal to $20,000,000, and (b) if the Purchaser Change in
Control occurs on or after the Earn-Out Determination Date with respect to the
2018 Earn-Out Period and prior to the end of the 2019 Earn-Out Period, an
aggregate amount equal to (i) the 2018 Earn-Out Payment, if any, if not
previously paid in accordance with this Section 2.12, plus (ii) $15,000,000
(the amount payable pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above, the " _Acceleration
Amount_ "), in each case subject to a deduction for any applicable Earn-Out
Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.12(c). Any Acceleration Amount
(less any applicable Earn-Out Transaction Expenses deducted pursuant to
Section 2.12(c)) that the Purchaser is required to pay pursuant to this
Section 2.12(f) shall be paid to the Company Equityholders, in the manner
specified in Section 2.13, upon the closing of the applicable Purchaser
Change in Control, and following the payment thereof, the Purchaser shall not
be obligated to pay any further amounts under this Section 2.12.

 

(g) _Right of Set-Off_. The Purchaser shall have the right to withhold and set
off against any amount otherwise due to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.12
any amount definitively determined to be owed to the Purchaser or the
Equityholder Representative by the Company Equityholders pursuant to Section
7, Section 9 or Section 11 of this Agreement prior to the date such amount
otherwise due to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.12 becomes due.

(h) _No Security_. The parties hereto understand and agree that (i) the
contingent rights of the Company Equityholders to receive any amounts under
this Section 2.12 shall not be represented by any form of certificate or other
instrument, are not transferable, except by operation of Applicable Laws
relating to descent and distribution, divorce and community property, and do
not constitute an equity or ownership interest in the Purchaser or the
Company, (ii) the Company Equityholders shall not have any rights as a
stockholder of the Purchaser or the Company solely as a result of the
contingent right to receive any amounts under this Section 2.12, and (iii) no
interest is payable with respect to any amounts payable under this Section
2.12.

(i) _Tax Reporting._ Within forty-five (45) days of the payment of any Earn-
Out Payment or Acceleration Amount pursuant to this Section 2.12, the
Purchaser shall provide the Equityholder Representative with an accounting of
the payment, for Tax purposes, setting forth the amount of the payment that
constitutes interest and the amount of the payment that constitutes
principal, computed in accordance with the principles of Section 483 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, which shall be Final
and Binding on the Purchaser, the Payments Administrator, the Equityholder
Representative and the Company Equityholders. Each of the Purchaser and the
Company Equityholders shall (i) timely file all forms and Tax Returns required
to be filed in connection with such accounting, (ii) be bound by such
filings, (iii) prepare and file, and cause their respective Affiliates to
prepare and file, their Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such
accounting, and (iv) not take any position, or cause their
respective Affiliates to take any position, inconsistent with such accounting
on any Tax Return, in any audit or proceeding before any Governmental
Authority or in any report made for Tax purposes. The Equityholder
Representative shall (x) be bound by such filings, and (y) not take any
position, or cause its Affiliates to take any position, inconsistent with such
accounting on any Tax Return, in any audit or proceeding before any
Governmental Authority or in any report made for Tax
purposes. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.12(i) to the contrary,
the parties shall be permitted to take a position inconsistent with that set
forth in this Section 2.12(i) if required to do so by a final and unappealable
decision, judgment, decree or other order by any court of competent
jurisdiction or Governmental Authority.

2.13 Additional Consideration Payments.

(a) In the event that the Purchaser becomes obligated to pay any Additional
Consideration to the Company Equityholders pursuant to Section 2.11, Section
2.12, Section 7 or Section 9, the Purchaser (i) shall deliver the applicable
Additional Consideration (less the portion thereof that is payable through
the Purchasers or the Surviving Corporations payroll processing service or
system pursuant to Section 2.13(b)) to the Payments Administrator (for further
distribution to the Company Equityholders) within the time period or at the
time specified for the payment of such Additional Consideration to the
Company Equityholders pursuant to Section 2.11, Section 2.12, Section 7 or
Section 9 (to the extent any such time is specified), and (ii) shall
thereafter instruct the Payments Administrator to promptly (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days) distribute any such Additional Consideration
to the Company Equityholders entitled thereto, based on the Additional Per
Share Consideration each such Company Equityholder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.6(a), Section 2.8 or Section 2.9.

(b) With respect to any portion of any Additional Consideration that becomes
payable to Company Vested Optionholders the Purchaser shall, in lieu of
delivering such portion of the Additional Consideration to the Payments

contrary in this Agreement, none of the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Payments Administrator, the Escrow Agent or the Equityholder
Representative, or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives,

and, if reasonably required by the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, the
delivery of an indemnification agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Payments Administrator shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Closing
Per Share Consideration for each share of Common Stock represented by such
Certificate. No Company Stockholder shall be required to post any bond in
respect of any lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. 

2.19 Wire Transfers. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
any payment of cash required by this Agreement shall be paid to the recipient

stock options by a Company Stockholder within two years of the date of grant
or within one year of the date of exercise of such incentive stock options)
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to
the appropriate Tax Authority to the extent required by Applicable Law, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the relevant Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

in this Agreement, no fractions of a cent will be payable under this
Agreement, the Payments Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, any Person who

The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing
as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, use, lease or operation of its properties or assets
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be

officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company pursuant to the
Company Stock Incentive Plan, of which (A) 8,633,468 are subject to
unexercised Company Stock Options (whether vested or unvested), and (B)
1,075,602 remain available for issuance to officers, directors, employees and
consultants pursuant to the Company Stock Incentive Plan. As of the Agreement
Date, the Company has outstanding warrants to purchase 596,941 shares of
Series B-1 Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 99,592 shares of Series C

thereunder would be convertible into 99,592 shares of Common Stock.

 

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company

debt or other voting securities or equity interests of the Company
outstanding, authorized, issued or reserved for issuance, (ii) no securities,
instruments or obligations of the Company that are or may become convertible

 outstanding or authorized, in each case, except as set forth in Section
4.3(a). There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom
stock, profit participation, or similar rights with respect to the Company.
Except for the Stockholders Agreements, (i) the Company is not a party to any
voting agreement with respect to shares of the capital stock of, voting debt
or other voting securities or equity interests of the Company, or to any
agreement restricting or relating to the transfer of, requiring registration
of, relating to dividends or other distributions with respect to, or granting
any preemptive rights, antidilutive rights, rights of first refusal, purchase
option or similar rights with respect to any shares of the capital stock of,

no voting agreements or voting trusts with respect to any shares of the

its terms to be effective (the " _Grant Date_ ") by all necessary corporate
action, and (ii) was made in all material respects in accordance with the
terms of the Company Stock Incentive Plan and all other Applicable Law. Each
grant of a Company Stock Option that was intended to qualify as an "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies. The per share
exercise price of each Company Stock Option was not less than the fair market
value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date.

(c)  _Section 4.3(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
correct and complete list, as of the Agreement Date, of (i) all holders of
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, including the number and type of

unexercised Company Stock Options, including with respect to each outstanding
Company Stock Option held by any such holder, the number of shares of Common
Stock subject thereto, the exercise price, expiration date and vesting

vesting thereof will be accelerated in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and an indication of
whether such Company Stock Option is an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code, and (iii) all holders of Company Warrants, including with
respect to each outstanding Company Warrant held by any such holder, the
number and type of shares of Company Capital Stock for which it is exercisable

than eighty-five percent (85%) of the outstanding shares of Series C
Preferred Stock have adopted resolutions in an action by written consent
specifying that, upon the Closing, and effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective conversion
rate (such resolutions, the " _Mandatory Conversion Approval_ "), in
accordance with Section 5 of Part B of Article FOURTH of the Companys
certificate of incorporation. As a result, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and after giving effect to the mandatory conversion of all
Preferred Stock in accordance with the Mandatory Conversion Approval, there
will be no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding.

of time or both), any material Contract to which the Company may be bound or

order, judgment, injunction, award or decree of any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority, or any agreement with, or condition imposed by, any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority binding upon the Company, (d) result in a

(provided that one or the other be done). The parties shall cooperate with
each other to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be afforded to designated portions of the

reasonably acceptable to the other party) legally required to disclose
Confidential Information under Applicable Law, the disclosing party may do so
without liability to the other party, except that disclosure of Confidential
Information shall be limited to the information actually required to be
disclosed pursuant to Applicable Law; or

brought by a party hereto in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its
remedies hereunder.

concerning the other party or any of its Affiliates furnished to it by the
other party or such other partys Representatives in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except that
Confidential Information shall not include documents or information that can
be shown to have (i) been already in the possession of the party, _provided_
that such information is not known by such party to be subject to another
confidentiality agreement with or other obligation of secrecy to the other
party or another party; or (ii) become generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure by the party or become available to the
party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the other party or
its Representatives, _provided_ that such source is not known, after due
inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other obligation
of secrecy to the other party or another party;

(c) _provided, however_ , that following the Closing the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.7 will not apply to the Purchasers use of
documents and information concerning the Company furnished by the Company
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated and this Agreement is

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent that such

parachute payments is obtained pursuant to this Section 5.12(b), would not
be deductible by the Company under Section 280G (which such determination
shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and approval by
the Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (the "
_Section 280G Waiver_ "). As soon as practicable following the delivery by
the Company to Purchaser of the Section 280G Waiver, the Company shall submit
to each holder of Company Capital Stock for approval (in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser), by such number of Company Stockholders as is

that were subject to the vote of Company Stockholders (the " _Section 280G
Stockholder Approval_ "), or (ii) the Section 280G Stockholder Approval was
not obtained and as a consequence, no Section 280G Payments shall be made or

preceding sentence, the Company shall cause the Disclosure Materials to be
distributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within ten (10) days, after the Agreement Date,
provided that it has received and delivered to Purchaser the Section 280G

inconsistent with that set forth in this Section 5.13 if required to do so by

member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign law; (D) Taxes of any Person (other than

successor, by Contract or otherwise, pursuant to a transaction or Contract or
other indemnification obligation that occurs or arises before the Closing; (E)
the inaccuracy or breach of any representations or warranties contained in

resulting from any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made
in this Agreement; (G) transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other similar Taxes incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) (" _Transfer

Equityholder Indemnified Parties against, and pay or reimburse any Company
Equityholder Indemnified Party for, all Losses that such Company Equityholder
Indemnified Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a

Company or for which the Company may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year
or period that begins after the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle

(as determined pursuant to Section 7.1(c)). Any amounts owed to the Company
Equityholders by the Purchaser under this Section 7.1(b) shall be paid by the
Purchaser in the manner specified in Section 2.13.

(c) To the extent permitted or required by Applicable Law, the taxable year of
the Company that includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on

is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company for a
Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, and
the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, shall be
determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable
years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the

Taxes based on or measured by income, sales, use, receipts or other similar
items of the

calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for amortization or
depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods
on a daily basis in proportion to the number of days in each period (not
withstanding that such exemptions, allowances or deductions may under
Applicable Law be determined solely at the end of the Tax period). All other
Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period shall be allocated or apportioned
between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis, such that such
Taxes for a Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be deemed to be equal to the
amount of all such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of
such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding taxable period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period,
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period.

Equityholders shall not be liable for any Taxes resulting solely from the
deemed asset sale pursuant to such election, and the Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company Equityholder Indemnified
Parties from any such Taxes resulting solely from such election.

(e) Any and all Tax-sharing, allocation and indemnification agreements and
similar arrangements (whether or not written) that may have been entered into
by or with respect to the Company (excluding any such agreement or arrangement
entered into in the ordinary course of business the primary purpose of
which does not relate to Taxes) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date
and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not have any further rights or
obligations thereunder.

 

(f) As between the Company and the Purchaser, the Company shall be entitled to
any and all deductions available under the Code and reported on Tax Returns
of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period resulting from withholdings made
from payments of the Closing Consideration to Company Equityholders who are
employees or former employees of the Company in accordance with Section
2.13(b).

extensions properly obtained), in each case by or with respect to the Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_
"). The Company shall timely file or cause to be filed when due all such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns due prior to the Closing Date (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) and shall timely pay or cause to be timely paid
all Taxes due in respect of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns. Subject to Section
7.2(c) and Section 7.2(d), the Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be
timely filed all such Pre-Closing Tax Returns due after the Closing Date
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained).

(b) Subject to Section 7.2(c) and Section 7.2(d), the Purchaser shall prepare
and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by or with respect to the Company after the Closing Date
for any Straddle Period (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained).

 

(c) Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, the Purchaser shall prepare
and timely file any Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes.

 

(d) With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by the Company or the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods or Straddle Periods, (i) such Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner
consistent with past practice and no position shall be taken, election made or
method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or
methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns (including, without
limitation, any position which would have the effect of accelerating or
deferring income or deductions for periods or portions thereof for which the
Company Equityholders, in the case of Tax Returns prepared by the Purchaser,
or the Purchaser, in the case of Tax Returns prepared by the Company, are
liable under Section 7.1) and (ii) such Tax Returns shall be submitted to the
Equityholder Representative, in the case of Tax Returns prepared by the
Purchaser, or the Purchaser, in the case of Tax Returns prepared by the
Company, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
income Tax Returns or ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing such
non-income Tax Returns (in each case taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) for review and approval by the Equityholder Representative
or the Purchaser, as applicable, which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, but may in all cases be withheld if such Tax
Returns were not prepared in accordance with clause (i) of this sentence;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to file any
Tax Return, or take any position thereon, and clause (i) shall therefore not
apply, to the extent that the Purchaser or the Company determines, with the
written advice of independent Tax counsel, that there is not at least
"substantial authority," within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i) of the
Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
law), for a particular position.

 

(e) The Company Equityholders, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall pay the other party for the Taxes for which the Company
Equityholders or the Purchaser, respectively, are liable pursuant to Section
7.1 but which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the other party
or its representative pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section
7.2 promptly upon the written request of the party entitled to payment,
setting forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by the Company
Equityholders or the Purchaser, as the case may be, but in no event earlier
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes. For
the avoidance of doubt, any notice or request for a payment owed to or by the
Company Equityholders under this Section 7.2(e) shall be delivered only by or
to the Equityholder Representative, acting on behalf of the Company
Equityholders in accordance with Section 11.1 (it being understood that, in
the event that payment is required directly from the Company Equityholders
pursuant to clause (v) below, the Equityholder Representative shall not be
responsible for pursuing or collecting any funds from the Company
Equityholders), and any

 



75 ##### Table of Contents

  

 payment owed by the Company Equityholders under this Section 7.2(e) shall be
made (i) first, solely if the payment owed by the Company Equityholders is a
result of a Section 382 Liability, from the Section 382 Escrow Fund, (ii)
thereafter, from the General Escrow Fund, (iii) thereafter, from the proceeds
of the Reps and Warranties Policy (to the extent coverage is available for
such amounts under the Reps and Warranties Policy), (iv) thereafter, as a
set-off against an applicable Earn-Out Payment or Acceleration Amount in
accordance with Section 2.12(g), and (v) finally by the Company Equityholders,
based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages. Any payment owed to the
Company Equityholders by the Purchaser under this Section 7.2(e) shall be paid
by the Purchaser in the manner specified in Section 2.13. For the avoidance of
doubt, (x) any indemnity or other liability payment owed by the Company
Equityholders related to Taxes, whether under this Section 7.2(e) or
otherwise, shall be paid from the General Escrow Fund and not from the Section
382 Escrow Fund, except solely to the extent the payment owed by the Company
Equityholders is a result of a Section 382 Liability, and (y) the amount of
any Section 382 Liability recovered from the Section 382 Escrow Fund may not
also be recovered from the General Escrow Fund ( _i.e._ , no double-
counting).

(f) The Purchaser shall file a consolidated federal income tax return that
includes the Company for the taxable period of the Company starting with the
day next following the Closing Date. Accordingly, the taxable year of the
Company will close for federal income tax purposes at the end of the day on
the Closing Date. No election under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable allocation of elections) shall be
made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company Equityholders shall not be responsible for any Taxes resulting from
transactions undertaken by the Company at the direction of the Purchaser on
the Closing Date but after the Effective Time outside the ordinary course of
business other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Purchaser agrees that it and its Affiliates will not elect to treat the
Closing Consideration as allocable to the day following the Closing Date
pursuant to the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

 

(g) None of the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall (or shall
cause or permit the Company to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant
an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return of
the Company with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Equityholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) if any Company Equityholder or any of its Affiliates could
reasonably be expected to be liable for a material amount of additional Taxes
on such Tax Return under Section 7.1(a) as a result of such amendment,
refiling or modification, unless such amendment, refiling or modification is
required to comply with applicable Law or the final resolution of a Tax
Contest contested in accordance with Section 7.3.

7.3 Contest Provisions.

 

(a) If one party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section
7.1 (whether the Company Equityholders collectively, or the Purchaser, as
applicable, the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ ") and the other party (whether the
Company Equityholders collectively, or the Purchaser, as applicable, the "
_Tax Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of any pending or threatened
federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments which
might

 



76 ##### Table of Contents

  

 affect the Tax liabilities for which the other party may be liable pursuant
to Section 7.1 (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim and shall
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Tax Indemnified
Party) the facts constituting the basis for such Tax Claim, the nature of the
relief sought, and the amount of the claimed Losses. No failure or delay on
the part of the Tax Indemnified Party to give notice to the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the
Tax Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that
the Tax Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby (as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction).

 

(b) The Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Company Equityholders,
shall have the sole right to represent the Companys interests in any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding (a " _Tax Contest_ ") of or with
respect to the Company relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and to employ
counsel of its choice at the expense of the Company Equityholders, so long as
the Equityholder Representative provides written notice to the Purchaser of
its intent to control such Tax Contest within thirty (30) days after receiving
notice of such matter; _provided_ that (i) if the Equityholder Representative
fails to give such notice within such time period, the Purchaser shall have
the sole right to control such Tax Contest and (ii) if the Equityholder
Representative timely notifies the Purchaser of its intent to control such
Tax Contest, the Purchaser shall be entitled to participate fully in the Tax
Contest and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose, the fees and
expenses of which separate counsel shall be borne by the Purchaser. In the
case of a Tax Contest of or with respect to the Company, for a Straddle
Period, the Purchaser shall have the sole right to represent the Company, and
the Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Company Equityholders, shall
be entitled to participate at the expense of the Company Equityholders in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or in part)
to Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and, with the written
consent of the Purchaser in its sole discretion, and at the Company
Equityholders sole expense, the Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the
Company Equityholders, may assume the entire control of such audit or
proceeding.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the case of
any Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period, (i) the
non-controlling party shall, in each case, reasonably cooperate, and cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to reasonably cooperate with the controlling
party in pursuing any Tax Contest, including execution of any powers
of attorney in favor of the controlling party, (ii) the controlling party
shall keep the non-controlling party reasonably informed of all material
developments and events relating to such Tax Contest (including promptly
forwarding copies of any material related correspondence to the non-
controlling party) and shall provide the non-controlling party with an
opportunity to review and comment on any material correspondence before the
controlling party sends such correspondence to any Tax Authority), and (iii)
the controlling party may not settle any such Tax Contest without the prior
written consent of the non-controlling party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement
or compromise could reasonably be expected to increase the Tax liability of
the non-controlling party or any of its Affiliates.

 7.4 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of the Company
Equityholders and the Equityholder Representative, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the

 



77 ##### Table of Contents

  

 other hand, shall (and cause their respective Affiliates to) (i) reasonably
assist the other party or parties in connection with the preparation of any
Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in
accordance with Section 7.2; (ii) reasonably cooperate in preparing for or
conducting any audits of, or disputes with Tax Authorities regarding, any
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company; (iii) make available to the other as
reasonably requested all relevant information, records, and documents, and
employees on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any such materials, relating to Taxes of the Company for the
applicable Tax Return and audit period; (iv) furnish the other with copies of
all relevant correspondence received from any Tax Authority in connection with
any Tax audit or information request with respect to any such relevant
taxable period; (v) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may
be reasonably necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or
otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to,
Transfer Taxes; and (vi) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or
similar authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 7\.
Each party (with respect to the Equityholder Representative, to the extent in
its possession) shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and
all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters of the
Company until the later of (A) the expiration of the statute of limitations
for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents relate or
(B) seven (7) years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax
Returns. Thereafter, the applicable party shall provide written notice to the
other party prior to the disposition by it of any information, records or
documents described in this Section 7.4 and allow such other party to obtain
such information, records and documents within thirty (30) days of such
notice.

 

7.5 Exclusivity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
indemnification with respect to Taxes, and the procedures relating thereto
shall be governed exclusively by this Section 7, and the provisions of Section
9 (other than Sections 9.1, 9.2(b), 9.2(c)(ii), 9.2(d), 9.2(h), 9.4, 9.5, 9.6,
9.8 and 9.9) shall not apply.

8\. SURVIVAL

 

8.1 Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Company and the Purchaser contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or
in any certificate furnished pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Fundamental Representations
and the Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing
indefinitely; _provided_ , _further_ , that the representations and warranties
made in Section 4.18 and the indemnification obligations, representations,
warranties and covenants in Section 7 shall expire and be of no further force
and effect, as to each Tax period to which such representation or covenant
applies, upon the ninetieth (90th) day following the closing of the statute of
limitations with respect to such Tax period (including any extensions thereto
to the extent that such statute of limitations may be tolled); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the remaining representations and warranties in Section 3 and
Section 4 ( _i.e._ , other than those previously referred to in this Section
8.1) shall expire and be of no further force and effect upon the date that is
the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or
are to be performed in whole prior to the Closing Date, shall expire and be of
no further force and effect upon the date that is the eighteen (18)-month
anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the covenants
and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Closing

 



78 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Date (other than the covenants and agreements in Section 7), shall expire
and be of no further force and effect upon the date such covenant or agreement
is fully performed; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 9.2(a)(iv) shall survive until the ninetieth
(90th) day following the closing of the statute of limitations with respect to
any claims that are the subject matter thereof. Upon the termination of the
parties respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the corresponding right to seek indemnification in respect
of any inaccuracy or breach of such representations or warranties, or failure
to comply with such agreements and covenants, pursuant to Section 9.2 shall
terminate, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.3(d). It is the express
intent of the parties that, if an applicable survival period as contemplated
by this Section 8.1 is shorter or longer than the statute of limitations that
would otherwise apply, then, by contract, and to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the applicable statute of limitations shall be reduced
or extended to the survival period contemplated hereby.

_Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and reimburse any Purchaser
Indemnified Party for, all Losses that such Purchaser Indemnified Party may at
any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in
connection with:

Indemnified Party under Section 7 or Section 9.2, each Company Equityholder

Equityholders respective Pro Rata Percentage.

(c) _Limitations on Company Equityholder Indemnification_. Notwithstanding
any other provision to the contrary, with respect to any Purchaser Indemnified
Partys claim for any Losses pursuant to Section 7 or Section 9.2(a), the
indemnification obligations of the Company Equityholders shall be subject to
the following limitations (provided that nothing in this Section 9.2(c) shall
apply to or in any way limit any rights of any Purchaser Indemnified Party
under the Reps and Warranties Policy):

 

(i) Except with respect to Losses relating to the inaccuracy or breach of any
Company Fundamental Representation or Losses arising from fraud by the
Company, (A) the Company Equityholders shall not be required to indemnify,
defend or hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnified Party against, or reimburse
any Purchaser Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(i) until the aggregate amount of all such Losses of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties exceeds Six Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($650,000),
after which the Company Equityholders shall be obligated for all such Losses
of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in excess of Six Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($650,000), and (B) the Company Equityholders cumulative, aggregate
indemnification obligation for Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) shall in
no event exceed One Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,300,000).

Escrow Fund, (ii) thereafter, against the General Escrow Fund, (iii)
thereafter, against the Reps and Warranties Policy (with respect to Losses
indemnifiable under Section 7 and Section 9.2(a)(i) and to the extent coverage

thereafter, as a set-off against an applicable Earn-Out Payment or
Acceleration Amount in accordance with Section 2.12(g), and (v) finally,
against the Company Equityholders (with respect to obligations not subject to
the limitations in Section 9.2(c)(i)) based on their respective Pro
Rata Percentages; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing order of
recourse shall not apply in respect of Losses that are indemnifiable under
Section 9.2(a)(iv), and the Purchaser may, at its option, seek recourse in
respect of such Losses from any of the applicable sources in clauses (ii)
through (v) above in any order (it being understood that the Purchaser may, at
its option, seek recourse directly against the Company Equityholders with
respect to such Losses in accordance with clause (v) above without seeking
any recourse from any other source). For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser
shall have no recourse against the Section 382 Escrow Fund except to the
extent of a Section 382 Liability.

Section 7 and this Section 9, (i) an inaccuracy or breach of a representation
or warranty of the Company shall be deemed to exist either if such
representation or warranty (A) is actually inaccurate or breached or (B) would
have been inaccurate or breached if such representation or warranty had not
contained any limitation or qualification as to "materiality," "Company
Material Adverse Effect" (which instead shall be read as any adverse effect or
change), dollar amounts or similar language set forth in such representation

81 ##### Table of Contents

  

 pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), shall be determined without regard to
any such limitation or qualification as to "materiality," "Company Material
Adverse Effect" (which instead shall be read as any adverse effect or
change), dollar amounts or similar language. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
for purposes of a claim under Section 9.2(a)(v) that relates to an inaccuracy
or breach of a representation or warranty by the Company, subsection (i)(B)
of this Section 9.2(h) shall not apply.

9.3 Notification of Claims.

(a) If a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Company Equityholder Indemnified
Party may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement, the Purchaser,
acting on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or the Equityholder
Representative, acting on behalf of the Company Equityholder Indemnified
Parties (the Purchaser, acting on behalf of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, or the Equityholder Representative, acting on behalf of
the Company Equityholder Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Party_ "),
shall promptly notify the Equityholder Representative, acting on behalf of the
Company Equityholders, or the Purchaser, as applicable (the Equityholder
Representative or the Purchaser, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of
any actual or imminent Loss or pending or threatened claim or demand that
the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against a Purchaser
Indemnified Party or a Company Equityholder Indemnified Party, such claim
being a " _Third Party Claim_ ") prior to the expiration of the
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation forming the basis of such
Loss or claim or demand, describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such Loss or claim or
demand to the extent then known to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release any
Company Equityholder or the Purchaser from any of its indemnification
obligations under this Section 9 except to the extent such Company
Equityholder or the Purchaser, as applicable, is actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure, and then such Company Equityholder or the
Purchaser, as applicable, shall only be released from such indemnification
obligations to the extent it was actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure. For the avoidance of doubt, the Equityholder Representative acting
on behalf of the Company Equityholders as the Indemnifying Party does not have
indemnification or payment obligations itself under Section 9.2 or any other
provision of this Agreement or the agreements ancillary hereto.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 9.3(a), the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim, at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense, but shall allow the Indemnified Party a
reasonable opportunity to participate (but not control) in the defense of
such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense and shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in connection with such
participation; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled
to assume control of such defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Indemnified Party) if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party (or the Persons
on whose behalf the Indemnified Party is acting in accordance with Section
9.3(a)), (iii) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a

 



82 ##### Table of Contents

  

 conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying
Party (or the Persons on whose behalf the Indemnified Party is acting in
accordance with Section 9.3(a)), or (iv) the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes that the Losses relating to the Third Party Claim could exceed the
maximum amount that such Indemnified Party (or the Persons on whose behalf the
Indemnified Party is acting in accordance with Section 9.3(a)) could then be
entitled to recover under the applicable provisions of this Section 9\.
Subject to the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
from its receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim from an Indemnified Party
to notify the Indemnified Party of whether the Indemnifying Party desires to
so assume and control the defense of the Third Party Claim, and if the
Indemnifying Party undertakes to assume and control the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel, contractors and
consultants of recognized standing and competence, after consultation with the
Indemnified Party, and, subject to the restrictions on the settlement of such
claim below, shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall, and shall
cause each of its Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, in the defense of
any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party
Claim unless (x) such settlement is on exclusively monetary terms, does not
exceed the indemnification caps in Section 9.2 and provides a complete
release of, or dismissal with prejudice of, all claims against any Indemnified
Party (or the Persons on whose behalf the Indemnified Party is acting in
accordance with Section 9.3(a)) potentially affected by such Third
Party Claim for all matters that were or could have been asserted in
connection with such claim, or (y) the Indemnified Party shall have consented
in writing to the terms of such settlement, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party
does not undertake within the thirty (30)-day period referenced above to
assume and control the defense of a Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying
Party is not entitled to assume control of the defense due to the
circumstances described in clauses (i) through (iv) above, then (1) the
Indemnified Party may defend against and settle any such Third Party Claim in
such manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate, (2) the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense of such
Third Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, and the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
connection with such participation, and (3) the Indemnified Party shall not
settle any Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party shall have
consented in writing to the terms of the settlement, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) In the event an Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.3(a) that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within forty-five (45) days following its receipt of such
notice if the Indemnifying Party disputes the liability of the Company
Equityholders or the Purchaser, as applicable, set forth in the claim under
this Section 9\. If the Indemnifying Party does not so notify the Indemnified

(c) in the case of disputes subject to resolution pursuant to Section 2.11, as
to which the provisions of Section 2.11 shall govern, (d) in the case of

exclusive remedies of the Company Equityholders and the Purchaser,
respectively, for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations or
warranties in this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements and for any
failure to perform or comply with any covenants or agreements in this

nothing set forth in this Section 9 shall be deemed to prohibit or limit any

equitable relief for the failure of any other party to perform any covenant
or agreement contained herein.

 which have been recovered by the Person entitled to indemnification in

(excluding proceeds under the Reps and Warranties Policy), which proceeds
shall be determined net of any deductible payable with respect to the
applicable insurance policy and any costs of collection.

third Person any amount in respect of a matter for which such Person has
previously recovered from the Purchaser or the Company Equityholders pursuant
to this Section 9, such Person shall promptly pay over to the Purchaser or the
Company Equityholders, as applicable, the amount so recovered

such recovery), but not in excess of the amount previously recovered from the
Purchaser or the Company Equityholders, as applicable, in respect of such
matter.

Indemnified Party may make a claim for the same Loss or related Losses under
Section 7 or this Section 9, on the one hand, and the Reps and Warranties
Policy, on the other hand (in its sole discretion); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event will a Purchaser Indemnified Party be entitled to recover
amounts under Section 7 or this Section 9 that, when aggregated together with
the amounts recovered under the Reps and Warranties Policy, exceed its Losses
with respect to such claim. The denial of any claim under the Reps and
Warranties Policy shall not be construed as, or used as evidence that, a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under Section 7
or this Section 9.

from the Escrow Funds or otherwise;

(vi) to retain auditors, attorneys, arbitrators, accountants and any other
Persons as the Equityholder Representative shall deem necessary in connection
with the performance of its duties hereunder;

 

(vii) to take such further actions as are authorized in this Agreement or the

instructions and other documents contemplated by or deemed by the Equityholder
Representative to be necessary or desirable in connection with this Agreement,
the Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated herein or
therein.

(c) _Reliance on Authority_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on such
appointment and to treat the Equityholder Representative as the duly appointed
attorney-in-fact of each Company Equityholder. The Company Equityholders shall
cooperate with the Equityholder Representative and any accountants, attorneys
or other agents whom it may retain to assist in carrying out its duties
hereunder. Each Company Equityholder, by execution of the Company Stockholder
Consent and Joinder, and without any further action, confirms
such appointment and authority. After the Closing, notices given to the
Equityholder Representative in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement shall constitute notice to the Company Equityholders for all
purposes under this Agreement.

 

(d) _Extent and Survival of Authority_. The appointment of the Equityholder
Representative is an agency coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and
any action taken by the Equityholder Representative pursuant to the authority
granted in this Section 11.1 shall be effective and absolutely binding on each

perform only such duties as are set forth in this Agreement and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the

authority and agency of the Equityholder Representative. The Purchaser, the
Company, their respective Affiliates, and each of its and their Affiliates
respective Representatives shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall have no
liability of any kind to, the Company Equityholders with respect to any such

Representative are fully authorized by all of the Company Equityholders.

 



91 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) _Exculpation; Indemnification_. The Equityholder Representative will incur
no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Equityholder Representative in connection with its services pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except to the extent of
liability resulting from the Equityholder Representatives gross negligence,
willful misconduct, fraud or bad faith. The Company Equityholders shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Equityholder Representative from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_
") arising out of or in connection with the Equityholder Representatives
execution and performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; 
_provided_ , that to the extent that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct,
fraud or bad faith of the Equityholder Representative, the Equityholder
Representative will reimburse the Company Equityholders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or bad faith. If not paid directly to
the Equityholder Representative by the Company Equityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Equityholder Representative,
subject to the terms set forth in the Equityholder Representative Engagement
Letter, from (i) the funds in the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund,
(ii) the amounts in the General Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Company Equityholders pursuant to
Section 9.4(a) and Section 9.4(c), and (iii) from any Earn-Out Payments
pursuant to Section 2.12; _provided_ , that while this section allows the
Equityholder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the Company Equityholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Equityholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Equityholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the Company Equityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnification obligations of the Company Equityholders set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities
provided to the Equityholder Representative under this section. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the
Equityholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(f) _Expense Fund_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to the Equityholder Representative the Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount, which amount shall be used by the Equityholder
Representative for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing
the Equityholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to
this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Company Equityholders
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Equityholder Representative
Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Equityholder
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Equityholder Representative will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or
bad faith. The Equityholder Representative will hold these funds separate from
its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or
any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the

 completion of the Equityholder Representatives responsibilities, any
remaining balance of the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund shall be
released by the Equityholder Representative for payment to the Company
Equityholders, in accordance with Section 11.1(g). For tax purposes, the
Equityholder Representative Expense Fund will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Equityholders at the time
of Closing.

(g) _Release of Equityholder Representative Expense Fund_. The Equityholder
Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser all amounts released from the
Equityholder Representative Expense Fund that constitute Additional
Consideration payable to Company Vested Optionholders, and the Purchaser shall
cause such Additional Consideration to be paid to the Company Vested
Optionholders through the Purchasers or the Surviving Corporations payroll
processing service or system on the first reasonably practicable payroll date
following receipt of such amounts from the Equityholder
Representative, subject to applicable Tax withholding and reporting
requirements. The Equityholder Representative shall deliver to the Payments
Administrator, and the Purchaser shall instruct the Payments Administrator to
promptly distribute, all other amounts released from the Equityholder
Representative Expense Fund to the Company Equityholders entitled to such
Additional Consideration, based on the Additional Per Share Consideration each
such Company Equityholder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(a),
Section 2.8 or Section 2.9.

and the attachments to them, and the other agreements, documents and
certificates contemplated hereby or delivered pursuant hereto, contain the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof

oral or written, by and among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, except that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
to bind the parties thereto in the event this Agreement is terminated.

cancelled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a
written instrument signed by each of the parties or, in the case of a waiver,
by the party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any right, power or
privilege, or any single or partial exercise of any such right, power
or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other such right, power or privilege.

 11.4 Publicity.

(a) Except as may otherwise be required by Applicable Law, no press release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be made without the prior written approval of (i)
the Purchaser and (ii) the Company (if at or prior to Closing) or the
Equityholder Representative (if after the Closing), which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The parties hereto shall cooperate with
each other in making any such press release or public announcement, _provided_
, _however_ , that the parties shall not be required to consult or cooperate
with each other, and no consent shall be required with respect to any press
release or public announcement issued in connection with a dispute between the

11.7 Venue and Jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or
if such court lacks jurisdiction, any other state or federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware), with respect to any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or connected with this Agreement.

11.8 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

 

11.9 Captions. The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. All references herein to
articles, sections, Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed references to such
parts of this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Sections
without decimals (such as "Section 2") shall include all sections numbered
with decimals in such Section ( _e.g_., Section 2.1, Section  2.2).

 herein. Whenever the singular is used herein, the same shall include the
plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the same shall include the
singular, where appropriate. The words "include," "includes" and "including,"
and derivative or similar words, shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The word "or" shall include both the conjunctive
and disjunctive. The phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
References to dollars or "$" are references to United States of America
dollars. All references to shares of Common Stock outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time include all shares of Common Stock
issued upon the conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with the Mandatory Conversion Approval
and Section 5 of Part B of Article FOURTH of the Companys certificate of
incorporation.

 

(b) No uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed or resolved against
any party under any rule of construction or any legal decision providing that
ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the
party that drafted it. No party to this Agreement shall be considered the
draftsman. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated and accepted by all parties and their attorneys and
shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the
words used so as to fairly accomplish the purposes and intentions of all
parties hereto.

 

11.11 Dollar References. All dollar references in this Agreement are to the
currency of the United States.

11.12 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

11.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Each counterpart
may consist of a number of copies hereof each signed by less than all, but
together signed by all, of the parties hereto.

11.14 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or
shall be construed to give any Person, other than the parties hereto, their
successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.
