Subject to clause 4.2, between the Execution Date and the earlier of
Completion and any valid termination of this agreement, the Seller must use
reasonable endeavours to ensure that the business of the Target Entities is
conducted materially in the ordinary course consistent with its usual
business practices and does not make any significant change to the nature or

     | (a) | the Seller or any Target Entity from doing any of the
following permitted actions: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Transaction Agreements: actions that are expressly
contemplated in this agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or the
Disclosure Materials; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | emergencies: actions to reasonably and prudently respond to
an emergency or disaster giving rise to a risk of personal injury to the

     | (a) | Before Completion, the Seller must: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | identify all existing loans between a Seller Group Member
and a Target Entity, including a good faith estimate of the amount of the
Premium Funding Balance as at or immediately before Completion ( _Estimated
Premium Funding Completion Balance_ ), such estimate of the Premium Funding
Balance to be notified to the Buyer no less than 10 Business Days before
Completion; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | procure that all payments are made and such other actions
are taken as may be necessary to ensure: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the payment in full, forgiveness or elimination of loan

---|---|--- 



     | (B) | no Target Entity has any outstanding Financial Debt as at
Completion, 
---|---|--- 

on or prior to Completion.



     | (b) | Nothing in clause 4.3(a) requires the Seller to pay in full
or eliminate any trading debts which exist between a Seller Group Member and a
Target Entity and were incurred in the ordinary course of business. Following
Completion, the Buyer must procure any Target Entity to pay any trading debt
which exists between a Seller Group and that Target Entity and incurred in the
ordinary course of business in full and without any set off, such payment to
be made in accordance with the normal terms of trade that applied as between

---|---|--- 
 



page 19 ---|---|--- 
  Share Sale Agreement |  | 



      | (c) | On Completion, the Buyer will procure (and provide
necessary funding to enable) the relevant Target Entities to repay to the
Seller Group in full and without any withholding or set off, the Estimated
Premium Funding Completion Balance. If the Completion Accounts specify a
Premium Funding Balance as at Completion which is different from the Estimated
Premium Funding Completion Balance, then: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | if the amount of the Premium Funding Balance in the
Completion Accounts is more than the Estimated Premium Funding Completion
Balance, the Buyer will procure the relevant Target Entity(ies) to pay the
amount of the difference to the Seller Group in full and without any
withholding or set off within 5 Business Days of preparation of the Completion
Accounts; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if the amount of the Premium Funding Balance in the
Completion Accounts is less than the Estimated Premium Funding Completion
Balance, the Seller will repay to the Buyer the amount of the difference in
full and without any withholding or set off within 5 Business Days of
preparation of the Completion Accounts. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Schedule 21 is a worked example of the operation of this
clause 4.3 based on balances as at 28 February 2014 and is included as a guide
for the interpretation of this clause 4.3, including the identification of
Premium Funding Balance amounts. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | No less than 5 Business Days prior to Completion, the Buyer
and the Seller must, acting reasonably, agree a good faith estimate of the
Deferred Consideration Liability as at Completion. On Completion, the Seller
must ensure that an amount equal to that good faith estimate is held in a
separately designated bank account in the name of one or more members of the
Target Group. The parties agree that the Deferred Consideration Liability will
not be the subject of the adjustment contained in clause 6. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties agree that the Completion Accounts will not include any
adjustment in respect of any Deferred Consideration Liability.

Buyer Group Member or a Target Entity is, or would be but for this clause 8.8,
entitled to recover, or be compensated for by any other means, from
another source whether by way of contract or otherwise (including under a
policy of insurance or from a Governmental Agency). In this clause 8.8

entitlement that would have existed but for any change in the terms of
insurance since immediately before Completion. The Buyer and the Buyers
Guarantor must notify its insurers of this clause 8.8.

      | (b) | This clause 8.9 does not prevent the Buyer Group Member or
Target Entity entitled to make a claim under a Transaction Agreement (other
than this agreement) from commencing that claim. However, if for any
reason more than one amount is paid in respect of the same Loss, the Buyer
must procure that the additional amount is immediately repaid to one or more

   14.5 | Acknowledgments 
---|--- 

The Seller acknowledges that:

 



     | (a) | all the prohibitions and restrictions contained in this
clause 14 are reasonable in the circumstances and necessary to protect the
goodwill of the Business as at the Completion Date; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | damages alone would not be adequate to compensate the Buyer
for any breach by the Seller of this clause 14 and agrees that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | without limiting the relief that the Buyer is entitled to
seek, the Buyer may seek an injunction if the Seller is in breach or threatens
to breach, or if the Buyer reasonably believes that the Seller will breach
the provisions of this clause 14; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Seller will not make any submission or contention in
any proceeding at which the Buyer seeks an injunction in relation to any
breach, or any alleged, threatened or apprehended breach, of this clause 14 to
the effect that granting an injunction is not appropriate because the payment
of damages alone would be adequate to compensate the Buyer. 
---|---|--- 



   14.6 | Public holding and Retained Business 
---|--- 

Nothing in this clause 14 in any way restricts a Seller Group Member from:



     | (a) | holding 5% or less of the voting shares of a company whose
shares are listed on a stock exchange; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | directly or indirectly engaging in or being involved in the
Retained Business. 
---|---|--- 



   14.7 | Acquisitions 
---|--- 

With the exception of clause 14.2 which applies in relation to any relevant
company or acquired business referred to in this clause 14.7, nothing in this
clause 14 prohibits a Seller Group Member from acquiring a controlling
interest in:



     | (a) | any other company (in this clause 14.7, a _relevant company_
) being a company that is itself or that has a subsidiary that is directly or
indirectly engaged in, conducts or is concerned or interested in a Protected
Business, so long as the Seller Group Member did not have any interest in the
relevant company as at the Execution Date, provided that the Protected
Business comprises less than 10% of either the earnings before interest and
tax or revenues of the relevant company as set out in the most recent full
fiscal year financial statements of the relevant company at the time of
acquisition; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

any business (in this clause 14.7 an _acquired business_ ) that involves a
Protected Business, so long as the Seller Group Member did not have any
interest in the acquired business as at the Execution Date and the Protected
Business comprises less than 10% of either the earnings before interest and
tax or revenues of the acquired business as set out in the most recent full
fiscal year financial statements of the acquired business at the time of
acquisition, 

---|---|--- 
 



page 45 ---|---|--- 
  Share Sale Agreement |  | 



      |  nor prohibits any Seller Group Member from continuing to carry
on the business of the relevant company or the acquired business provided that
the Seller must procure that the relevant Seller Group Member does not take
active steps to materially increase the nature or scale of the Protected
Business that existed at the time that it acquired the relevant company or
acquired business, as the case may be. 
---|--- 
 



   14.8 | Change of control  Seller 
---|--- 

If:

 



     | (a) | a company that is not a Seller Group Member as at the
Completion Date (in this clause 14.8 an _acquirer_ ) acquires a controlling
interest in the Seller following the Completion Date; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the acquirer, or any Related Body Corporate of the acquirer
that was not a Seller Group Member as at the Completion Date ( _acquirer group
member_ ), is engaged in, conducts or is concerned or interested in any
business or activity that competes with the Business as carried on at
Completion ( _acquirer s business_), 
---|---|--- 
 

then nothing in this clause 14 prohibits the acquirer from acquiring the
controlling interest in the Seller nor prohibits the acquirer or any acquirer
group member from continuing to carry on the acquirers business or any other
activity.



   15 | Employees 
---|--- 



   15.1 | Existing employees 
---|--- 

The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it will procure that those Target
Entities which employ Existing Employees will, on and from Completion, comply
in comparable respects with the terms of the existing contracts of employment
pursuant to which the Existing Employees are employed at the time immediately
before Completion. However, to the extent that any terms of the existing
contracts are conditional upon the Target Entity being a member of the Seller
Group, the Buyer will make available alternative or different terms, provided
that the terms, considered on an overall basis, remain no less favourable
than the terms of the existing contracts of employment.



   15.2 | Offer of employment to Seller Group Employees 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Seller must use reasonable endeavours to procure that
each employee employed by a Seller Group Member in connection with the
Business listed in Schedule 19 becomes employed by a Target Group Entity
before Completion pursuant to offers of employment consistent with clauses
15.2(b)(i) to 15.2(b)(iii) (inclusive). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If the Seller Group Employees have not already become
employed by a Target Entity before Completion, the Seller and the Buyer must
work cooperatively to ensure that offers of employment are made to the Seller
Group Employees by a Target Entity: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | for a position that is substantially similar to or superior
to the existing position of the Seller Group Employee commencing on
Completion; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | on terms and conditions of employment (including
superannuation and incentives) that are substantially similar to, and,
considered on an overall basis, no less favourable than the existing terms and
conditions of employment of the Seller Group Employee overall; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | that states, and ensures that any contract arising from
acceptance of the offer provides, that: 
---|---|--- 
 



page 46 ---|---|--- 
  Share Sale Agreement |  | 



      | (A) | the offer is conditional on Completion and on the
resignation of the Seller Group Employee from his or her existing position; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | employment commences on Completion; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | the prior service of the Seller Group Employee with any
Target Entity or Seller Group Member will be recognised for the purposes of
all service related entitlements, including the Leave Benefits to be paid or
provided and any redundancy payment that may be made after Completion, 
---|---|--- 

and the Seller and the Buyer must each use reasonable endeavours to encourage
the Seller Group Employees to accept the offers of employment referred to in
this clause 15.2.



     | (c) | The Seller agrees to pay to, or in respect of, each Seller
Group Employee who accepts employment with a Target Entity in accordance with
clause 15.2: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | all amounts to which that employee is entitled including
wages, salary, allowances, superannuation contributions and commissions
accrued or arising at Completion (whether arising by law or under any
agreement or instrument) in relation to their employment before Completion;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | to the extent it has not already done so, all bonus
payments which have fallen due for payment before the Completion Date, 
---|---|--- 
 

but nothing in this clause places any obligation on the Seller to make, or to
procure the making of, any payment of the Employee Entitlements. 



   15.3 | Payment and indemnity 
---|--- 

The Buyer and the Buyers Guarantor must:

 



     | (a) | provide, or procure that a Target Entity provides, the
relevant Seller Group Employees who accept employment with a Target Entity in
accordance with clause 15.2 with all Leave Benefits due to them after the
Completion Date as and when they fall due; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | indemnify each Seller Group Member against any Loss suffered
or incurred by it: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | for Leave Benefits due to or accrued by a Seller Group
Employee after the Completion Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Leave Benefits attributable to service by the Seller Group Employee with the
relevant Seller Group Member and any predecessor of the relevant Seller Group
Member up to the Completion Date); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | arising from any claim by a Seller Group Employee who
accepts employment with a Target Entity in accordance with clause 15.2 that is
based on any event occurring on or after Completion. 
---|---|--- 
 



   16 | Superannuation 
---|--- 



   16.1 | Buyers Fund 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to any choice of fund election made by an Existing
Member in accordance with relevant law, within one month (or any longer period
agreed between the Buyer and the Seller) after Completion, the Buyer must
ensure that the Buyers Fund replaces the Sellers Fund as the default
superannuation fund pursuant to the SGA in respect of the Existing Members,
with effect on and from Completion. 
---|---|--- 
 



page 47 ---|---|--- 
  Share Sale Agreement |  | 



      | (b) | For the purposes of clause 16.1(a), membership of the
Buyers Fund for each Existing Member (in respect of the period after
Completion) must be on terms and conditions so as to provide benefits which,
in aggregate, are no less favourable than those provided in respect of the
Existing Member under the governing rules of the Sellers Fund in force
immediately before Completion. 
---|---|--- 
 



   16.2 | Continued membership of Chosen Fund 
---|--- 

In respect of each Existing Employee or Seller Group Employee who is,
immediately before Completion, a member of a Chosen Fund and who is not an
Existing Member, the Buyer must ensure that the arrangements in effect
immediately before Completion to facilitate the selection of the Chosen
Fund will continue unchanged following Completion until the Existing Employee
or Seller Group Employee (as applicable) decides to change those arrangements.



   16.3 | Buyers undertakings 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Buyer must provide, and must use all reasonable
endeavours to ensure that the trustee of the Buyers Fund provides, to the
Seller and the trustee of the Sellers Fund any information reasonably
required by them in connection with this clause 16\. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Buyer must use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that
the governing rules of the Buyers Fund are amended to the extent necessary to
give effect to this clause 16\. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | This clause 16 does not apply in relation to employees of
any Target Entity incorporated in New Zealand. 
---|---|--- 



   17 | Confidentiality and announcements 
---|--- 



   17.1 | Agreed announcement 
---|--- 



     | (a) | A party may not make any other public announcement relating
to a Transaction Agreement (including the fact that the parties have executed
a Transaction Agreement) unless the other party has consented to the
announcement (other than any immaterial changes which do not affect the
substance of the announcement or which correct manifest errors therein),
including the timing, form and content of that disclosure, or unless the
announcement would be permitted under an exemption in clauses 17.2(a)(i) or
17.2(a)(ii). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Nothing in this clause 17 prevents the Buyer from making any
disclosure in respect of any matter required by law, including, the Target
Entities, sending supplementary Product Disclosure Statements,
Financial Services Guides and other disclosure documents to clients and fund
members. 
---|---|--- 



   17.2 | Confidentiality 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Each party (recipient) must keep secret and confidential,
and must not divulge or disclose any information relating to another party or
its business (which is disclosed to the recipient by the other party,
its representatives or advisers), any Transaction Agreement or the terms of
the Sale other than to the extent that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the information is in the public domain (other than by
breach of any obligation of confidentiality binding on the recipient); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the recipient is required to disclose the information by
applicable law or the rules of any recognised stock exchange on which its
shares or the shares of any of its Related Bodies Corporate are listed,
provided that the recipient has to the extent possible having regard to the
required timing of the disclosure consulted with the provider of the
information as to the form and content of the disclosure; 
---|---|--- 
 



page 48 ---|---|--- 
  Share Sale Agreement |  | 



      | (iii) | the disclosure is made by the recipient to its
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, Related Bodies
Corporate, financiers, lawyers, accountants, consultants or other professional
advisers to the extent necessary to enable the recipient to properly perform
its obligations under this agreement or to conduct their business generally,
in which case the recipient must ensure that such persons keep the information
secret and confidential and do not divulge or disclose the information to any
other person; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | the disclosure is necessary to seek satisfaction of any of
the conditions in clauses 2.1 or for the purposes of clause 9.3(a), provided
that the relevant Governmental Agency is made aware of the
confidential nature of the information and is instructed to keep the
information secret and confidential and does not divulge or disclose the
information to any other person; 
---|---|--- 



      | (v) | the disclosure is required by law in Australia or
elsewhere (other than under section 275 of the PPSA (Australia) to the extent
that disclosure is not required under that section if it would breach a duty
of confidence); 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | the disclosure is required for use in legal proceedings

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | On and from Completion: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Buyer may disclose confidential information relating to
the business of a Target Entity except to the extent that such information
relates to a Seller Group Member or its business; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | all parties are released from their obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that a person is unable to enforce
the benefit of this directly, the Seller or the Buyer (as the case may be)
holds the benefit of this clause on trust for that person in accordance with
clause 24.16. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Nothing in this agreement is to be construed as constituting
the consent of a party, with respect to a Security Interest created by this
agreement, to the disclosure of the terms of this agreement for the purpose
of section 275(7) of the PPSA (Australia). No party who is the grantor of a
Security Interest under this agreement will, after the Execution Date, consent

the purpose of section 275 of the PPSA (Australia). 
---|---|---

---|--- 



     | (a) | Unless otherwise provided for in this agreement, each party

     | (b) | Any action to be taken by the Buyer or the Seller in
performing its obligations under this agreement must be taken at its own cost

   19 | GST 
---|--- 



   19.1 | Definitions 
---|--- 

Unless clearly indicated to the contrary, "GST" and other terms used in this
clause 19 (and in other provisions of this agreement referable to GST) have
the meanings given to those terms by the GST Act.



   19.2 | GST 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If an amount of GST is payable on a supply under this
agreement: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the recipient of the supply must pay, in addition to the
other consideration payable or to be provided for the supply, an additional
amount equal to the GST payable on the supply; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | the recipient must pay the additional amount to the
supplier at the same time as the other consideration. 
---|---|--- 
 

However the recipient need not pay the additional amount until the supplier
gives the recipient a tax invoice (except where the recipient is required to
issue the tax invoice).



     | (b) | If for any reason (including, without limitation, the
occurrence of an adjustment event) the amount of GST payable on a supply
varies from the GST amount paid to the supplier, the parties will account to
each other for the difference. If the recipient is required to pay an
additional amount under this clause, and the reason an additional amount is
payable is because of the occurrence of an adjustment event, the recipient
need not pay the additional amount until the supplier gives the recipient an
adjustment note (except where the recipient is required to issue the
adjustment note). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | For the avoidance of doubt, clauses 19.2(a) and 19.2(b) do
not apply to the extent that the GST on the supply is payable by the recipient
under Division 83 or Division 84 of the GST Act. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | If an amount paid by the supplier as and for GST under this
agreement is overpaid, and section 105-65 of Schedule 1 to the TAA applies to
that amount (or in the event this section is repealed and another section of
the GST Act or of the TAA operates to restrict the payment of refunds of GST
overpaid to the supplier), then the amount is not recoverable from the
supplier unless the supplier can recover that amount from the Commissioner of
Taxation after taking all reasonable steps to do so. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | If any party is entitled to payment of any costs or expenses
by way of reimbursement or indemnity, the claim must exclude any amount for
which that party (or representative member if the party is a member of a
GST group) may obtain an input tax credit. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Unless clearly indicated to the contrary, all amounts
referred to in this agreement, other than in this clause, are GST exclusive.

    20 | Finalisation of schedules and wrong pockets 
---|--- 



   20.1 | Finalisation of schedules 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The parties acknowledge that, as at the Execution Date, the
following schedules are still in the process of being finalised and checked,
and may be incomplete and/or contain some inaccuracies: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | Schedule 9 (Property Leases); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Schedule 10 (Business Intellectual Property); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Schedule 11 (Business names); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Schedule 12 (Third Party Intellectual Property); 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | Schedule 15 (Licence Termination Letter); 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Schedule 16 (Seller Trade Marks); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | Schedule 18 (Insurance policies). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The parties will co-operate in good faith to check and
finalise those schedules as soon as practicable after the Execution Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Once a schedule is finalised in accordance with clause
20.1(b) above, it will be taken to constitute the relevant schedule in
substitution for the corresponding attachment to this agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



   20.2 | "Wrong pockets" 
---|--- 

Subject to clause 20.3, if the need for a correction to the information in
schedules is not identified until after Completion, and as a result:



     | (a) | a Business Asset owned by, or in the possession of, a member
of the Seller Group immediately prior to Completion is not transferred to the
ownership and possession of a member of the Buyer Group as a result of
the transactions effected under this agreement, the Seller must cause the
asset to be transferred to the Buyer upon written request; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the ownership or possession of a Seller Retained Asset is
transferred to the Buyer Group as a result of the transactions effected under
this agreement, the Buyer must cause the asset to be transferred to the Seller
upon written request. 
---|---|--- 



   20.3 | Not a value transfer 
---|--- 

This clause 20 is intended to:

 



     | (a) | provide a means for correction of errors in initial asset
allocation with respect to assets which are not material in value; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | with respect to material assets, where one party is assumed
from the perspective of pricing and the Completion Accounts to own the
relevant asset following the transactions effected under this agreement, but
in fact the other party owns the asset following the transactions, to
facilitate the transfer of the asset to the party which it was assumed would
be the owner of that asset. 
---|---|--- 
 

This clause will not require transfer of an asset where it would be
inconsistent with those intentions.

    21 | Guarantee by Buyers Guarantor 
---|--- 



   21.1 | Guarantee and indemnity 
---|--- 

The Buyers Guarantor:

 



     | (a) | unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Seller on
demand, the due and punctual performance of the Buyers obligations under this
agreement; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | as a separate and additional liability, indemnifies the
Seller against all Loss, actions, proceedings and judgments of any nature,
incurred by, brought, made or recovered against the Seller arising from any
default or delay in the due and punctual performance of the Buyers
obligations under this agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   21.2 | Extent of guarantee and indemnity 
---|--- 

The liability of the Buyers Guarantor under this clause 21 is not affected
by anything that, but for this clause 21, might operate to release or
exonerate the Buyers Guarantor in whole or in part from its obligations
