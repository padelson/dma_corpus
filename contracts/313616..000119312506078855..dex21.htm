AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of April 12, 2006,
by and among Danaher Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Smile
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the "Purchaser"), and Sybron Dental Specialties, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement the Purchaser has agreed to commence a
tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of the Companys common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, including the associated preferred stock purchase
rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of
December 8, 2000, between the Company and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as
Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement") (which Rights together with the shares
of the Companys common stock are hereinafter referred to as the "Shares" or
the "Common Shares"), at a price per Share of $47.00 net to the seller in cash
(such amount or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer being
hereinafter referred to as the "Offer Price"); 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (i)
approved the Offer and the Merger (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), (ii)
adopted this Agreement and is recommending that the Companys stockholders
accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the Purchaser, approve the Merger,
and adopt this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Purchaser (the "Purchaser
Board") and Parent (the "Parent Board") have approved the merger of the
Purchaser with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving
corporation (the "Merger"), in accordance with the DGCL, and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each of the
issued and outstanding Common Shares not owned directly or indirectly by
Parent, the Purchaser or the Company will be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price in cash; and

WHEREAS, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company agree as follows:



 

-1- ARTICLE ONE

THE OFFER

SECTION 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article Eight hereof and none of the events set forth in Annex I
hereto (the "Tender Offer Conditions") shall have occurred, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten (10) calendar days, Parent
shall cause the Purchaser to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) an offer to purchase
all outstanding Shares at the Offer Price, shall, upon commencement of the
Offer but after affording the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, file Schedule TO and all other necessary documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and make all deliveries,
mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange
Act, in each case in connection with the Offer (the "Offer Documents"), and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof. The obligation of the Purchaser to accept for
payment or pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer will be subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Annex I
hereto.

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall not
decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer,
impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend any other term of the Offer
in any manner adverse to the holders of Common Shares. The Offer shall remain
open until the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (as such term is
defined in Rule 14d-1(c)(6) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement of
the Offer (the "Expiration Date"), unless the Purchaser shall have extended
the period of time for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the two succeeding sentences or as may be required by applicable Law, in
which event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and date as
the Offer, as so extended, may expire; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Purchaser may provide a subsequent offering period after the Expiration Date,
in accordance with Rule 14d-ll under the Exchange Act. If at any Expiration
Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions is not satisfied or waived by the
Purchaser, the Purchaser may extend the Offer from time to time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, on the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, (i) if the
waiting period under the HSR Act or under any material applicable foreign
statutes or regulations applicable to the Merger shall have not expired or
been terminated, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time until
the expiration or termination under the HSR Act or any other material
applicable foreign statutes or regulations, (ii) if any of the conditions set
forth in paragraphs (a) or (b) of Annex I hereto shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time until the
earlier of (A) five (5) Business Days after the time such condition or
conditions shall no longer exist or (B) such time at which the matters
described in such paragraphs (a) or (b) shall have become final
and nonappealable; or (iii) if all of the Tender Offer Conditions are
satisfied and more than 50% but less than 90% of the outstanding Common Shares
on a fully diluted basis (excluding Options (as defined herein) which are not
exercisable for 60 days) have been validly tendered and not withdrawn in the
Offer, the Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to extend
the Offer from time to time up to a maximum of ten (10) 



 

-2-  additional Business Days in the aggregate. Subject to the terms of the Offer
and this Agreement and the satisfaction of all the Tender Offer Conditions as
of any Expiration Date, the Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
soon as practicable after such expiration date of the Offer. Without the prior
written consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall not accept for payment or
pay for any Shares in the Offer if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less
than the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition (as
defined in Annex I hereto).

 

(c) Parent and the Purchaser represent that the Offer Documents will comply in
all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities
laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent
or given to the Companys stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that no representation is made by Parent or the Purchaser with respect to
information supplied by the Company in writing for inclusion in the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and the Purchaser further agrees
to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to stockholders of the Company, in
each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws.

SECTION 1.2 _Company Actions_. 

(a) The Company shall, after affording Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, file with the SEC and mail to the holders of
Common Shares, as promptly as practicable on the date of the filing by Parent
and the Purchaser of the Offer Documents, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") reflecting the recommendation of the Company
Board that holders of Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer (the
"Company Recommendation") and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required
by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Schedule 14D-9 will set
forth, and the Company hereby represents, that the Company Board, at a meeting
duly called and held at which a quorum was present throughout, has unanimously
(i) determined that each of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
each of the Offer and the Merger, is fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Offer and adopted this
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, (iii) recommended acceptance of the
Offer and adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders (if such
approval and adoption are required by applicable Law), and (iv) taken all
other action necessary to render Section 203 of the DGCL and the Rights
inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended only prior to the
acceptance for payment of Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, and only to
the extent permitted by Section 6.2. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendations of the Company Board
described in this Section 1.2(a).



 

-3- (b) The Company represents that the Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and, on
the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to
the Companys stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by
Parent or the Purchaser in writing for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each
of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other
hand, agree promptly to correct any information provided by either of them
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading, and the Company further agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to the holders of Common Shares, in each case, as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Law.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish the
Purchaser with mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting
beneficial owner lists and any available listing or computer list containing
the names and addresses of the record holders of the Common Shares as of the
most recent practicable date and shall furnish the Purchaser with such
additional available information (including, but not limited to, updated lists
of holders of Common Shares and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of
security positions and non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other
assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the Companys record and beneficial stockholders.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent, the Purchaser and their
Affiliates, associates, agents and advisors, shall keep such information
confidential and use the information contained in any such labels, listings
and files only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, should the
Offer terminate or if this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver to the
Company all copies of such information then in their possession.

SECTION 1.3 _Directors_. 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the payment by
the Purchaser for Shares pursuant to the Offer representing at least such
number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, and from time to time
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is equal to
the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (determined
after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Common Shares
beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates bears to the total number of
Common Shares then outstanding, and the Company shall, upon request of Parent,
promptly take all actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be so
elected, including, if necessary, seeking the resignations of one or more
existing directors; provided, however, that Parent shall be entitled to
designate at least a majority of the directors on the Company Board (as long
as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the Common Shares
of the Company); _provided further_ , that prior to the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 2.2), the Company Board shall always have at least two
members who are not officers, directors, employees or designees of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates ("Purchaser Insiders").  



 

-4-  If the number of directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced below
two prior to the Effective Time, the remaining director who is not a
Purchaser Insider shall be entitled to designate a Person to fill such
vacancy who is not a Purchaser Insider and who shall be a director not deemed
to be a Purchaser Insider for all purposes of this Agreement.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect
to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under such
Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3.
Parent will supply to the Company any information with respect to itself and
its officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section and Rule.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
this Section 1.3 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or termination
of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or the
Purchaser or waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder, will require
the concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office
who are not Purchaser Insiders (or in the case where there are two or fewer
directors who are not Purchaser Insiders, the concurrence of one director who
is not a Purchaser Insider) if such amendment, termination, extension or
waiver could be reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the minority
stockholders of the Company.

ARTICLE TWO

waiver of the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement and the DGCL, at the Effective Time the Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Purchaser shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"),
and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware.

SECTION 2.2 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(a) and 7.1(b), but subject
to Sections 7.1(c) and 7.1(d), the Merger shall become effective as set forth
in the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") which shall be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The parties shall
take such other and further actions as may be required by Law to make the
Merger effective. The time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with
applicable Law is referred to herein as the "Effective Time."

SECTION 2.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
the Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and the Purchaser shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



 

-5- SECTION 2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Purchaser, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended, subject
to the provisions of Section 6.6 of this Agreement, in accordance with the
provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law.

(b) The Bylaws of the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until

accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

SECTION 2.5  _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of the
Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

SECTION 2.6 _Officers_. The individuals specified by Parent prior to the
Effective Time shall, subject to applicable Law, be the initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal. 

SECTION 2.7 _Conversion of Common Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) any Common Shares held by Parent, the Purchaser, any wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent or the Purchaser, in the treasury of the Company
or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, which Common Shares, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist with no payment being
made with respect thereto and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
3.1)), shall be cancelled and retired and shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price in cash (the "Merger Price"), payable to the holder
thereof, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such Common Share.

SECTION 2.8 _Conversion of Purchaser Common Stock_. The Purchaser has
outstanding 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of
which are entitled to vote with respect to approval of this Agreement. At the
Effective Time, each share of common stock of the Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



 

-6- SECTION 2.9 _Options; Restricted Shares; ESPP_.

(a) The following provisions shall apply to each outstanding option to
purchase Common Shares (the "Options") granted under the 2000 Long-
Term Incentive Plan, the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan, the 2000 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan and the 2005
Outside Directors Stock Option Plan, (each a "Stock Plan" and collectively
the "Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take all actions
reasonably requested by Parent to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.9(b) including, the passing of appropriate resolutions and the solicitation
of consent of each holder of an Option to the conversion of such Option into
the right to receive an amount in cash as described in this Section 2.9(b).
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall accelerate the
vesting of each unvested Option and each vested Option shall be exercisable,
without payment by the Option holder, in full settlement thereof, for the
right to receive, as soon as practicable (but no later than three (3) Business
Days after the Effective Time, unless additional time is required to process
such payments under the Companys payroll systems), an amount in cash (less
any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Price over (B) the per share exercise price of each
Common Share subject to such Option and (ii) the number of Common Shares
subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. No person
shall have any right under the Stock Plans or the Plans to acquire equity
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to the
issuance or grant of any right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive
benefits measured by the value of, or settleable in, Common Shares after the
Effective Time.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary to provide for the lapse of all forfeiture
provisions applicable to restricted shares (collectively, the "Company
Restricted Shares") issued pursuant to the 2006 Restricted Stock Incentive
Plan (the "Restricted Stock Plan") (or under any individual agreement with a
Company employee or current or former director of the Company) to the extent
such forfeiture provisions have not previously lapsed in accordance with the
terms of the Restricted Stock Plan (or the terms of any individual
agreement). Each holder of Company Restricted Shares will be treated as a
holder of the corresponding number of Common Shares as of the Effective Time
in accordance with Section 2.7 in the same manner as other outstanding Common
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to establish a New
Exercise Date (as defined under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"))
on the earlier of (1) last Business Day immediately prior to the Effective
Time or (2) the end of the purchase period under the ESPP outstanding on the
date hereof (the "ESPP Termination Date") and to notify each participant in
the ESPP in writing of the ESPP Termination Date at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the ESPP Termination Date. Each outstanding purchase option
under the ESPP on the ESPP Termination Date shall be exercised on such date
for the purchase of Common Shares at a Purchase Price (as defined in the ESPP)
per share equal to 85% of the Fair Market Value (as defined in the ESPP) of a
Common Share on the Enrollment Date (as defined in the ESPP) or on the ESPP
Termination Date, whichever is lower. In addition, the Company shall take any
and all actions with respect to the ESPP as are necessary to provide that (a)
participation in the ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were
participants on the date hereof and (b) such participants may not increase
their payroll deduction election or purchase elections from those in effect
on the date hereof.



 

-7- SECTION 2.10 _Stockholders  Meeting_ .

(a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law:

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders (the "Special Meeting") as soon as practicable following the
acceptance for payment of and payment for Common Shares by the Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer for the purpose of considering and taking action upon
this Agreement;

(ii) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to
this Agreement, and use its reasonable efforts (x) to obtain and furnish the
information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement (as
hereinafter defined) and, after consultation with Parent, to respond promptly
to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary
proxy statement and cause a definitive proxy statement (the "Proxy
Statement") to be mailed to its stockholders and (y) to obtain the necessary
approvals of the Merger and this Agreement by its stockholders;

(iii) subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, include in the
Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation that stockholders of the Company
vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement; and

(iv) include in the Proxy Statement the opinion of Credit Suisse Securities
USA LLC ("CS") referred to in Section 4.21.

(b) Parent agrees that it will vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Common
Shares then owned by it, the Purchaser or any of its other subsidiaries in
favor of the approval of the Merger and of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.11 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding Section
2.10, in the event that Parent, the Purchaser or any other subsidiary of
Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Common Shares pursuant
to the Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after the acceptance for payment of and payment for Common
Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

ARTICLE THREE

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES

SECTION 3.1 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.7, Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has demanded appraisal for such Common Shares in accordance with the DGCL
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into  



 

-8-  a right to receive the Merger Price, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal. If after the Effective
Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal, such Common Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Price. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Common Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
and to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

SECTION 3.2 _Payment for Common Shares_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, such bank or trust company as shall be
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company shall act as
paying agent (the "Paying Agent") in effecting the payment of the Merger Price
in respect of certificates (the "Certificates") that, prior to the Effective
Time, represented Common Shares entitled to payment of the Merger Price
pursuant to Section 2.7. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent or the
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the
aggregate Merger Price to which holders of Common Shares shall be entitled at
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.7.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each record holder of Certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Common Shares (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering such Certificates and receiving the Merger Price in respect
thereof. Upon the surrender of each such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
pay the holder of such Certificate the Merger Price multiplied by the number
of Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, in consideration
therefor, and such Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Common Shares held by Parent or the Purchaser, any wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent or the Purchaser, in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or Dissenting Shares) shall represent solely the
right to receive the Merger Price relating thereto. No interest or dividends
shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Price. If the Merger Price (or any
portion thereof) is to be delivered to any Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate formerly representing Common Shares surrendered
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such
Merger Price that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person surrendering such
Common Shares shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other similar
taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Price to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

(c) Promptly following the date which is 180 days after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash,
Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agents duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate formerly  



 

-9-  representing a Common Share may surrender such Certificate to the Surviving
Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) receive in consideration therefor the Merger Price relating
thereto, without any interest thereon.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Common Shares which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates formerly representing Common Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be surrendered and
cancelled in return for the payment of the Merger Price relating thereto
(subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws), as
provided in this Article Three.

SECTION 3.3 _Certificates; Withholding; Lost Certificates_. Until surrendered
as contemplated by Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Price. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Common Shares such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of such Common Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate and entry into
any other agreements or undertakings required by the Paying Agent, the Paying
Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Price.

ARTICLE FOUR

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and the Purchaser that, except
as disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2005, the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005 and the Companys Current Reports on
Form 8-K dated January 13, 2006, February 7, 2006, February 14, 2006 and
March 29, 2006 (in each case, as such reports have been amended as of the date
hereof, and including any documents filed as exhibits, annexes or
schedules thereto) or described in the section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule corresponding to the section of this Article Four to which exception
is being taken or in another section of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the
extent that (1) such other section is reasonably cross-referenced in the
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule to which the exception is being
taken or (2) the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent:

SECTION 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of  



 

-10-  Delaware. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
business entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing or
has comparable status under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
or organization. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the requisite
corporate or similar organizational power and authority to own, operate or
lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing or has comparable status, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the properties owned, operated or leased by it makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing (or comparable status) necessary,
except where the failure to have such power or authority, or the failure to be
so qualified, licensed or in good standing (or to have comparable status),
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has heretofore provided or
made available to Parent and the Purchaser a complete and correct copy of
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws
or comparable organizational documents, each as amended to the date hereof, of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and has provided a complete and
correct copy of the Rights Agreement.

SECTION 4.2 _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 250,000,000 Common
Shares and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $.01 per share
("Preferred Shares"). As of the close of business on April 7, 2006, 40,553,055
Common Shares were issued and outstanding, and no Common Shares were held in
treasury. Since such time and date, no additional Common Shares were issued,
and the number of Common Shares held in treasury has not changed, except, in
each case, for exercises of Options in accordance with their terms after the
date hereof and the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of
rights to purchase Common Shares under the ESPP in accordance with its terms
and the provisions of this Agreement. The Company has no Preferred Shares
issued or outstanding, and no Preferred Shares are reserved for issuance or
otherwise designated as a series or class other than 2,500,000 shares of
Series A Preferred Stock reserved under the Rights Agreement. No awards have
been made under the Restricted Stock Plan. No Common Shares are reserved for
issuance other than 11,100,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Stock Plans (consisting of 7,073,556 shares subject to outstanding
Options and 4,026,444 shares available for future grants), 500,000 shares
reserved for issuance under the ESPP, and 100,000 shares reserved for
issuance under the Restricted Stock Plan. Section 4.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of the date hereof the holders of all
outstanding Options and the number, exercise prices and expiration dates of
each grant to such holders. All the outstanding Common Shares are, and all
Common Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of outstanding
Options will, when issued in accordance with the respective terms of the
applicable Options, be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and are not and will not be subject to or issued in violation of,
any preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
Indebtedness having voting rights (or convertible into securities having
such rights) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("Voting Debt"),
whether issued by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person,
issued and outstanding. Except for the Options set forth on Section 4.2(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and rights to purchase Common Shares under
the ESPP, there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character obligating
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell or cause to
be issued, transferred or sold any capital stock or Voting Debt  



 

-11-  of, or other equity interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other
right, agreement, arrangement or commitment. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Common Shares or other capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No Subsidiary of the Company
owns any capital stock of the Company.

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all the
Subsidiaries of the Company, whether consolidated or unconsolidated.
All outstanding shares of capital stock in each Subsidiary: (i) are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company; (ii) have been validly issued and are
fully paid and non-assessable (subject, in the case of non-assessability of
capital stock of any Subsidiary that is organized or qualified to do business
under the laws of Wisconsin, to Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the Wisconsin
Business Corporation Law, as judicially interpreted, to the extent
applicable); (iii) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and
clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances or security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"); and (iv)
are free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership
interests) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of
such Subsidiarys business as currently conducted. Other than the
Subsidiaries of the Company, the Company does not own or control, directly or
indirectly, a 5% or greater equity interest in any Person.

SECTION 4.3 _Authority Relative to this Agreement and Related Matters_. The
Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and (subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval)
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized and approved by the Company Board and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are
necessary to authorize or approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
Company Stockholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger in
each case pursuant to the requirements of the DGCL). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and the Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares
in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement (the "Company Stockholder
Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any capital stock of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary necessary to approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The Company has taken
all appropriate actions so that the restrictions on business combinations
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply with respect to or as a
result of the Offer, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and that no further action on the part of the
stockholders or the Company Board is required to effect such non-application
of Section 203 of the DGCL. No other state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation applies or purports to apply to the Offer, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

-12- SECTION 4.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i)
conflict with or violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended
and Restated Bylaws of the Company or the comparable organizational documents
of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming that all Consents described in
Section 4.4(b) have been made or obtained and the Company Stockholder Approval
is received, conflict with or violate any federal, state, local, foreign or
supranational Law, statute, ordinance, code, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, stipulation, writ, injunction, award, permit or license
(collectively, "Law") applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound or affected, or (iii) result in a violation or breach of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in any loss of any benefit, or the
creation of any Lien on any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (any of the foregoing referred to in clause (ii) above or
this clause (iii) being a "Company Violation") pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, other
than, in the case of clause (ii) or clause (iii) above, any such Company
Violations that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) Other than (i) the filing with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice of a premerger notification
and report form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (ii) the requirements
of the Exchange Act and any applicable state securities, "blue sky" or
takeover Law, and (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of Delaware, none of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby does or will require any consent, waiver, approval, authorization or
permit of, or registration or filing with or notification to (any of the
foregoing being a "Consent"), any domestic, foreign or supranational
government or subdivision thereof, administrative, governmental or regulatory
authority, agency, commission, tribunal or body or self-regulatory
organization (each a "Governmental Entity"), except for any such Consents, the
failure of which to be made or obtained, would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

SECTION 4.5 _SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company has filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules,
registration statements, proxy statements, certifications and other documents
required to be filed by the Company or its directors and executive officers
(in their capacity as such) with the SEC since January 1, 2002 (as they have
been amended since the time of their filing, and including any documents
filed as exhibits, annexes or schedules thereto, collectively, the "Company
SEC Reports") and complete and correct copies of all such Company SEC Reports
are available to  



 

-13-  Parent through public sources. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC
Reports (including but not limited to any financial statements or
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein) complied as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder) (the "Securities Act") applicable, as the case may
be, to such Company SEC Reports, and none of the Company SEC Reports
contained, as of the date of filing and of any amendment or supplement and, in
the case of any proxy statement, at the date mailed to stockholders and at
the date of the meeting, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Reports comply as to form in all material respects with all
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations and
cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates or
for the periods presented therein. The Company has heretofore furnished to
Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications which
have not yet been filed with the SEC to agreements, documents or other
instruments which previously had been filed by the Company with the
SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

(b) There are no outstanding loans made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of the Company. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made
any loans to any executive officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(c) The management of the Company has (i) implemented disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries,
is made known to the management of the Company by others within those
entities, which disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
reasonable assurance level in timely alerting the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in the Companys periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board
(A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data
and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. A summary of any of those disclosures made by management
to the Companys auditors and audit committee has previously been provided to
Parent.

(d) Since January 1, 2002, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or  



 

-14-  representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any complaint, allegation, assertion, or claim that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof or to any director or
officer of the Company.

SECTION 4.6 _Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Certain Changes_.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
except for (i) liabilities and obligations that are specifically disclosed on
the audited balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2005 (the
"Company Balance Sheet") or in the notes thereto, and (ii) liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2005, that are not and would not, individually or
in the aggregate with all other liabilities and obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (other than those disclosed on the Company Balance
Sheet), reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company Balance Sheet
reflects reasonable reserves in accordance with GAAP for contingent
liabilities relating to pending litigation and other contingent obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (including liabilities under escheat and
similar Laws).

(b) Since September 30, 2005, (i) there has not been any Material Adverse
Effect on the Company or any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of
facts that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (ii) the businesses of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been conducted only in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (iii) there
has not been any action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during
the period from September 30, 2005 through the date of this Agreement that, if
taken during the period from the date of this Agreement though the Effective
Time, would constitute a breach of Sections 6.1(b)(i) (except as contemplated
by Section 4.18 of this Agreement), (ii), (iii) (except for issuances under
the ESPP), (vi) (with respect to the period from January 1, 2006 through the
date of this Agreement), (vii), (viii), (ix)(other than subsection
6.1(b)(ix)(E)), (xv), (xviii) and (xix).

and have complied since January 1, 2003, with all applicable Environmental

the Company has there ever been, on or in any Company Property: (A) any
Release, (B) any treatment, recycling, disposal or storage, other than short
term storage prior to removal by a licensed transporter for off-site disposal,
of any hazardous waste, as that term is defined under RCRA or any state
equivalent, or (C) any underground storage tank or surface impoundment or
landfill or waste pile, except, in the case of each of the foregoing, for
such events which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

(c) There is not now on or in any Company Property any polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCB) used in the Companys operations in pigments, hydraulic
oils, electrical transformers or other equipment except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

Liability Act, 42 USC §9601 et seq., as amended, and any regulations

-17- SECTION 4.9 _Material Contracts_.

(a) Except as set forth in the exhibit index for the Companys Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2005 or as permitted pursuant
to Section 6.1, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or bound by (i) any agreement relating to the incurring of Indebtedness by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in an amount in excess of $2,000,000 in
the aggregate, including any such agreement which contains provisions that
restrict, or may restrict, the conduct of business of the issuer thereof as
currently conducted (collectively, "Instruments of Indebtedness"), (ii)
any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) any non-competition or exclusive dealing
agreement, or any other agreement or obligation which purports to limit or
restrict in any material respect (A) the ability of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to solicit customers or (B) the manner in which, or the
localities in which, all or any portion of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or, following consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries, is or would be conducted, or any
non-competition or exclusive dealing agreement, or any other agreement or
obligation of the type described in (A) or (B) of this clause (iii) which
following the Closing would purport to apply to Parent or any of its
Affiliates other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iv) any agreement
providing for the indemnification, in excess of $1,000,000, by the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company of any Person other than standard form indemnity
provisions in agreements with customers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (v) any joint venture or partnership agreement, (vi)
any agreement that grants any right of first refusal or right of first offer
or similar right or that limits or purports to limit the ability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to own, operate, sell, transfer, pledge or
otherwise dispose of any material assets or business, (vii) any contract or
agreement providing for any payments in excess of $1,000,000 that are
conditioned, in whole or in part, on a change of control of the Company or any

agreement material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
pertaining to the use of or granting any right to use or practice any rights
under any Intellectual Property, (x) any agreements pursuant to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases any material real property or leases
any material real property to third parties, (xi) any contract or agreement
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, providing for

offerings of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (xii) any contract or other
agreement to which Apogent Technologies Inc. ("Former Company Parent") or any
of its present or former Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound, and
(xiii) any other contract or other agreement not made in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice that (A) is material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (B) would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the agreements, contracts
and obligations listed in clauses (i) through (xiii) being referred to herein
as "Company Material Contracts"). None of the Company Material Contracts
contains a "most favored nation" clause or other term providing preferential
pricing or treatment to a third party. Section 4.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of the date hereof all of the Company
Material Contracts.



 

-18- (b) Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company (or, to
the extent a Subsidiary of the Company is a party, such Subsidiary) and, to
the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, and each Company
Material Contract is in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in breach or default under any Company Material Contract
or is aware of any condition that with the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both would result in such a breach or default, except in each case
where any such breaches or defaults would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company knows
of, or has received written notice of, any breach or default under (nor, to
the knowledge of the Company, does there exist any condition which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a breach
or default under) any Company Material Contract by any other party thereto
except where any such violation or default would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

(c) There are no provisions in any Instrument of Indebtedness that provide
any restrictions on the repayment of the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder,
or that require that any financial payment (other than payment of outstanding
principal and accrued interest) be made in the event of the repayment of the
outstanding Indebtedness thereunder prior to expiration. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Indebtedness" of a Person shall mean (i) all obligations of such
Person for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations of such Person evidenced by
bonds, debentures, notes and similar instruments, (iii) all leases of such
Person capitalized in accordance with GAAP, and (iv) all obligations of such
Person under sale-and-lease back transactions, agreements to repurchase
securities sold and other similar financing transactions.

SECTION 4.10  _Litigation_. There are no suits, claims, actions, proceedings
or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any outstanding orders, writs, injunctions or decrees that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

SECTION 4.11 _Information_. None of the information supplied by the Company
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Offer
Documents, (ii) the Proxy Statement or (iii) any other document to be filed
with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Other Filings") will, at the
respective times filed with the SEC or other Governmental Entity and, in
addition, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the date it or any amendment
or supplement is mailed to stockholders, at the time of the Special Meeting
and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by the
Company with respect to statements made therein based on information supplied
by Parent or the Purchaser in writing specifically for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement.



 

-19- SECTION 4.12 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes a complete
list of all material Employee Benefit Arrangements and all
Material Employment Agreements.

(b) With respect to each Plan, the Company has delivered or made available to
Parent a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing constituting a
part of such Plan, including all plan documents, employee communications,
benefit schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding
vehicles; (ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and
accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current summary plan description and
any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not
required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent annual financial
report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (vi) the
most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), if
any. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a true, correct
and complete copy of each Material Employment Agreement. Except as
specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered to Parent, there
are no amendments to any Plan or Material Employment Agreement that have been
adopted or approved nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries committed
to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Plan or Material
Employment Agreement.

(c) Section 4.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Plan
that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code ("Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination
letter with respect to each Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not
been revoked, or there is pending, or time remaining in which to file, an
application for such a determination letter, and the Company knows of no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that could adversely affect
the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or the related trust and which
would not be correctible under the Employee Plans Correction
Resolution System without material cost to the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Section 4.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each trust
funding to any Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section
501(c)(9), and each such trust meets such requirements and provides no
disqualified benefits (as such term is defined in Code Section 4976(b)).

(d) All contributions required to be made to any Plan by applicable Law or by
any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or
payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Plan, for any period
through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full. Each Plan that
is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (i) is
funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit
fund" with the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is unfunded.

(e) With respect to each Plan, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all Laws applicable to such Plans. Each Plan
has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms.
There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that could give rise to, any
requirement for the posting of security with respect to a Plan or the
imposition of any lien on the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under ERISA or the Code.



 

-20- (f) With respect to each Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does not exist any
accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) the fair market value of
the assets of such Plan exceeds the present value of the accumulated benefit
obligation as determined in accordance with U.S. Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 87, as reflected in the 2005 Financial
Statements; (iii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c)
of ERISA for which the thirty (30)-day notice requirement has not been waived
has occurred since January 2, 2000, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such
reportable event; (iv) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid in full; (v) no liability
(other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (vi)
the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Plan and, to the
Companys knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such
proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section
4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to
administer, any such Plan.

(g) (i) No Employee Benefit Arrangement is a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple
Employer Plan"); (ii) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6)
years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full.

(h) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result
in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction
described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. 

(i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health,
medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, premiums for which
are either paid by the employee or other qualified beneficiary or, are
not, in the aggregate, material. There has been no communication to employees
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be
interpreted to promise or guarantee such employees retiree health or life
insurance or other retiree death benefits on a permanent basis.

(j) Section 4.12(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate
and complete list of any Plan or Material Employment Agreement under which
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any related event could (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or could  



 

-21-  limit the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Plan or related trust or
any Material Employment Agreement or related trust. As of the date hereof,
the Company has provided to Parent, with respect to each of Messrs. Pickrell,
Tomassi, Even, Pitz, Semmelmayer, Zee, Trapani and Yorba (i) the number,
vesting dates, exercise price (to the extent applicable), and term (to the
extent applicable) of all equity and equity-based compensation awards held by
each such individual, (ii) the annual base salary as of the date hereof,
annual bonus amounts for each of 2003, 2004 and 2005 of each such individual
(except for Mr. Pitzs 2005 bonus amount which has been annualized for his
partial year of employment) for 2006, the pro rata bonus for each such
individual, in each case, that may be paid or provided in connection with the
Merger (alone or in conjunction with any other events) and (iii) total gross
income listed on each individuals W-2 for each of the last five taxable years
(2001-2005), or for any shorter period during which each individual was
employed by the Company. No employee other than the employees named in this
Section 4.12(j) is entitled to a gross-up payment with respect to the
imposition of any tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

(k) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any other Person, including
any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of
the Plans or their related trusts, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Person that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation
to indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

(l) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and, to Companys
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit, against the Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to the Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor, any
Multiemployer Plan, any Plan, any participant in a Plan, or any other party.

(m) All material Employee Benefit Arrangements subject to the Law of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in all
material respects in accordance with all applicable requirements, (ii) if they
are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all necessary
requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

(n) Each Option has been granted with an exercise price no less than the "fair
market value" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) of a Common
Share as of the grant date and the term of no Option has been extended after
the grant date of such Option (except for extensions that would not result in
the imposition of taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code).



 

-22- SECTION 4.13 _Labor Matters_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, no employees of the Company or of any of
its Subsidiaries are represented by any labor union or any
collective bargaining organization. As of the date of this Agreement, no
labor organization or group of employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and
there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding presently pending or, to the Companys knowledge,
threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or
any other labor relations tribunal or authority. To the Companys knowledge
as of the date hereof no facts or event exists that is likely to give rise to
a violation of Section 4.13 on or before the Effective Time.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, with respect to employees
of and service providers of the Company: the Company complies and has
complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and
wages and hours, including any such Law respecting employment discrimination,
workers compensation, family and medical leave, the Immigration Reform and
Control Act, and occupational safety and health requirements, and no claims or
investigations are pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened with
respect to such Law, either by private individuals or by governmental
agencies; and all United States employees are at will.

(c) To the Companys knowledge, it is not, nor has it been, engaged in any
material unfair labor practice within the past three (3) years. There is not
now, nor within the past three (3) years has there been, any unfair labor
practice complaint against the Company pending or, to the Companys knowledge,
threatened, before the National Labor Relations Board or any other comparable
foreign or domestic authority or any workers council, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(d) No material grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out of or under
collective bargaining agreements or employment relationships (involving more
than one employee) is pending, and no claims therefor exist or have, to the
Companys knowledge, been threatened; no labor strike, lock-out, slowdown, or
work stoppage is pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened against or
directly affecting the Company.

(e) All Persons who are or were performing services for the Company and are or
were classified as independent contractors do or did satisfy and have
satisfied the requirements of Law to be so classified, and the Company has
fully and accurately reported their compensation on IRS Forms 1099 when
required to do so, except where any such failure would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

material Intellectual Property is subject to termination or cancellation or
change in its terms or provisions as a result of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, there is no material unauthorized use,
infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property. The
Intellectual Property constitutes all the intellectual property necessary or
appropriate to conduct the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have such Intellectual
Property would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and upon consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall (i) have good, valid and  



 

-24-  unencumbered title to all Owned Intellectual Property and (ii) have valid
right to use all Licensed Intellectual Property to the same extent
such Licensed Intellectual Property and Owned Intellectual Property are
currently used in the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(d) No material claim has been asserted or, to the knowledge of the Company,
is threatened by any Person nor does the Company have knowledge of any valid
ground for any bona fide claims (i) to the effect that the manufacture,
sale, offer for sale, importation or use of any trademark, service mark,
certification mark, domain name, product, service or process as used
(currently or in the past) or offered or proposed for manufacture, use, offer
for sale, importation or sale by the Company infringes, misappropriates,
violates, dilutes or constitutes the unauthorized use of any copyright, trade
secret, patent, trademark, tradename or other intellectual property right of
any Person, (ii) against the Company relating to the use of any Intellectual
Property, or (iii) challenging the ownership, scope, validity or
enforceability of any Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of Company, all
items set forth on Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are
valid, enforceable and subsisting.

(e) No Intellectual Property is subject to any Law or agreement restricting in
any manner the licensing, assignment or other transfer, use or enforceability
thereof by the Company. The Company has not entered into any agreement to
indemnify any other Person against any charge of infringement of any
Intellectual Property, except indemnities agreed to in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice in connection with the sale, delivery
or transfer of Company products and services or included as part of the
Companys license agreements. The Company or its Subsidiaries have the
exclusive right to file, prosecute and maintain all applications and
registrations with respect to Intellectual Property owned by the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.15 _Taxes_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all federal, state,
local and foreign income Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all other
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it. All such Tax Returns were
true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has paid or caused to be paid all material Taxes in respect
of the periods covered by such Tax Returns. The 2005 Financial Statements of
the Company reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for all Tax
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries through the date thereof. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely withheld and paid all material
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor, stockholder or
other third party. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
material Tax Return. There are no material security interests on any of the
assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any
failure to pay any Tax. There is no claim or dispute concerning any material
Tax liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries either (i) claimed or raised
by any authority in writing or (ii) as to which any of the directors and
officers (and employees responsible for Tax matters) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has knowledge based on personal contact with any agent of such
authority. No issue has been raised in writing in any examination by any
authority with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary which, by application
of similar principles, reasonably could be expected to result in a proposed
material  



 

-25-  increase in Tax, in excess of that provided for in any reserve for Taxes,
for any other period not so examined. All income Tax Returns required to be
filed by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries through
the year ended September 30, 2001 have been examined by the IRS or other
appropriate taxing authority and the examination concluded, or are Tax Returns
with respect to which the period during which any assessments may be made by
the IRS or other appropriate taxing authority has expired (taking into account
any extension or waiver thereof). All material deficiencies and assessments
asserted as a result of such examinations or other audits by federal, state,
local or foreign taxing authorities have been paid, fully settled or
adequately provided for in the Companys financial statements, and no issue or
claim has been asserted in writing for material Taxes by any taxing authority
for any prior period, other than those heretofore paid or provided for in the
Companys financial statements. There are no outstanding agreements or waivers
extending the statutory period of limitation applicable to any Tax Return of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of a group filing consolidated returns for
federal income Tax purposes (except for the group of which the Company is the
common parent), (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferor or
successor, by contract or otherwise, or (iii) is a party to a Tax sharing or
Tax indemnity agreement or any other agreement of a similar nature involving a
material amount of Taxes that remains in effect. The Company has not
constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"
(within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of
stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of
the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement (or
will constitute such a corporation in the two (2) years prior to the Effective
Time) or (ii) in a distribution that otherwise constitutes part of a "plan"
or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of
the Code) in conjunction with the Merger. The Company has not been a United
States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. The Company has complied in all material
respects with the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, dated as
of December 11, 2000, by and between Former Company Parent and the Company.
None of the Companys foreign Subsidiaries has been a member of any group that
has filed a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return, other than such Tax
Returns for which the period of assessment has expired (taking into account
any extension or waiver thereof). None of the Companys foreign Subsidiaries
is (i) engaged in a United States trade or business for United States federal
income tax purposes or (ii) a "passive foreign investment company" (within
the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code).

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Tax" or "Taxes" mean all
taxes, charges, fees, levies or other assessments, including, income, gross
receipts, excise, property, sales, transfer, license, payroll, withholding,
capital stock and franchise taxes, imposed by the United States or any state,
local or foreign government or subdivision or agency thereof, including any
interest, penalties or additions thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Tax Return" means any report, return or other information or document
required to be supplied to a taxing authority in connection with Taxes.

SECTION 4.16 _Insurance_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintain
all forms of insurance as, in its good faith judgment, are reasonable and
customary in amount and  



 

-26-  scope for companies in the industry in which they operate. Each of such
policies and other forms of insurance is in full force and effect on the date
hereof and shall (or comparable replacement or substitutions therefor shall)
be kept in full force and effect by the Company through the Effective Time.
All premiums with respect thereto due and payable on or prior to the Effective
Time have been paid or will be paid prior to the Effective Time, and no
written (or to the knowledge of the Company other) notice of cancellation or
termination has been received with respect to any such policy.

SECTION 4.17 _Relationships with Customers, Suppliers, Distributors and Sales
Representatives_. The Company has not received any written (or to
the knowledge of the Company other) notice that any customer, supplier,
distributor or sales representative intends to cancel, terminate or otherwise
modify or not renew its relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary, and,
to the Companys knowledge, no such action has been threatened, which
individually or in the aggregate, would in any such case reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

SECTION 4.18 _Rights Agreement_. The Company has amended the Rights Agreement
so that (a) Parent and the Purchaser are each exempt from the definition of
"Acquiring Person" contained in the Rights Agreement, and no "Stock
Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" or "Triggering Event" (as such terms
are defined in the Rights Agreement) will occur as a result of the execution
or delivery of this Agreement, the making of the Offer, the acquisition of
Common Shares pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) the Rights
Agreement will terminate and the Rights will expire immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Rights Agreement, as so amended, has not been further
amended or modified. True and complete copies of all such amendments to the
Rights Agreement have been previously provided to Parent.

SECTION 4.19 _Product Recalls_. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company: (a) the Company is not aware of any pattern or series of claims
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has resulted in or
reasonably could be expected to result in a generalized product recall
relating to products sold by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
regardless of whether such product recall is formal, informal, voluntary or
involuntary and (b) there is no material design, manufacturing or other
defect in any product or product category of the Company or any Subsidiary or
any specifications relating thereto.

SECTION 4.20 _Brokers_. Except for the engagement of CS, none of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers, directors or
employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for
any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has previously
disclosed to Parent the Companys fee arrangements with CS pursuant to its
engagement letter, as amended or modified, and any related agreements.

SECTION 4.21 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company Board has received
the written opinion of CS to the effect that, as of April 11, 2006, the
consideration to be received by the holders of Common Shares (other than
Parent and its Affiliates) pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, is fair to
such holders from a financial point of view.

operate or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
properties owned, operated or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing
or good standing necessary, except where the failure to have such power or

would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger.

SECTION 5.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. The Parent and the
Purchaser have all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of

acceleration or cancellation of, or result in any loss of any benefit, or the
creation of any Lien on any of the properties or assets of Parent or the

above being a "Parent Violation") pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or the Purchaser is a party or by
which Parent or the Purchaser or any of their respective properties or assets
may be bound or affected, other than, in the case of clause (ii) or clause

hereby does or will require any Consent of any Governmental Entity except for
any such Consents, the failure of which to be made or obtained, would not have
a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Purchaser specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Other Filings will, at the respective times filed with the SEC or other

investigation pending or threatened against Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, and none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any

nor any of the officers and directors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that the Company shall cause its and its
Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives (including any investment

knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a
transaction to effect, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) have any discussion with or
provide any information or data to any Person relating to a Takeover Proposal
or engage in any negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal (except solely to
inform a Person who has made an unsolicited request or approach of the
existence of this Section 6.2), (iii) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of any Takeover Proposal, or (iv)
enter into any agreement regarding any Takeover Proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement, a "Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or

(A) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of (1) assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that generate 15% or more of the net revenues or

Company or of any Subsidiary thereof, (B) any purchase or sale of, or tender

merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, share exchange, stock purchase or similar transaction involving
the Company (or any one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, individually or

net income or total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, immediately prior to such transaction).

(b) If and only to the extent that (A) Shares shall not have been purchased in
the Offer, (B) a Takeover Proposal has been received and not withdrawn, (C)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that such Takeover Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, and it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (D) such
Takeover Proposal was not solicited by it and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 6.2, and (E) the Company provides prior written notice
to Parent of its decision to take such action not less than twenty-four (24)
hours prior to taking such action, the Company shall be permitted to (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
that has previously been provided to Parent to such Person pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement having terms at least as favorable to
the Company as the Confidentiality Agreement, (y) participate in discussions
with such Person, and (z) if the Company Board determines after consulting
with its financial advisors and legal counsel that such Takeover Proposal is
a Superior Proposal, effect a Change in the Company Recommendation.



 

-34- For the purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_
written proposal or offer made by a Person other than a party hereto that (1)
is for a Takeover Proposal (except that references in the definition of
"Takeover Proposal" to "15%" shall be "50%") and (2) is on terms that the
Company Board in good faith concludes (after consulting with its financial
advisors and outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, the
likelihood of consummation and all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal and of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the parties to this Agreement,
would result in a transaction that (x) if consummated is more favorable to the
Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) is reasonably likely to be
consummated.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by Section 6.2(b), neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the
approval of the Agreement, the Merger or the Company Recommendation or take
any action or make any statement inconsistent with such approval or Company
Recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Company Recommendation"),
or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
any Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company
Recommendation shall include any approval or recommendation (or public
proposal to approve or recommend), by the Company Board of a Takeover
Proposal, or any failure by the Company Board to recommend against a Takeover
Proposal.

(d) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its officers, directors
and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any Person (other than the parties hereto) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, and Parent agrees that no
such prior activity shall be considered solicitation of a Takeover Proposal
hereunder.

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in the other
provisions of this Section 6.2, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any
request for information relating to a Takeover Proposal, or of any Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Takeover
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such request or Takeover
Proposal, and shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
provide a copy of any written request or Takeover Proposal (or document
relating to a Takeover Proposal) to Parent. The Company will keep Parent
promptly and fully informed of the status and details (including amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such request or Takeover Proposal and shall
promptly provide to Parent a copy of any non-public information furnished to
the Person who made such Takeover Proposal.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with
outside counsel, failure so to disclose would violate its obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure relating to
a Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in the Company
Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation
in such disclosure.



 

-35- (g) The Company Board shall recommend to the Companys stockholders the
approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
Board shall not be required to make such Company Recommendation to the extent
that it effects a Change in the Company Recommendation in accordance with
Section 6.2(b). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
6.2(g) or its other obligations under this Section 6.2 shall not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
the Company of any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding any Change in the
Company Recommendation, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent, this
Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company
at the Special Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the
Company of such obligation. The Company shall use its best efforts to hold
the Special Meeting as soon as practicable, and the Company shall otherwise
coordinate and cooperate with Parent with respect to the timing of the Special
Meeting.

SECTION 6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date hereof
through the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
Law, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives to afford to Parent and the Purchaser and to their respective
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives (the "Parent Representatives") reasonable access during
normal business hours to such of the properties, books, contracts,
commitments, records, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and such financial and operating data and such other information
with respect to the business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent, the Purchaser or Parent Representatives may reasonably
request. In addition, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each material
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it with
any Governmental Entity and (b) the internal or external reports prepared
by it and/or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course that are reasonably
required by Parent promptly after such reports are made available to the
Companys personnel. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information to the extent such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such
Person or contravene any applicable Law, in which latter case the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall provide access to or disclose such information to the
fullest extent permitted by such Law and shall cooperate with Parent in
seeking all necessary exemptions, permits or other consents or approvals to
permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide Parent (or, if necessary,
its counsel or other representatives in lieu of Parent) access to or to
disclose to Parent, such information. Parent shall hold any such information
in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the letter agreement dated as of March 13, 2006, between Parent
and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). Any investigation by Parent shall not affect the representations
and warranties of the Company.

SECTION 6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts  



 

-36-  (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to promptly take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Offer,
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) cooperation in the preparation
and filing of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and any actions or
filings related thereto, (ii) obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of
all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) obtaining all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (v) publicly supporting this Agreement and the Merger and (vi)
executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. In addition, if at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event or circumstance relating to either the Company or Parent or the
Purchaser or any of their respective subsidiaries should be discovered by the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, which should be set forth in an
amendment to the Offer Documents or Schedule 14D-9, the discovering party will
promptly inform the other party of such event or circumstance.

(b) Parent and the Company shall file as soon as practicable (but not later
than ten (10) Business Days in the case of the HSR Act filings) after the
date of this Agreement notifications under the HSR Act or under any material
applicable foreign statutes or regulations applicable to the Merger and shall
respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries or requests received from
the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or such other domestic or foreign antitrust regulatory authority, as
applicable for additional information or documentation and shall respond as
promptly as practicable to all inquiries and requests received from any State
Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust
matters. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings or responses, including providing copies of all
such documents to the other party and its advisors prior to filing or
responding

(c) Parent and the Company shall (1) promptly notify the other party of any
communication to that party from any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Transactions
contemplated herein; (2) if practicable, permit the other party the
opportunity to review in advance all the information relating to Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
incorporate the other partys reasonable comments; (3) not participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any filing, investigation, or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein unless it consults with the other party in
advance, and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend; and (4) furnish the other party with
copies of all correspondences, filings, and written communications between
them and their Subsidiaries and representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except that any
materials concerning valuation of the transaction or internal financial
information may be redacted.



 

-37- (d) Each of the parties will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as
promptly as practicable all Consents of any Governmental Entity or any other
person required in connection with, and waivers of any Company Violations and
Parent Violations, as applicable, that may be caused by, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall
not, without Parents prior written consent, and Parent shall not be obligated
to, agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise materially restrict the use
or operation of any portion of the business or assets of Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing if it
would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 6.5 _Public Announcements_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to consult promptly with each
other prior to issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, agree to provide to the other party for review a copy of
any such press release or statement, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and
review, unless required by applicable law or any listing agreement with a
securities exchange.

SECTION 6.6 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company (the "Indemnified
Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
such individual is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in respect of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as
of the date hereof, and shall advance fees and expenses (including attorneys
fees) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as of the date hereof.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to assume the defense of any
action, suit, investigation or proceeding and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of separate
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Party advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between
the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_  



 

-38-  that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for the fees of more than
one counsel for all Indemnified Parties, other than one local counsel in
each jurisdiction, unless a conflict of interest shall be caused thereby, and
_provided further_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent.

(c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those Company officers and directors who are
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount
no less favorable to the Companys directors and officers currently covered by
such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
_provided that_ the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
Parent or its Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable to such directors or officers; _provided further_
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate
annual premiums for insurance under this Section 6.6(c) in excess of 200% of
the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the fiscal year ended September
30, 2005 (which amount is set forth on Section 6.6 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule) on an annualized basis for such purpose and, if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to use its reasonable best efforts obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. In lieu of
the purchase of such insurance, the Surviving Corporation may in its
discretion purchase a six-year extended reporting period endorsement under
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance coverage providing
at least the same level of insurance coverage as would otherwise be required
to be maintained by the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.6(c). 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, Parent shall cause
such action to be taken as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume
all of the applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, if any action, suit or proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Party and written notice of such action, suit or proceeding is
provided to Parent by such Indemnified Party, on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall
continue in effect with respect to such action, suit or proceeding until the
final disposition thereof.

(f) This Section 6.6 shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs, executors and personal representatives, and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. This Section 6.6 shall not limit or otherwise adversely affect
any rights any Indemnified Party may have under any agreement with the
Company.



 

-39- SECTION 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify each other of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
fact or event which would be reasonably likely (1) to cause any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time or
(2) to cause any covenant, condition or agreement under this Agreement not to
be complied with or satisfied, and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations or warranties of any party or the conditions to
the obligations of any party hereunder. Each of the Company, Parent and the
Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the other parties hereof of any notice
or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.8 _Rights Agreement_. The Company covenants and agrees that it will
not (a) redeem the Rights, (b) amend the Rights Agreement or (c) take any
action which would allow any Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) other
than Parent or the Purchaser to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the Common Shares without causing a "Stock Acquisition Date" or
"Distribution Date" or "Triggering Event" (as each such term is defined in the
Rights Agreement) to occur. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make a determination that Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates or Associates is an "Acquiring Person" for purposes of the Rights
Agreement.

SECTION 6.9 _State Takeover Laws_. The Company shall, upon the request of the
Purchaser, take all reasonable steps to assist in any challenge by
the Purchaser to the validity or applicability to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, of any
state takeover law.

SECTION 6.10 _Parent Agreement Concerning Purchaser_. Parent agrees to cause
the Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 6.11 _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Parent and the Company agree that, in order
to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of the
Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act in connection with the Offer and the Merger, both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that such persons not be subject to
a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and for that compensatory and retentive
purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.11. Promptly after the date
hereof, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Common Shares resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law.

SECTION 6.12 _Company Subsidiaries_. The Company agrees to cause each of its
Subsidiaries to comply with the obligations applicable to such Subsidiary
under this Agreement.



 

-40- SECTION 6.13 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes which
become payable in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time.

SECTION 6.14 _Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements_. During the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries is a party and which relates to the confidentiality of
information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or which relate to
securities of the Company, other than client and customer agreements entered
into by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. During such period, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by using
reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof
in any court having jurisdiction.

SECTION 6.15 _Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements_.

(a) Parent agrees that it will cause the Surviving Corporation from and after
the Effective Time to honor all Employee Benefit Arrangements and all
Employment Agreements; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall
be interpreted as limiting the power of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
terminate the employment of any Company Employee (as defined below) or to
amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Arrangement or Employment Agreement
subject to its terms and applicable Law. Following the Effective Time, active
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Company Employees") may, in
the discretion of Parent, continue in the Employee Benefit Arrangements or
become eligible for the employee benefit plans and arrangements of Parent or
its Affiliates on the same terms as such plans and arrangements are generally
offered from time to time to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates .

(b) For purposes of vesting and eligibility, but not benefit accrual, under
the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits
after the Effective Time, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
respective predecessors) before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Plan, except to the extent such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits or is prohibited under applicable Law or the
terms of the applicable plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, except to the extent prohibited under applicable Law or the
terms of the applicable Plan: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its Affiliates for the benefit of
Company Employees (such plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time; (ii) Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting
periods and actively-at-work  



 

-41-  requirements of each New Plan to be waived for each Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent currently applicable to such persons
and waived under the corresponding Plan of the Company for the year in which
the Effective Time occurs; (iii) provide each Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to becoming eligible to participate in such New Plan, to the same extent such
credit was given under the corresponding Plan, in satisfying any applicable
deductible or annual maximum out-of-pocket requirements under such New Plan;
and (iv) apply any increase in the Company Employees portion of the premium
cost, deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs no earlier than
the first day of the first plan year beginning after the Effective Time of
either the Plan or the New Plan (as applicable).

(c) Entitlement to paid time off of Company Employees accrued as of the
Effective Time shall not be reduced; provided, however, that paid time off
accrued by Company Employees pursuant to sick leave or under any short-term
disability policy of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be honored
until December 31, 2006, but may thereafter be reduced or eliminated at the
Parents discretion.

other legal restraint or prohibition, which prevents the consummation of the
Merger, or has the effect of making the acquisition of Common Shares in the

terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
prevent the entry of and to remove or lift such order, decree or ruling;

transaction constituting a Takeover Proposal is entered  



 

-44-  into which is subsequently consummated, the Company shall, prior to or
simultaneously with the consummation of such transaction, pay Parent the
Termination Fee; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company
be obligated to pay more than one Termination Fee and Expense Fee pursuant to
this Section 8.3.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.3(b)
to Section 8.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amounts due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and Section 8.3(c), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for any of the amounts payable to Parent pursuant to
Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the amounts so payable at the
rate on six (6)-month United States Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made pursuant to this
Agreement.

(e) The prevailing party in any legal action undertaken to enforce
this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be entitled to recover from the
other party the costs and expenses (including attorneys and expert witness
fees) incurred in connection with such action.

SECTION 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), this Agreement may be
amended by the Company, Parent and the Purchaser at any time before or after
any approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company but, after
any such approval, no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger Price
or which adversely affects the rights of the Companys stockholders
hereunder without the approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all the
parties.

SECTION 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), at any time prior
to the Effective Time, Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, may (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (ii) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained herein of the other or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by the other or
(iii) waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or conditions.
Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

(ii) shall be deemed to limit Parents obligations under Section 6.4(d) of

Common Shares, any of the following events shall occur:

(a) there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation,
legislation, interpretation, judgment, order or injunction enacted,

legislative body, court, government or governmental, administrative or
regulatory authority or agency, domestic or foreign, other than the
application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer or
to the Merger, that would reasonably be expected to, directly or indirectly:
(i) make illegal or otherwise prohibit or materially delay consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or make materially more costly the making of the Offer,
(ii) prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Parent or the
Purchaser of all or any portion of the business or assets of the Company or
any of their respective subsidiaries or compel Parent or the Purchaser or
any of their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separately all or

material limitation on the ability of Parent or the Purchaser to conduct its
business or own such assets, (iii) impose material limitations on the ability
of Parent or the Purchaser effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full

materiality or Material Adverse Effect on the Company, shall not be true and
correct, as if such representations and warranties were made at the time of
such determination (except as to any such representation or warranty which
speaks as of a specific date, which must be untrue or incorrect as of such
specific date) except where the failure to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (i) have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (ii) materially increase the cost of
the Offer to the Purchaser, or (iii) have a material adverse effect on the
benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

(g) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect or to

covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement.

The foregoing conditions (including those set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and

Purchaser and may be asserted by Parent or the Purchaser regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent
or the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their reasonable discretion, in each case, subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The failure by Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any
of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed, except that the term
"Merger Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which this
Annex I is appended.
