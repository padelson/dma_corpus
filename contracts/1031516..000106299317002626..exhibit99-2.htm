and any other documents relevant to a financing contemplated in this Section
4.5, including to cause the lenders and the other Persons committed to fund the
Financing or other financing contemplated in this Section 4.5 to fund the
applicable financing at the Closing. The Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate and enter into definitive credit or loan or
other agreements and all other documentation with respect to the Financing (or
alternative financings) contemplated in this Section 4.5 as may be necessary for
the Purchaser to obtain such funds, on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Financing Documents or on other terms and conditions acceptable to the
Purchaser that would not be reasonably expected to result in any of the
circumstances described in clauses (I) to (IV) above, as soon as reasonably
practicable but in any event prior to the Closing. The Purchaser will deliver to
the Company true, correct and complete copies of any executed definitive
documents and documentation entered into in connection with the Financing or any
alternative financing contemplated by this Section 4.5 promptly when available
and drafts thereof from time to time upon the reasonable request of the Company.
The Purchaser will keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the Financing or any alternative financing
contemplated by this Section 4.5 and will give the Company prompt notice of any
material change in or with respect to the Financing or alternative financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall give the
Company prompt (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notice (w) if any
Financing Document or alternative financing commitment referred to in this
Section 4.5 will expire or be terminated for any reason, (x) of any event that,
without or without notice, lapse of time or both, would individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a breach or default by any party to any of the Financing
Documents or any definitive agreements referred to in this Section 4.5 or of
which the Purchaser becomes aware, (y) if the Purchaser has any reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or
condition of any funding referred to in this Section 4.5 to be satisfied by it
that would reasonably be expect to impair the ability of the Purchaser to
consummate the Financing (or alternative financing, as applicable), or (z) of
the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other communication, in each case
with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Documents or any material
provisions of the Financing Documents or a request for amendments or waivers
thereto that are or would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the timely
completion of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or (2) intention by any party to the Financing Documents to no longer provide or
underwrite the Financing or alternative financing referred to in this Section
4.5 on the terms set forth in the applicable Financing Document, or (3) dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the Financing Documents
with respect to the obligation to fund a financing referred to in this Section
4.5 or the amount of such financing to be funded at Closing. Upon the occurrence
of any circumstance referred to in clauses (w) to (z) of the immediately
preceding sentence which would make any portion of the Financing unavailable,
and such portion is reasonably required to fund the consideration pursuant to
the Plan of Arrangement and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to
be paid by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative
committed financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, together
with cash held by the Purchaser as demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Company, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
on a basis that is not subject to conditions precedent that are materially less
favourable taken as a whole than the terms set forth in the applicable Financing
Documents, and otherwise on terms and conditions not materially less favourable.
The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser obtaining financing is
not a condition to any of its obligations hereunder, regardless of the reasons
why Financing is not obtained or whether such reasons are within or beyond the
control of the Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, if any financing
      referred to in this Section 4.5 is not obtained, the Purchaser will
      continue to be obligated to consummate the Arrangement, subject to and in
      the terms contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser will use
      reasonable best efforts to enter into hedging arrangements to hedge the
      Canadian dollars required to fund the consideration pursuant to the Plan
      of Arrangement and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be
      paid by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, as soon as reasonably
      practicable but in any event prior to the Closing, and shall provide the
      Company with evidence of such hedging arrangements that is reasonably
      satisfactory to the Company promptly following such arrangements being
      entered into. The Purchaser shall not permit Peter Stein and his Related
      Parties (as defined in the Financing Documents) (taken together) to cease
      to hold beneficially, directly or indirectly, issued share capital of the
      Purchaser having the right to cast more than 50% of the votes capable of

      contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements the
      Parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that the Termination Fee
      set out in Section 8.2 represent liquidated damages which are a genuine
      pre-estimate of the damages, including opportunity costs, which the
      Purchaser will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to
      such damages and resultant termination of this Agreement, and are not
      penalties. The Company irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise
      as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive.
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
      of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms in
      circumstances that constitute a Termination Fee Event, the payment of the

and the Arrangement, and to satisfy all other obligations payable by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and the Arrangement. The Purchaser delivered to the Company a complete and accurate copy of the facilities agreement and intercreditor
agreement, and any relevant fee letters (with only the fee and any other economic provisions redacted, none of which would permit the Lenders (as defined below) to reduce the amount or availability of the Financing except as permitted by Section
4.5) from the financial institutions (the &ldquo;<B>Lenders</B>&rdquo;) identified therein (the &ldquo;<B>Financing Documents</B>&rdquo;) pursuant to which such financial institutions have committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (being collectively referred to as the &ldquo;<B>Financing</B>&rdquo;). The Financing Documents
have not been amended or modified and the Lenders&rsquo; respective commitments contained in such letters and agreements have not been withdrawn, terminated, rescinded or reduced (except as permitted by Section 4.5) in any respect by the Purchaser
or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, the Lenders, as applicable. Assuming the Financing is funded pursuant to the Financing Documents, the net proceeds of the Financing, together with cash held by the Purchaser, will, in the aggregate be
sufficient to enable the Purchaser to fund the Aggregate Consideration and make all other payments of any fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the Arrangement and the Financing, and to pay amounts related to refinancing of any
outstanding indebtedness of the Company contemplated by the Financing Documents. Assuming accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company hereunder, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of the Purchaser under the Financing Documents or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, any other parties thereto, or a failure of any condition to the Financing or otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable on the Effective Date. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 of the Agreement, the Purchaser has no reason to expect that any of the
conditions of the Purchaser to the Financing will fail to timely be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available on the Effective Date. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Documents. The Purchaser or its affiliates have paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms the Financing Documents
on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or prior to the Effective Time. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements to which the Purchaser is a party which are related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Party agrees that a breach of this representation and
warranty will not result in the failure of a condition precedent hereunder, if (notwithstanding such breach) (i) the Purchaser is willing and able to consummate the Arrangement on the Effective Date, and (ii) has funds sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby at the Effective Time.</P>
