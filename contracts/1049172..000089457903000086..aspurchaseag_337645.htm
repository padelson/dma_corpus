deliver to Seller an allocation schedule setting forth Buyer\'s determination
of such allocation (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") within 120 days after the

provide Seller with reasonable access to the Books and Records, any other
related information, and to any Transferred Employees or other employees of
Buyer, and shall cooperate fully with Seller, to the extent necessary for
Seller to jointly prepare with Buyer the Coupon Liability Statement, and to

available to Buyer all books and records, work papers, personnel and other
materials and sources used by Seller or otherwise in its possession and which
may be relevant to the preparation of the Coupon Liability Statement by Buyer
and Seller and shall cooperate fully with Buyer to the extent necessary for
Buyer to jointly prepare with Seller the Coupon Liability Statement and to
jointly calculate with Seller the Actual Coupon Liability.

 

(b) If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon the calculation of the

controversy shall be referred for a final determination to Deloitte and Touche
LLP. Such accounting firm shall make a final determination as to all matters
remaining in dispute and the determination by such firm of the Actual Coupon
Liability shall be binding upon the parties, absent manifest error. The
parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of such firm. The parties

possession (or the possession of its Representatives) which may be requested
by Deloitte and Touche LLP in connection with the determination of the Actual
Coupon Liability.

 

(c) If the Actual Coupon Liability exceeds $1,000,000, Seller shall pay
Buyer an amount equal to the amount of the excess in immediately available
funds in accordance with the instructions of Buyer, together with interest
thereon for any day from and after the Coupon Settlement Date to and excluding
the date paid, at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate, within five (5)

promotion materials or (z) any other person or entity, regarding offers of

paid by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, under this _Section 2.10_ shall
be paid within ten (10) days of receipt by Seller or Buyer, as the case may

shall, except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or as consented
to by Buyer in writing, operate the Business in a manner consistent with its
ordinary course, use all reasonable efforts to preserve its properties,
business and relationships with suppliers and customers of the Business, and
will not take any action inconsistent with this Agreement or with the
consummation of the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Seller shall not, except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement or as

(b) enter into, extend, materially modify, terminate or renew any Contract,

aggregate are material to the Business, except in the ordinary course of

any inaccuracies therein. In addition, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, Seller shall update those portions of the schedules to the
Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement relating to the representations and
warranties contained in Article III therein to reflect changes thereto through
the Closing Date or otherwise to reflect any inaccuracies therein. Seller or
Buyer shall deliver any updated Disclosure Schedules or schedules to the

Closing Date. The updating of the Disclosure Schedules in accordance with
this  _Section 6.5_ shall not limit Buyer\'s rights under _Article X_ with

delivered pursuant hereto and, for the avoidance of doubt, such rights, shall
be determined based on Seller\'s Disclosure Schedule as it exists on the date
hereof.

 

6.6 _Title Policies_. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other, in
such manner as may be necessary, including entry into such escrow or other
arrangements as shall be customary in each locality in which the Stoughton
Facility is located, to cause the Title Company to deliver to Buyer on the

policy of title insurance at standard rates insuring that Buyer, as of the

may be necessary to cause the Title Company to issue the Title Policy.

 

6.7 _Failure to Obtain Third Party Consents_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that the consent, approval or permission
of certain Governmental Authorities and other Persons may be required for the
sale, transfer or assignment by Seller to Buyer of certain Contracts, Permits
or other assets or the assumption by Buyer of certain Contracts (hereinafter
referred to as the " _Consents_ "). To the extent that any of the Contracts,
Permits, or other assets are not saleable, transferable or assignable without
the consent of a third party, neither this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
nor any of the instruments or documents executed and delivered in connection
herewith or therewith, shall constitute a sale, transfer or assignment thereof
if such sale, transfer or assignment or attempted sale, transfer or assignment
could constitute a breach, violation or default thereof or could result in the
termination of or accelerate the performance required by or result in the
right of termination or acceleration thereunder or could result in the
creation of an Encumbrance on any such Contract, Permit or other asset. Buyer
and Seller also agree that, although Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate with
each other in attempting to obtain all Consents, any failure to obtain any
Consent by either Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, for any reason
whatsoever shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by Seller or Buyer,
as the case may be.

 

(b) If one or more Consents are not obtained prior to or at Closing and the
Closing is consummated, unless Seller and Buyer otherwise agree in writing,
Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of twelve
(12) months after Closing to assist Buyer in obtaining any such Consent. In
addition, during the period after the Closing, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable
Regulations and to the extent reasonably within the contractual or other
ability or control of Seller, and provided Buyer reimburses Seller immediately
for the costs and liabilities under such

 



 

 _ **33  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

Contracts incurred by Seller, to enjoy the economic and other benefits of the
subject matter of the Contract, Permit or other asset as if such Consent had
been obtained. In furtherance of the foregoing, in the event that any
necessary Consent to the assignment of any contract manufacturing agreement
under which Products are ordered by Seller or Seller\'s Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Contract Manufacturing Agreements_ ") is not obtained
prior to the Closing Date or if Buyer is unable, prior to the Closing Date, to
put in place substitute agreements with the supplier of Products under the
Contract Manufacturing Agreement which are Excluded Contracts, on terms and
conditions which are satisfactory to Buyer, Seller shall for a period of not
less than six (6) months following the Closing Date (or such shorter period as
Buyer shall specify) continue to place orders for Products on behalf of the
Business on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Contract
Manufacturing Agreements. Buyer shall pay Seller or any applicable Seller
Affiliate for any amounts which are required to be paid by Seller or any
Seller Affiliate in respect of Products purchased in accordance with the
foregoing arrangements.

Permit or other asset retained at the Closing is obtained, Seller shall
promptly convey, transfer and assign such Contract, Permit or other asset and
Buyer shall assume such Contract, Permit or other asset and all related
Liabilities pursuant to a special-purpose conveyance document, containing
terms not materially different from the Ancillary Agreements. Buyer shall make
such Transferred Employees available to Seller as are necessary or convenient
to assist Seller in performing its obligations under _Section 6.7(b)_.

 

6.8 _Financing_. (a) Buyer shall use all reasonable best efforts to comply
with all covenants and to satisfy all conditions to funding of the Financing
described in the Commitment Letter to the extent within the control of Buyer
or its Affiliates. Buyer shall notify Seller promptly if it has any reasonable
basis for believing that the funding of the Financing described in the
Commitment Letter will be materially delayed or will not occur as contemplated
herein.

 

(b) Seller shall cooperate reasonably, and shall cause its officers and
employees to cooperate reasonably, in connection with Buyer\'s arrangements
for the Financing, including (i) preparing and making available such financial
information with respect to the Business as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer (provided that, subject to _Section 9.5_ , the foregoing shall not
require Seller to prepare financial information not customarily generated or
maintained by Seller or using account principles not customarily used by
Seller) and (ii) making available representatives and employees of Seller and
their accountants and attorneys, including for purposes of due diligence and
marketing efforts related to the Financing. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
Seller\'s reasonable out of pocket expenses, which are reasonably documented,
incurred to comply with this _Section 6.8(b)_.

 

6.9 _Exclusivity_. Seller has been in negotiations with other parties
concerning a possible sale of the Business and such other parties have
obtained certain information relating thereto. Seller agrees to immediately
terminate, and to cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to terminate, all existing negotiations or activities with any
party other than Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives,
and, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a) the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to  _Sections 11.1_ or _11.2_ and (b) the Closing,
(i) agrees not to, and cause their respective Affiliates, and its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, negotiate
or enter into other

 



 

 _ **34  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

substantive discussions with any party other than Buyer, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives relating to the sale of all or any part of
any of the Business and (ii) agrees not to provide this Agreement or any
financial or operating information relating to the Business to any party other
than (A) Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives and (B)
Seller\'s Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives. Buyer shall
be entitled to pursue any and all remedies to which it may be entitled at law
or in equity for violations of this  _Section 6.10_. Seller agrees that
Buyer will suffer irreparable damage in the event that any provision of this 
_Section 6.9_ is not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise is
breached. It is accordingly agreed that Buyer shall be entitled to the remedy
of specific performance of the terms of this  _Section 6.9_ and injunctive
relief preventing any breach of the terms of this  _Section 6.9_ by Seller.

 

6.10 _Co-Packing Agreement_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Li Destri to renew the co-packing agreement by and between Li
Destri and Seller on or prior to the Closing Date for a period of no less than
two (2) years on substantially the same terms and conditions as are in effect
on the date hereof. Seller hereby agrees to keep Buyer apprised of, and

with Li Destri over the renewal of such agreement.

effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer to hire all Employees in

(d) _Welfare Plans and Benefit Arrangements_.

 

(i) _Generally_. The Closing Date shall be the date of termination of
employment of each Transferred Employee under each Seller Welfare Plan and
each Seller Benefit Arrangement and shall be the date of cessation of
participation of each Covered Person under all Seller Welfare Plans and also
under all Seller Benefit Arrangements with respect to which no contrary
provisions are made in this _Section 9.3_. Except as set forth below, to the
extent that any such Seller Welfare Plans and Seller Benefit Arrangements have
incurred claims on or before the Closing Date which have not been paid by the
Closing Date, such incurred but unpaid claims shall be paid after the Closing
Date by Seller or its ERISA Affiliates. For purposes of this _Section 9.3(d)_
, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred: (a) in the case of a disability
plan, upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to the disability claim;
(b) in the case of a medical, prescription drug, dental or vision benefit
plan, upon an individual\'s receipt of professional services, equipment or
prescription drugs covered under such plan; (c) in the case of a life

dismemberment plan, upon the date of the accident.

 

(ii) _Retiree Medical_. Any Transferred Employee who as of the Closing Date
satisfies the age, service and other eligibility requirements for retiree
health coverage and retiree life insurance under any Seller Welfare Benefit
Plan shall be provided by Seller and/or its ERISA Affiliates with an
opportunity to elect to continue such retiree health coverage and retiree life
insurance under such plan as of the Closing Date, provided that such
Transferred Employee makes a timely election for such coverage or insurance
not later thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. Such coverage and insurance
shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the relevant Seller
Welfare Benefit Plans, including the rights of Seller and/or its ERISA
Affiliates to amend or terminate such plans. The cost of providing such
coverage shall be borne by Seller and/or its ERISA Affiliates. A Transferred
Employee who so elects retiree health coverage and retiree life insurance from
Seller shall not be required to elect or participate in any health coverage or
life insurance plan provided by Buyer.

 

(iii) _Buyer\'s Plans_. Immediately after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
extend the opportunity for coverage under its health plan to all Covered
Salaried Persons who were covered under a health plan of Seller immediately
prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer shall provide all such
Transferred Employees with coverage under plans and benefit

 



 

 _ **39  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

arrangements which are generally comparable to those which Buyer currently
provides to its similarly situated employees. All such coverages will be under
the same terms and conditions as generally apply to similarly situated
employees of Buyer. In addition, immediately after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall establish replacement programs for the Seller Welfare Benefit Plans and
Benefit Arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date for the
Covered Union Persons so that there is no interruption in their coverage, and
such replacement programs shall fully comply with the terms of any applicable
collective bargaining agreement. Buyer shall waive any "preexisting condition"
exclusion or "actively at work" requirement which would cause any of the
Covered Persons, or any existing medical condition of the Covered Persons, to
be excluded from its health plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this paragraph, with respect to health coverage for any Transferred Employee
on short-term disability, disability covered by workers compensation or
approved leave (and each other Covered Person related to such Transferred
Employee), Buyer shall extend the opportunity for coverage under its health
plan (and waive any "preexisting condition" exclusion or "activity at work"
requirement applicable thereto) on or before the date such Transferred
Employee is released for return to active work by his or her medical examiner
or such leave otherwise ends.

 

Buyer shall recognize all prior service of the Transferred Employees that
Seller recognized under its Welfare Benefit Plans, Pension Plans and Benefit
Arrangements for the purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate (but
not for purposes of benefit accrual or the determination of any benefit
amount) under Buyer\'s Welfare Benefit Plans, Pension Plans and Benefit
Arrangements for similar purposes. Buyer agrees to coordinate deductibles,
maximum benefit restrictions and "out-of-pocket" maximums so that (A)
Transferred Employees receive credit toward any deductibles under Buyer\'s
Welfare Plans for deductibles paid under Seller\'s Welfare Plans during the
coverage year in which the employment transfer occurs and (B) Transferred
Employees receive credit for eligible claims incurred under Seller\'s Welfare
Benefit Plans during the coverage year toward any "out-of-pocket" maximums
under Buyer\'s Welfare Benefit Plans. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer the information
needed for Buyer to comply with the preceding sentence, and shall otherwise
cooperate with Buyer in making such determinations.

 

Seller shall be responsible to provide to any eligible Covered Person any
health care continuation coverage required pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code under any Seller Welfare Plan. Buyer shall not provide any incentive or
inducement to any Covered Person to choose to be covered by the health care
continuation or retiree medical or life insurance provisions of Seller\'s
Welfare Plans, including but not limited to payment of any Covered Person\'s
premium for such health care continuation coverage or retiree medical or life
insurance for any Covered Person who elects to receive such coverage from
Seller\'s Welfare Plans, provided however, that Buyer may pay all or part of
the premium for such health care continuation coverage with respect to any
Transferred Employee who, as of Closing, is on short-term disability,
disability covered by workers compensation or approved leave, and may pay such
premium until the date such individual is released for return to active work
by his or her medical examiner or such leave otherwise ends. Buyer shall
recognize Transferred Employees\' vacation time, sick leave and paid time off
earned but unused prior to the Closing Date under Seller\'s relevant Welfare
Plans and Benefit Arrangements. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer the information needed
for Buyer to comply with the preceding sentence, and shall otherwise cooperate
with Buyer in

 



 

 _ **40  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

making such determinations. Buyer shall, until at least the six month
anniversary of the Closing Date, continue to permit earned but unused vacation
time, sick leave credits and paid time off to be utilized in the same manner
as permitted immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(e) _Severance Benefits_. Seller does not intend to treat the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any future steps which Buyer may take in
connection with the Business, as constituting events entitling any of the
Transferred Employees to severance under any arrangement of Seller. Buyer
agrees not to dispute such treatment or assert that it should be otherwise.
Any severance, termination or similar payments or obligations due to any
Transferred Employee which relate to the termination of any Transferred
Employee by Buyer on or after the Closing Date shall be the sole
responsibility of Buyer. Any severance, termination or similar payment or
obligations to any Employee or Former Employee who is not a Transferred
Employee shall be the sole responsibility of Seller.

 

(f) _Workers\' Compensation_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section
9.3(d)_ , on and after the Closing Date (i) Seller shall be responsible for
paying, or arranging for insurance (including appropriate self-insurance) to
pay, all workers\' compensation claims of Transferred Employees which have
been incurred (i.e., with a date of loss) prior to the Closing Date, and (ii)
Buyer shall be responsible for paying, or arranging for insurance (including
appropriate self-insurance) to pay, all workers\' compensation claims of
Transferred Employees which are incurred (i.e., with a loss date) on or after
the Closing Date.

 

9.4 _Availability of Records_. (a) After the Closing, Buyer shall make
available to Seller and, as reasonably requested by Seller, to its agents and
representatives, any taxing authority, or any other Governmental Authority, in
each case, to the extent necessary for reasonable business purposes, and upon
reasonable advance notice, all information, records and documents relating to
the Business and the Transferred Employee for periods prior to Closing and
shall preserve all such information, records and documents until six (6) years
after the Closing Date. Buyer shall also make available to Seller (so long as
the foregoing does not materially interrupt Buyer\'s business operations), as
reasonably requested by Seller personnel responsible for preparing or
maintaining information, records and documents, in connection with Tax
matters, governmental contracts, litigation or potential litigation, including
claims for workers\' compensation, product liability, general insurance
liability and automobile insurance liability. Prior to destroying any records
related to Seller for the period prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify
Seller thirty (30) days in advance of any such proposed destruction of its
intent to destroy such records, and Buyer will permit Seller to retain any
such records; _provided, however,_ that failure to provide such notification
shall not constitute a basis for any liability or claim for damages. Out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with this Section
9.4(a) shall be reimbursed by Seller. With respect to any litigation and
claims that are Excluded Liabilities, Buyer shall render all reasonable
assistance that Seller may request in defending such litigation or claim and
shall make available to Seller personnel most knowledgeable about the matter
in question.

 

(b) After the Closing, Seller shall make available to Buyer and, as
reasonably requested by Buyer, to its agents and representatives, any taxing
authority, or any other Governmental Authority, in each case to the extent
necessary for reasonable business purposes, at Buyer\'s expense and upon
reasonable request and notice, all information, records and

 



 

 _ **41  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

documents relating to the Business in Seller\'s possession for periods prior
to Closing, and shall preserve all such information, records and documents for
six (6) years after the Closing Date. Prior to destroying any records related
to the Business for the period prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall notify
Buyer thirty (30) days in advance of any such proposed destruction of its
intent to destroy such records, and Seller will permit Buyer to retain any
such records; _provided, however,_ that failure to provide such notification
shall not constitute a basis for any liability or claim for damages. Out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection with this Section
9.4(b) shall be reimbursed by Buyer.

 

9.5 _Financial Information Cooperation_. From and after the date hereof,
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation, review and audit of
financial statements and other financial information regarding the Business
that is required to be included in the financial reports and other public
disclosures of Guarantor pursuant to Regulations S-X and S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby. Such
cooperation shall include the execution and delivery of a customary
representation letter to the accounting firm responsible for reviewing and
auditing such financial statements. The accounting firm responsible for the
review and audit of such financial statements shall be selected by Buyer. All
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, review and
audit of such information shall be paid by Buyer.

 

ARTICLE X 
  
  _ SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION_

 

10.1 _Survival of Representations, Etc_. The representations and warranties
of Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date
but shall terminate twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date except that
(a) the representations and warranties in Sections 4.16 shall survive until
the date which is sixty (60) days after the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to such matters, (b) the representations and warranties
set forth in  _Section 4.17_ shall survive until the date which is thirty-six
(36) months after the Closing Date, (c) the representations and warranties set
forth in the second sentence of Section 4.7(a) shall survive until the date
which is sixty (60) months after the Closing Date and (d) the representations
and warranties in  _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.14_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ and _5.6_
shall survive the Closing Date in perpetuity; provided, that the foregoing
time limitations shall not apply to any claim for breach of representation or
warranty which has been made in writing in accordance with the following
sentence prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period. No claim
may be made with respect to any alleged breach of a representation or warranty
of Seller or Buyer contained in this Agreement, whether for indemnification in
respect thereof or otherwise, unless written notice of such claim setting
forth the alleged breach and resulting claimed damages in reasonable detail is
given to Seller or Buyer, as applicable, within the time period specified in
this  _Section 10.1_. No right to indemnification in respect of any breach of
representation or warranty shall be limited by reason of any investigation or
audit conducted before or after the Closing or by the knowledge of any party
of any breach of a representation or warranty by the other party either before
or after the Closing.

 



 

 _ **42  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

10.2 _Indemnifications_.

 

(a) _By Seller_. Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, and hold each of them harmless from and against
any and all Damages incurred by any of them in connection with, arising out
of, or resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by
Seller in this Agreement; (ii) any failure by Seller to perform any agreement,
covenant or obligation of Seller pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) Liabilities
to the extent resulting from the operation of the Business by Seller or any
Seller Affiliate prior to the Closing Date, other than the Assumed
Liabilities, (iv) the Retained Environmental Liabilities and (v) the Excluded
Liabilities; _provided, however,_ in each case, that Damages shall not
include, and Seller shall not be liable for, any Damages arising out of any
condition which resulted in an adjustment reflected in the Final Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_.

 

(b) _By Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives, and hold each of them harmless from and
against any and all Damages incurred by any of them in connection with,
arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement, (ii) any failure
by Buyer to perform any agreement, covenant or obligation of Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement, and (iii) the Assumed Liabilities, or (iv) any Liabilities
resulting from Buyer\'s operation of the Business from or after the Closing.

 

10.3 _Notice of Claims_. If a claim for Damages (a " _Claim_ ") is proposed
to be made by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against the party from whom indemnification is claimed
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), the  _Indemnified_ Party shall give written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable
after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event
which may give rise to Damages for which indemnification may be sought under
_Section 10.2_. If any Action is commenced against any party entitled to the
benefit of indemnity hereunder, written notice thereof shall be given to the
Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten
(10) business days after the service of the citation or summons). The failure
of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect
rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. A Claim Notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Claim, including an estimate
of the amount of Damages that have been or may be suffered or incurred by the
Indemnified Party attributable to such Claim, and the basis of the Indemnified
Party\'s request for indemnification under this Agreement.

 

10.4 _Assumption of Defense of Third Party Claims_. After receipt of a
Claim Notice with respect to a claim, demand or action initiated by a Person
which is not a party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, if it so elects, at its own cost, risk
and expense, (i) to take control of the defense and investigation of such
Third Party Claim and (ii) to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice to
handle and defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim within ten (10) business days after receipt
of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party
Claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect to the
Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Party\'s
cost and expense,

 



 

 _ **43  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim on behalf of
and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party; _provided, however,_
that such Third Party Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The party that assumes the defense of the
Claim, shall keep the other party reasonably informed of the progress of any
such defense, compromise or settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to conduct its own defense at the cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party establishes that
the conduct of its defense by the Indemnifying Party would reasonably be
likely to prejudice materially the Indemnified Party due to a conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or their
legal counsel; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in any event the Indemnified
Party may participate in such defense at its own expense.

 

10.5 _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. In the event that the Indemnified
Party settles any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have no further
indemnification obligations under _Section 10.2_ with respect to such Third
Party Claim; _provided, however,_ that if the Indemnifying Party refuses to
defend or otherwise handle such Third Party Claim and it is subsequently
determined that the Indemnifying Party is or was obligated to defend or
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, then
the Indemnifying Party shall remain obligated with respect to such settlement
amount. If the Indemnifying Party controls the defense of any such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of a Third Party Claim or ceasing to defend such
Third Party Claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or
cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief shall be imposed against the
Indemnified Party or if such settlement or cessation does not expressly and
unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim, without prejudice. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party proposes a settlement to any Third Party
Claim with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is or was entitled to
defend, which settlement is satisfactory to the party instituting such Third
Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party withholds its consent to such
settlement, and thereafter a final judgment is entered against the
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party pursuant to which Damages exceed the
amount of the proposed settlement, then in such case the Indemnifying Party
shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this
_Article X_ against and in respect of the amount by which the Damages
resulting from such final judgment exceed the amount of the proposed
settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a breach or
inaccuracy or alleged breach or inaccuracy in the representation of Seller
contained in the second sentence of  _Section 4.7(a)_ , prior to initiating
any Action to recover Damages with respect thereto from Seller, Buyer shall
fully exhaust all recourse or remedies available to it to collect Damages from
the Title Company under the Title Policy, and the amount of any such recovery
shall be applied to reduce any amount to which Buyer may be entitled to
recover from Seller with respect to such breach or inaccuracy; provided that
Buyer shall not be prevented from naming Seller as a defendant to protect
Buyer\'s rights under applicable law.

 

10.6 _Cooperation_. In the event that any Action relating hereto or to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is commenced, whether before or
after the Closing, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use reasonable
efforts to vigorously defend against and respond

 



 

 _ **44  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

thereto and make reasonably available to each other such personnel, witnesses,
books, records, documents or other information within its control that are
necessary or appropriate for such defense (except for trade secrets, documents
subject to any confidentiality agreement, attorney-client privilege or other
applicable privilege and such items which may not be made available pursuant
to a Court Order).

 

10.7 _Product and Warranty Liability_. The provisions of this _Article X_
shall cover, without limitation, all liabilities of any kind, nature or
description relating, directly or indirectly, to product liability, litigation
or claims against Buyer or Seller in connection with, arising out of, or
relating to Products.

 

10.8 _Limitations on Indemnity_ Payments.

 

(a) _Threshold_. Seller shall not be liable to Buyer under _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ and _(iii)_ , _Section 5.2(a)_ of the Intellectual Property
Purchase Agreement or in respect of any breach of any agreement, covenant or
obligation set forth in _Section 6.4_ for any Damages, unless and until (i)
the aggregate amount of all such Damages under this Agreement and the
Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement, otherwise due Buyer exceeds an
accumulated total of one percent (1%) of the Aggregate Consideration, and
thereafter the total amount of all such Damages actually incurred (excluding
the first one percent (1%) of the Aggregate Consideration) shall be
indemnifiable as and to the extent herein provided.

 

(b) _Maximum Indemnity_. Seller\'s aggregate liability under _Sections
10.2(a)(i)_ and _(iii)_ , _Section 7.2(a)_ of the Intellectual Property
Purchase Agreement, and in respect of any breach of agreement, covenant or
obligation set forth in _Section 6.4_ , for all claims for Damages incurred by
Buyer (and its Representatives and Affiliates) shall not in any event exceed
an accumulated total of twenty percent (20%) of the Aggregate Consideration.

 

(c) _Net Damages_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the amount of any Damages incurred or suffered by an Indemnified
Party shall be calculated after giving effect to (A) any proceeds, benefits or
recoveries obtained by the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) from
any other third party, including any proceeds from insurance policies covering
the event or claim giving rise to the indemnification obligation and (B) the
amount of any Tax Benefit to the Indemnified Party resulting from the event or
claim giving rise to the indemnification obligation. If any such proceeds,
benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnified Party (or any of its
Affiliates) with respect to any Damages after the Indemnified Party (or any
Affiliate) has received the benefit of any indemnification hereunder with
respect thereto, the Indemnified Party (or such Affiliate) shall pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such proceeds, benefits or recoveries, unless
such benefits were taken into account in calculating such Damages (up to the
amount of the Indemnifying Party\'s payment).

 

(d) _Payment Obligations Not Affected_. Nothing in this _Article X_ is

 _ **45  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

(e) _Certain Exclusions_. The limitations on indemnification obligations
set forth in _Sections 10.8(a)_ and _(b)_ shall not apply to breaches of
representations and warranties made in _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.14_ , or
the second sentence of _Section 4.7(a)_.

 

(f) _Calculation_. Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages
incurred arising out of or relating to any breach of a representation or
warranty in this Agreement (and not for purposes of determining whether a
breach thereof has occurred), any reference to "Material Adverse Effect" or
other materiality qualifications (or correlative terms), shall be disregarded.

 

10.9 _Tax Indemnifications_. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer, its Affiliates, successors and assigns, from and against any and all

10.10 _Exclusive Remedy; Disclaimer of Other Remedies_. Following the
Closing, the rights of Buyer under _Section 10.2_ shall be the exclusive
remedy of Buyer with respect to claims based upon a breach or alleged breach
of the representations, warranties and covenants of Seller contained in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or relating to the purchase and sale of
the Business and the Purchase Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except in the case of fraud, in
which case, the foregoing limitation shall not apply. Following the Closing,
the rights of Seller under _Section 10.2_ shall be the exclusive remedy of
Seller with respect to claims based upon a breach or alleged breach of the
representations, warranties and covenants of Buyer contained in this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements or relating to the purchase and sale of the

thereby. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Seller nor

contemplated by this Agreement, including with respect to any financial
information furnished to Buyer or its Representatives and which is not
included in the Disclosure Schedules. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, (i) the Purchased
Assets shall be transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement in their
present condition, "AS IS", with all faults, and without any warranty, express
or implied; and (ii) no patent or latent physical condition or defect in any

liability set forth in this _Article X_ are reasonable under the circumstances
existing as of the date hereof.

pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price to the maximum extent possible.

 

10.12 _Environmental Procedures_. With respect to Environmental Liabilities,
Seller shall have the right to direct, manage and control, and take such
actions as in Seller\'s reasonable judgment are necessary in connection with
any defense, Remedial Action, or other resolution of

 



 

 _ **46  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

any claim, event or condition which is a Retained Environmental Liability
subject to indemnification under this Agreement or which is a result of the
breach of any representation or warranty in _Section 4.17_ , if Seller is
responsible for more than fifty percent of the Liability under this Agreement.
Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate in good faith with respect to all Remedial
Actions. Buyer shall provide Seller with access to any property subject to the
indemnity reasonably necessary for Seller to perform the defense, Remedial
Action or other resolution provided that Seller shall have first notified
Buyer in advance of requiring such access. In addition to the foregoing,
Seller shall (A) expeditiously commence and use diligent efforts to complete
all Remedial Actions; (B) comply in all material respects with all applicable
laws (including, without limitation, Environmental Laws); (C) conduct the work
in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with Buyer\'s operation of
the Business or compromise the safety of those on the property; (D) use
environmental consultants and engineers reasonably acceptable to Buyer and
require such consultants and engineers to obtain and maintain liability
insurance, including contractor\'s pollution liability coverage, in the form
and at levels typically obtained and maintained for remediation projects and
naming Buyer as an additional insured; (E) provide Buyer with copies of any
workplans seven (7) days prior to submittal to any Governmental Authority, or
such shorter time as necessary to comply with Governmental Authority requests,
data generated in connection with any investigations, sampling or monitoring,
material correspondence with Governmental Authorities, and other material,
non-privileged documents relating to the workplans (and Buyer shall have a
right to consult with Seller and to review and comment on the workplans, and
Seller will consider and incorporate all reasonable comments of Buyer which
are timely provided); (F) provide Buyer with prior notice of and the right to
attend, as an observer but not a participant, meetings or material conference
calls with Governmental Authorities regarding the Remedial Action; and (G)
provide Buyer the right to approve (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) any activities which could reasonably be expected to
interfere with the operation of the Business. Seller shall perform the
Remedial Action to the minimum standards required under Environmental Laws or
by the Governmental Authority with lead oversight jurisdiction, as such
standards or requirements are in effect at the time of completion of any such
Remedial Action (the " _Remedial Action Standard_ "), and Seller shall obtain
(i) a full and unconditional release of liability (releasing Buyer) relating
to any Third Party Claim; and (ii) a "no further remedial action required"
letter or similar acknowledgement from a Governmental Authority or, if no such
letter or acknowledgement is routinely issued, a certification by Seller\'s
environmental consultant or engineer reasonably acceptable to Buyer that the
Remedial Action Standard has been achieved.

hereby or thereby, is contested in a formal judicial process, each party
hereby expressly waives any right to trial by jury of any such Action.

 

12.7 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. The Transaction Documents,
together with all exhibits and schedules thereto (including the Disclosure
Schedules), and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement
among the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the parties. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto. No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement
shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby.
No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar),
nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided. No failure on the part of any party to exercise or delay
in exercising any right hereunder shall be deemed a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise preclude any further or other exercise of such
or any other rights.

 

12.8 _Multiple Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which

contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement, certificate or
instrument referred to herein, shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, then to the maximum extent permitted
by law, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provision of this Agreement or any other such instrument.

 

12.12 _Public Statements_. Prior to the Closing, except as may be required by
applicable Regulations or the rules of any stock exchange, no public
announcement regarding the transactions contemplate hereby and the Transaction
Documents shall be made by either party or their Representatives or
Affiliates, without the prior agreement of the other party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer and Seller may prepare a mutually acceptable press
release or releases for dissemination upon the signing of this Agreement.
Following the Closing, except as may be required by applicable Regulations or
the rules of any stock exchange, or for customary disclosures to investors in
Buyer\'s parent entities, no public announcement regarding the transaction
contemplated hereby and the Transaction Documents (which announcement contains
any of the financial terms hereof or thereof) shall be made by either party or
their Representatives or Affiliates, without the prior agreement of the other
party, which agreement

 



 

 _ **52  CONFIDENTIAL**_

 

 

 

shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section 12.12_ shall prevent the parties from discussing the
transactions contemplated hereby with, or making disclosure to those Persons
whose approval or consent, as the case may be, is required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding any
confidentiality undertaking of the parties set forth in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, any party hereto (and each employee, agent or
representative of the foregoing) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure except to the extent
maintaining such confidentiality is necessary to comply with any applicable
federal or state securities laws. To the extent not inconsistent with the
immediately preceding sentence, this authorization does not extend to
disclosure of any other information, including, (a) the identities of
participants or potential participants in this transaction, (b) the existence
or status of any negotiations, or any other term or detail, or portion of any
documents or other materials, not related to the tax treatment or tax

the benefit only of the parties hereto, and no third party may seek to

directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners and Representatives of
Buyer and Seller are intended third party beneficiaries of _Section 10.2(a)_
and _10.2(b)_ , as applicable. Except for the Persons described in the
immediately preceding sentence, the parties specifically disavow any desire or
intention to create any third party beneficiary hereunder, and specifically
declare that no Person, except for the parties, and their respective
successors, shall have any right hereunder nor any right of enforcement
hereof.

 

12.14 _Representation of Counsel; Mutual Negotiation_. Each party has had the
opportunity to be represented by counsel of its choice in negotiating this
Agreement. This Agreement shall therefore be deemed to have been negotiated
and prepared at the joint request, direction, and construction of the parties,
at arm\'s-length, with the advice and participation of counsel, and will be
interpreted in accordance with its terms without favor to any party. The
parties\' respective counsel may not be disqualified from representing their
clients in indemnification or other disputes arising out of this transaction
by virtue of such counsel\'s prior representation of the other party in an
unrelated matter.

 

12.15 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer acknowledges that Seller will not comply
with the provisions of any bulk transfer or bulk sale laws of any jurisdiction
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from

a result of the failure to comply with any bulk sales or transfer laws with
respect to the Purchased Assets.

 

12.16 _Pre-Closing Performance_. Guarantor does hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantee the performance by Buyer of each and every
obligation of Buyer under this Agreement which is required to be performed on

shall be responsible for each and every representation and warranty made

 



 

 _ **53  CONFIDENTIAL**_
