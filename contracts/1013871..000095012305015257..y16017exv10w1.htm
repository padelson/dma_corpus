 2.2 _Purchase Price_. 

   

 (a) The aggregate purchase price for the Membership Interest (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall equal the sum of TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($205,000,000).

Buyer will determine a Purchase Price and a final allocation of that price among the assets of WCP Holdings and its subsidiaries pursuant to Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and related Treasury Regulations (the " _Final Allocation_ "). Buyer shall provide such final allocation in writing to Seller within 30 days after the Closing Date. The Seller shall, in good faith, have the right to object to the Final Allocation and any such objection shall be delivered to the Buyer in writing no more than 30 days after the Final Allocation is delivered to the Seller. If the Seller objects, the Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the objection. If the Seller and the Buyer cannot resolve such objection within 30 days, the objection shall be referred to Deloitte and Touche LLP (or if such firm is unwilling or unable to serve, another nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed on by the Buyer and the Seller for prompt resolution.) The decision of such accounting firm shall be binding on the Buyer and the Seller. The Final Allocation shall be amended to reflect the decision of 

   ##### 

  

   

such accounting firm or the results of any such negotiations. The cost and
fees incurred from the services provided by such accounting firm will be
split equally between Buyer and Seller. 

   

 (b) The Seller and the Buyer (i) shall be bound by the Final Allocation for purposes of determining any and all consequences with respect to federal, state and local taxes of the transactions contemplated herein (ii) shall prepare and file all tax returns to be filed with any taxing authority in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation and (iii) shall take no position inconsistent with the Final Allocation in any tax return, in any discussion with or proceeding before any taxing authority, or otherwise. In the event that the Final Allocation is disputed by any taxing authority and in the event that the applicable statute of limitations has not expired with respect to either the Seller or the Buyer, the Party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify and consult with the other Party hereto concerning resolution of such dispute, and no such dispute shall be finally settled or compromised without the mutual consent of the Seller and the Buyer, as applicable, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 (b) From and after the date of this Agreement, Dynegy, Seller, Buyer and NRG shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not include the payment of fees or the acceptance of materially adverse changes to such Specified Obligations) and

Specified Obligations to release each applicable Dynegy Party, from any and
all liability and performance obligations of any kind under the Specified
Obligations which accrue or arise on or after the Closing date, such releases
(the " _Counterparty Releases_ ") to be (i) duly executed by the applicable
counterparties in writing and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Dynegy, and (ii) with respect to release instruments delivered by any

agreement to be in writing and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Dynegy.

   ##### 

  

   

fifty percent (50%) of any and all claims and liabilities arising prior to the
Closing Date under such unreleased Specified Obligation, and (iv) be entitled
to all of the revenue and benefits arising from such unreleased Specified
Obligation, all as more particularly set forth in said Agency Services
Agreement. Nothing in clause (iii) above, however, shall be construed to
release DMT or DPM from any third party indemnification obligations they
may have under the Energy Management Agreements. 

   

 (e) To the extent a Dynegy Party has directly posted its own cash deposit or cash collateral with a counterparty to a Specified Obligation and such cash deposit or cash collateral has not been previously reimbursed to such Dynegy Party or replaced by Buyer, NRG or its designated Affiliate pursuant to this _Section 5.5_, at Closing (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the aggregate amount of any such cash deposit or cash collateral (inclusive of any interest earned thereon if applicable), less any portion thereof actually paid to such counterparty (or reimbursed to such Dynegy Party) by Buyer, NRG or its designated Affiliate and (ii) upon Sellers receipt of the amount(s) described in clause (i) above, Dynegy shall deliver to Buyer or Buyers designated Affiliate an assignment of all of such Dynegy Partys rights in and to such cash deposit or cash collateral (inclusive of any interest earned thereon if applicable) and an instruction letter to the applicable Counterparty notifying such counterparty of such assignment and irrevocably instructing such counterparty that any return of any such cash deposit or cash collateral shall be made to Buyer, NRG or its designee and not the Dynegy Party. 

   

 (f) Any security posted to Seller or Dynegy by a third party pursuant to any contract or arrangement with WCP or any of its subsidiaries, including but not limited to the items listed on _Schedule 5.5(f)_, shall be assigned to Buyer at Closing.

All rights and obligations of Buyer and NRG at and after Closing with respect to Specified Obligations as set forth in this Agreement shall apply to each Specified Obligation set forth on the revised _Schedule 5.5(a)_ to be provided to Buyer at Closing pursuant to this _Section 5.5(g)_, and such revised schedule shall be attached as _Exhibit A_ to the Agency Services Agreement to be executed at Closing.

final and non-appealable; 

 

 _provided, however,_ that (i) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant

such Party, at such time, is in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ shall not be
available to a Party if such Party, at such time, is in breach of any

If this Agreement is terminated under _Section 7.1_ of this Agreement:

SECTION 8. INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 8.1 _Seller s Indemnification Obligations_. From and after the Closing, the Seller and Dynegy agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless NRG, Buyer and its subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, members, managers, stockholders, Affiliates, employees, successors and assigns (the collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against and reimburse each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses, including such fees and expenses in any arbitration, mediation, litigation and on any appeal) (collectively referred to as " _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by and all claims, actions, suits, or demands made against a Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to: 

   

 (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller or Dynegy contained in this Agreement (including any of the related Disclosure Schedules thereto) 

   ##### 

  

   

or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Seller at the Closing
(but excluding any Ancillary Agreement); and 

   

 (b) any failure to perform any covenant of the Seller or Dynegy contained in this Agreement (but excluding any Ancillary Agreement). 

  

 8.2 _Buyer s Indemnification Obligations_. From and after the Closing, Buyer and NRG agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller, Dynegy and their respective officers, directors, members, managers, stockholders, Affiliates, employees, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against and reimburse each of the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all Losses suffered or incurred by, and all claims, actions, suits or demands made against a Seller Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to: 

   

 (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Buyer contained in this Agreement (including any of the related Disclosure Schedules thereto) or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Buyer or NRG at the Closing (but excluding any Ancillary Agreement); and 

   

 (b) any failure to perform any covenants of the Buyer or NRG contained in this Agreement (but excluding any Ancillary Agreement). 

  

 8.3 _Environmental Indemnification_. Without limiting the generality of the obligations of Buyer set forth in _Section 8.2_ above, Buyer and NRG agree, jointly and severally, to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against, and agree not to sue or join the Seller Indemnified Parties in any lawsuit or proceeding for, any and all claims, actions, suits, demands, liabilities (including, without limitation, strict liability arising under Environmental Laws), obligations, damages, judgments, awards, penalties, settlements, fines, losses, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees), of any kind or nature, directly or indirectly resulting from, relating to or arising out of the following and attributable to or arising from any event, condition, circumstance, activity, practice, incident, action or plan existing, commencing, or occurring at any time, whether prior to or after the closing, relating in any way to WCP Holdings, WCP, any Project Company or Project or any of their respective assets or Business Facilities (including without limitation the ownership, operation or use of any of the Business Facilities): 

   

 (a) Any actual or threatened violation of, liability under, non-compliance with, or environmental response obligation arising pursuant to, any Environmental Laws; 

   

 (b) Any liability, including, without limitation, strict liability, associated with the treatment, storage, disposal, or transportation for treatment, storage, or disposal, of Materials of Environmental Concern generated at any time by WCP Holdings, WCP, any of the Project Companies or the Projects or for which WCP Holdings, WCP or any of the Project Companies arranged at any time for treatment, storage or disposal; and 

   

 (c) The presence at any time of any Materials of Environmental Concern exceeding naturally-occurring concentrations on, in, under or affecting all or any portion of any of the Business Facilities of WCP Holdings, WCP, any Project Companies or 

   ##### 

  

   

Projects and any release or threatened release at any time with respect to
Materials of Environmental Concern. 

  

 The obligations of the Buyer and NRG hereunder are not contingent upon the assertion of a claim, directive, action or proceeding by a Governmental Authority or third party. Buyer and NRG shall be solely liable for all such environmental matters notwithstanding any Seller Indemnified Partys potential strict liability or alleged negligence. 

  

 8.4 _Tax Liability_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Buyer shall be under no duty or obligation to indemnify the Seller for any income tax liability due to the assignment, sale or transfer of the Membership Interests. 

  

 8.5 _Survival Periods_. The representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3_ and _Section 4_ shall survive the Closing for a period of two years; _provided, however_ , that the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1_ (Ownership of Membership Interests), _Section 3.2_ (Authority of Seller) and _Section 4.2_ (Authority of Buyer) shall survive the Closing indefinitely and claims asserted with respect to the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.11_ (Tax Matters) which claims may be made at any time before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. All other covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely. 

  

 8.6 _Limitations on Liability._  

   

 (a) Except with respect to the obligations of the parties pursuant to the Litigation Agreement, in no event shall Seller or Dynegy (determined on a combined basis) have any liability or obligation with respect to claims pursuant to _Section 8.1_ for any amounts in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price. 

   

 (b) Except with respect to the obligations of the parties pursuant to the Litigation Agreement, in no event shall Buyer or NRG (determined on a combined basis) have any liability or obligation with respect to claims pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or  _Section 8.3_ for any amounts in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price. 

   

 (c) No indemnifying Party shall have any obligation to indemnify a Party for special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, lost profits or similar items, except with respect to matters involving actions, claims or other proceedings brought or asserted by third parties and then only to the extent that an indemnified party (" _Indemnified Party_ ") is required to pay any such damages, lost profits or similar items to such third parties. Nothing in this Agreement or the Litigation Agreement is intended to require the payment by the Indemnitor of duplicative, in whole or in part, indemnity payments to an Indemnified Party. 

   

 (d) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided by an indemnifying Party (" _Indemnitor_ ") under _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ shall be net of (1) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party in excess of any associated cost to the Indemnified Party in obtaining such indemnification; (2) any 

   ##### 

  

   

insurance proceeds or other reimbursement received as an offset against such
Losses (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer or
third-party indemnitor); and (3) an amount equal to the net cash tax benefit
actually received attributable to such Losses. If the amount to be netted is
determined after payment by the Indemnitor of any amount, the Indemnified
Party shall repay to the Indemnitor, promptly after such determination, any
amount that the Indemnitor would not have had to pay pursuant to this
_Section 8.6_ had such determination been made at the time of payment. 

   

 (e) All indemnification payments made in accordance with this _Section 8_ will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except to the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in which case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify the relevant Party on an after-Tax basis (determined by reference to actual out-of-pocket Tax liability incurred by the relevant Party). 

   

 (f) Any claim for indemnification with respect to any of such matters identified in  _Section 8.5_ above which is not asserted by notice given as herein provided within such specified period of survival may not be pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived after such time. 

   

 (g) Except claims made pursuant to the Litigation Agreement for which there shall be no De Minimus Amount, no Party shall be required to pay or be liable for any Losses with respect to an individual claim (which individual claim shall include claims arising out of the same or substantially related circumstances) under _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ unless and until the Losses for such claim exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the " _De Minimis Amount_ "). 

   

 (h) Except claims made pursuant to the Litigation Agreement for which there shall be no Deductible, no Party shall be required to pay or be liable with respect to any claim for indemnification under _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses to Buyers Indemnified Persons based upon, attributable to or resulting from these indemnities of Sellers exceed, in the aggregate, Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), disregarding any individual claim (which individual claim shall include claims arising out of the same or substantially related circumstances) that does not exceed the De Minimis Amount applicable pursuant to _Section 8.6(g)_ and then only to the extent that such Losses exceed the Deductible. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 

   

 (i) An Indemnified Party shall have no right against an Indemnitor with respect to a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant if, at the time of Closing, the Indemnified Party has Knowledge of any such breach of representation, warranty or covenant. In the event any Indemnitor raises the exclusion set forth in the previous sentence as an affirmative defense to a claim for indemnification by an Indemnified Party with respect to any such breach, and such defense is not successful, the Indemnitor shall promptly pay the Indemnified Party the reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees and other disbursements directly incurred by such Indemnified Party to overcome such defense. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) It shall not be considered a breach of the representations or warranties set forth in _Section 3.11_ to the extent that any such breach occurred as a result of any inaccuracy of or omission in information provided to Seller or its Affiliates, or failure to provide information, by Buyer, NRG or any of their respective Affiliates for use in the preparation of the Tax Returns. 

   

 (iii) It shall not be considered a breach of the representations or warranties set forth in _Section 3.12_ to the extent that such breach occurred as a result of any inaccuracy of or omission in information provided to Seller or its Affiliates, or failure to provide information, by Buyer, NRG or any of their respective Affiliates for use in the preparation of the Financial Statements. 

  

 8.7 _Procedure for Indemnification Claims._  

   

 (a) Third Party Claims. 

   

 (i) Each Party shall, with reasonable promptness after obtaining knowledge thereof, provide the other Party or parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this _Section 8_ with written notice of all third party actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or assessments that may be subject to the indemnification provisions of this _Section 8_, (collectively, " _Third Party Claims_ "), which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the basis for the claim, a good faith estimate of the amount of Losses claimed by the third party and copies of any pleadings or demands from the third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that such notice is in any event given within the survival periods stated in _Section 8.5_, the failure to provide such notice reasonably promptly shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this _Section 8_, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure, and shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party otherwise than under this _Section 8_. 

   

 (ii) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this _Section 8_ and, if so, whether the Indemnitor elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) and at its sole risk and expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if legal counsel to the Indemnified Party determines, in writing provided to Indemnitor, that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest which makes it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel (such counsel subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnitor), with the reasonable costs and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the Indemnitor. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) If within 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnitor in connection therewith including, without limitation, by making available to the Indemnitor all relevant information and the testimony of employees material to the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any obligation or duty on the Indemnified Party or include a finding or admission of any violation of applicable law on the part of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor is diligently and in good faith contesting the Third Party Claim (1) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of, but not conduct or control, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel and advisors chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense, and (2) the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim at any time without the consent of the Indemnitor, provided that the terms and conditions of such settlement involve solely the payment of money damages and the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnitor. 

   

 (iv) If the potential Indemnitor does not provide the notice described in  _Section 8.7(a)(ii)_ within the 30-day period required thereby or if the potential Indemnitor fails to either contest or undertake settlement negotiations in connection with the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or reach a compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified Partys settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in any respect inadequate or unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in _Section 8.7(a)(ii)_ within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide notice within the 30-day period. 

   

 (b) Non Third Party Claims. 

   

 (i) Each Party shall deliver to the other Party or parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this _Section 8_ written notice of any claims for indemnification under this _Section 8_, other than Third Party Claims, which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the 

   ##### 

  

   

basis for the claim, and a good faith estimate of the actual or
future potential amount of Losses. 

   

 (ii) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this _Section 8_ (a " _Response Notice_ "). If the potential Indemnitor does not provide a Response Notice to the Indemnified Party within the required 30-day period, the Indemnitor shall be deemed to accept liability for all Losses described in the claim notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide a Response Notice within such 30-day time period the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such claim to an officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the potential Indemnitor does provide a Response Notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide such notice within the 30-day period. 

  

 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. A Partys right to indemnification provided in this _Section 8_ or in the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable, is the sole and exclusive remedy of that Party from and after the Closing with respect to any Losses arising out of or relating to the negotiation, execution, delivery, performance or non-performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (as applicable) or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided, however,_  that nothing in this _Section 8.8_ shall restrict or prohibit any Party from bringing any action (i) for injunctive relief or specific performance to the extent legally available, (ii) in the event of fraud by a Party or (iii) to enforce the rights and obligations set forth in the Ancillary Agreements. Each Party waives any provision of applicable Law to the extent it would initiate, limit or restrict the agreement in this _Section 8.8_. 

  

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS 

   

 9.1 _Costs and Expenses_. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Party shall pay be responsible for and pay its own costs and expenses associated with the performance of, and compliance with, all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with, including, without limitation, fees, expenses and disbursements of its attorneys, accountants and experts.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Providers shall provide or cause to be provided to Project Company the fuel management and power marketing and other transition services described on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the " _Transition Services_ "), it being understood that DMT shall provide all fuel related services and DPM shall provide all power related services. NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies agree that the Providers are providing Services hereunder only as an accommodation to NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies in connection with the Closing under the Purchase Agreement and with the understanding that the Transition Services 

   ##### 

  

 

are provided only in an effort to facilitate a smooth transition of the
performance of all fuel management, power marketing and administration
responsibilities by NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies or their
designees. In that regard, to the extent not completed on or before
the Effective Date, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date and in no
event later than the thirtieth (30th) day prior to the last day of the Term,
the Parties will take all actions necessary to terminate the designation of
DPM as scheduling coordinator for the Projects with the
California Independent System Operator (the " _ISO_ ") and, if applicable,
any designation of DMT as the Project Companies agent for fuel nominations.
The necessary actions include the following: (i) the Project Companies
submitting to the ISO a designation of a new scheduling coordinator for
the applicable Projects to replace DPM as scheduling coordinator as of a
mutually agreed date which shall in no event be later than the last day of
the Term; (ii) NRG or NRG West Coast submitting or causing the Project
Companies or their designee to submit, as appropriate, a letter to the
ISO accepting the designation as of such date; and (iii) DPM submitting a
letter to the ISO resigning as scheduling coordinator for the Projects as of
such date. NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies bear sole
responsibility for locating, selecting, and reaching agreement about terms
with the replacing scheduling coordinator. 

   

 Section 3.2 _Commercial Decisions and Responsibilities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the description of the Transition Services attached hereto as Exhibit A, Providers will provide the Services at the commercial direction of NRG (or NRG West Coast) and NRG (or NRG West Coast) shall be responsible for making all commercial and operating decisions related to the Services and Projects including, but not limited to, fuel scheduling and procurement and power sales and dispatch by the Projects. NRG (or NRG West Coast) will provide Providers with a weekly operating schedule that reflects expected operating conditions and requirements. In providing the Services, the Providers shall not be required to advance funds or provide credit support on behalf of NRG, NRG West Coast or any Project Company. The Providers shall not be responsible or liable for any power or fuel purchase and sale transactions or for any penalty, cost, charge, cash-out costs, imbalance charges or other fees or charges assessed under any fuel transportation agreement, fuel or power interconnection agreements or fuel or power related tariffs including those of any fuel transporter and of the ISO. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Party will be required to take any action that would impair the authority of any Party to sell power at market based rates as may be afforded to such Party by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Section 205 of the Federal Power Act. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Additional Transition Services._ Project Company may from time to time during the Term request services from either Provider in addition to the Transition Services (the " _Additional Transition Services_ "), whereupon the applicable Provider (i.e., DPM for power related services and DMT for fuel related services) shall notify Project Company whether such Provider is willing to provide such Additional Transition Services, the terms on which such Provider is willing to provide such Additional Transition Services and the additional consideration that would be payable to such Provider for providing such Additional Transition Services. 

  

 Section 3.4 _Termination of a Service._ NRG shall have the option to terminate the Services in full with respect to any Project Company. NRG may exercise such option by delivering written notice thereof to Provider not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the end of any 

   ##### 

  

    

calendar month. With respect to each Project Company identified in such a
notice the Services shall terminate as of the last Business Day of such
calendar month. The Providers shall be released of any obligation and
requirement to provide any such terminated Service as of such termination
date and NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies shall be released of
any obligation to compensate the Providers for such terminated Service for
any period after such termination date. 

  

 Section 3.5 _Knowledge Sharing_. While providing the Services hereunder the Providers shall cause their then current personnel who have been materially involved in providing fuel management and power marketing for the Projects to be reasonably available to NRG personnel and to communicate with NRG personnel regarding their past fuel management and power marketing experiences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Provider nor any of its Representatives or personnel shall be obligated to disclose information that is proprietary to Provider or its Affiliates or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable law or order or any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement to which either Provider or any of its Affiliates is a party. 

  

 Section 3.6 _Standard of Performance_. The Providers agree to provide the Transition Services in accordance with the standards of performance, care and level of detail they have historically provided pursuant to the Energy Management Agreements and to promptly correct any errors or omissions in their performance of the Services of which they are notified in writing by NRG or NRG West Coast. NRG, NRG West Coast and each Project Company acknowledge that the Providers are not in the business of providing services similar to the Services to third parties and that the Providers are providing the Services only as an accommodation to NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies to assist NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies in their assumption as of the Effective Date of responsibility for the management of fuel and marketing of power from the Projects and the administration of the Project Companies. ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVIDERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR THE RESULTS OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER AND HEREBY DISCLAIM (ON THEIR OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES) ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO THEIR PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF ADEQUACY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO PROJECT COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH LIABILITY ARISES DIRECTLY FROM THE PROVIDERS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. 

  

 Section 3.7 _Preservation of Books and Records_. The Parties agree that each of them shall preserve and keep the records associated with the term of this Agreement held by them relating to WCP Holdings, WCP, the Project Companies or the Projects for the longer of (i) four years following the Closing Date and (ii) such longer period as required under applicable Law, and shall make such records and personnel available to the other as may be reasonably required by such Party in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings against or governmental investigations of a Party or in order to enable a Party to comply with or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and each other 

   ##### 

  

    

agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event
a Party wishes to destroy such records within four years after the Closing
Date, such Party shall first give 90 days prior written notice to the other,
and such other Party shall have the right at its option and expense, upon
prior written notice given to such Party within that 90-day period, to
take possession of the records. 

  

ARTICLE IV

If the Defaulting Party does not cure its default within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, or if the default is such that it cannot be cured within such period of time and the Defaulting Party does not promptly commence action within such ten (10) day period which is calculated to cure such default within twenty (20) days and thereafter diligently pursue such action to completion, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right, in addition to remedies it has at law or in equity (but subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement), to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Defaulting Party, without prejudice to any remedies at law or in equity (but subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement) which are available to the Non-Defaulting Party by reason of the Defaulting Partys default. Notwithstanding anything stated herein, a good faith dispute with respect to the payment of any amount claimed under Article V to be due hereunder, for so long as such dispute remains unresolved and contested in good faith, shall not be considered an Event of Default. 

  

 Section 4.3 _Survival of Obligations_. Expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not relieve the Providers or NRG, NRG West Coast or the Project Companies of any obligations accrued or accruing prior to such expiration or termination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Providers, NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies shall continue to be bound by _Sections 3.6_, _Article VII_, _Sections 8.1_ and  _8.3_ , and _Article IX_ with such provisions surviving the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

shall accrue on such unpaid amount at the Interest Rate from the date that
payment was due until the date the payment is received. If, during the Term,

Providers, remit to the Providers so that the Providers may pay, the amount

 DAMAGES AND INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 Section 7.1 _Indemnification by NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies_. NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Providers and the Providers Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Provider Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees), actions, suits, demands, assessments or judgments with respect to any claim by a third party arising out of or relating to Providers provision of the Services pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that neither NRG, NRG West Coast nor the Project Companies shall be required to indemnify any Provider Indemnified Party for any such claims resulting directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Provider Indemnified Party. 

  

 Section 7.2 _Indemnification by Provider_. Dynegy, DPM and DMT agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless NRG, NRG West Coast and each Project Company and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _NRG Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees), actions, suits, demands, assessments or judgments with respect to any claim by a third party to the extent arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Provider and relating to Providers provision of the Services pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Limitations_. 

  

 (a) No indemnifying Party shall have any obligation to indemnify a Party for special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, lost profits or similar items, except with respect to matters involving actions, claims or other proceedings brought or asserted by third parties and then only to the extent that an indemnified party (" _Indemnified Party_ ") is required to pay any such damages, lost profits or similar items to such third parties. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require the payment by the indemnifying Party of duplicative, in whole or in part, indemnity payments to an Indemnified Party. 

  

 (b) Any amount for which indemnification is provided by an indemnifying Party (" _Indemnitor_ ") under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ (a " _Loss_ ") shall be net of (1) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party in excess of any associated cost to the Indemnified Party in obtaining such indemnification; (2) any insurance proceeds or other reimbursement received as an offset against such Loss (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer or third-party indemnitor); and (3) an amount equal to the net cash tax benefit actually received attributable to such Loss. If the amount to be netted is determined after payment by the Indemnitor of any amount, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnitor, 

   ##### 

  

 

promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnitor would not
have had to pay pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ had such determination been
made at the time of payment. 

   

 Section 7.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) Each Party shall, with reasonable promptness after obtaining knowledge thereof, provide the other Party or Parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable with written notice of all third party actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or assessments that may be subject to the indemnification provisions of _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable (collectively, " _Third Party Claims_ "), which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the basis for the claim, a good faith estimate of the amounts or relief claimed by the third party and copies of any pleadings or demands from the third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to provide such notice reasonably promptly shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under  _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure, and shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party otherwise than under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable. 

  

 (b) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable, and, if so, whether the Indemnitor elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) and at its sole risk and expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if legal counsel to the Indemnified Party determines, in writing provided to Indemnitor, that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest which makes it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel (such counsel subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnitor), with the reasonable costs and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the Indemnitor. 

  

 (c) If within 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnitor in connection therewith including, without limitation, by making available to the Indemnitor all relevant information and the testimony of employees material to the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any obligation or duty on the Indemnified Party or include a finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law on the part of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor is diligently and in good faith contesting the Third Party Claim (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of, but not conduct or control, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel and advisors chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim at 

   ##### 

  

    

any time without the consent of the Indemnitor, provided that the terms and
conditions of such settlement involve solely the payment of money damages and
the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnification therefor by the
Indemnitor. 

  

 (d) If the potential Indemnitor does not provide the notice described in _Section 7.4(b)_ within the 30 day period required thereby or if the potential Indemnitor fails to either contest or undertake settlement negotiations in connection with the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or reach a compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified Partys settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in any respect inadequate or unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in _Section 7.4(c)_ within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide notice within the 30-day period. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Expiration of Claim and Release_. Except for claims for indemnification under  _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ and claims for payment for Services (collectively the " _Excluded Claims_ "), all claims for damages pursuant to this Agreement brought by any Party against any other Party, must be brought within ninety (90) days, but not less than the shortest period permissible under Applicable Law, after the expiration or termination of this Agreement (the " _Limitation Period_ "). Effective upon the expiration of the Limitation Period, each Party on its own behalf, on behalf of its Representatives, (the " _Releasing Party_ ") releases, waives and forever discharges the other Party, (the " _Released Party_ ") and such Partys Representatives, from any and all manners of actions, causes of action, suits, debts, sums of money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, invoices, covenants, contracts, controversies, judgments, obligations, agreements, promises, damages, costs, attorneys fees, interest, warranties, representations, claims and demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, which the Releasing Party or anyone claiming by, through or under it ever had or may in the future have against Released Party by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever relating to this Agreement, other than with respect to the Excluded Claims. The Parties understand and acknowledge that the facts in respect of which the release contained in this _Section 7.5_ is made may be other than or different from the facts now believed by such party to be true. The Parties accept and assume the risk that said facts, or any of them, may be different from the facts now believed by such party to be true. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement will remain in effect as fully, completely and legally binding, notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any additional or different facts. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Ca. Civ. Code Section 1542 Waiver_. The Parties hereby acknowledge that there is a risk that, subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, they may discover, incur or suffer from claims which were unknown or unanticipated at the time this Agreement was executed, including unknown or unanticipated claims which arise from, are based upon or are related to the issues and matters addressed herein which, if known on the date this Agreement was executed, may have materially affected their decision to execute this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that they are assuming the risk of such unanticipated claims and agree that this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement applies thereto. The Parties expressly waive the benefits of Section
1542 of the California Civil Code, which provides: 

   

A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor. 

 

Effective upon effectiveness of the terms of this Agreement, the Parties waive
and relinquish all rights and benefits which they have or may have under
Section 1542 or the law of any other state or jurisdiction to the same or
similar effect. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 
 RELATIONSHIP, FORCE MAJEURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY 

   

 Section 8.1 _Relationship of the Parties._ The Parties agree that the Providers are providing the Services to NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies as independent contractors.

If a Provider is affected by a Force Majeure Event such Provider will give notice to NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies as promptly as practicable of: (i) the nature and probable duration of the Force Majeure Event, and (ii) upon the termination of such Force Majeure Event. 

  

Section 8.3 _Confidentiality._  

   

 (A) Each Party agrees to hold in confidence, and to cause its Representatives to hold in confidence, in the same manner that such Party keeps its own confidential information of a similar nature, or with reasonable care, whichever standard is higher, any Confidential Information. " _Confidential Information_ " means any proprietary or confidential information received by a Party, its Representatives (collectively the " _Receiving Party_ "), from the other Party or any of its Representatives (collectively the " _Disclosing Party_ ") in connection with the Services or otherwise; _provided, however,_ that "Confidential Information" shall not include information that (i) is or generally becomes available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (ii) was known by, or in the possession of, the Receiving 

    ##### 

  

    

Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (iii) was or later is
developed independently by the Receiving Party without use of Confidential
Information; or (iv) becomes available to the Receiving Party from a third
party not in breach of any confidentiality obligation of the third party. In
the event that the Receiving Party is requested or required (by oral question
or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall notify
Disclosing Party promptly of the request or requirement so that
the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Section 8.3(A). If in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Receiving Party is, on
the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to
any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, the Receiving Party may
disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; _provided, however_ ,
that Receiving Party will use its reasonable efforts to obtain, at the
request of Disclosing Party, an order or other assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information
required to be disclosed as Disclosing Party designates. 

   

 (B) At the end of the Term, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed by the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party shall provide written confirmation of such destruction to the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that NRG, NRG West Coast and the Project Companies shall be entitled to retain and use Confidential Information received from Providers solely in connection with their ownership and operation of the Projects and without disclosure to any third party competitors of Providers. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for retrieving all Disclosed Confidential Information from its Representatives other than those Representatives who have entered into a confidentiality agreement directly with the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party that is required to return Disclosed Confidential Information under this Agreement shall be entitled to retain one copy of such Disclosed Confidential Information to the extent that such Party deems, in its reasonable discretion, necessary or advisable to comply with applicable laws. The Receiving Party shall be deemed to have destroyed any Disclosed Confidential Information that is provided by the Disclosing Party or maintained by the Receiving Party in electronic form if such information is deleted from local hard drives so long as no attempt is made to recover such information from servers or back up sources. 

   

 (C) In the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party of the terms of this _Section 8.3_, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without the posting of a bond if permitted by law, and the Receiving Party shall not plead in defense thereto that there would be an adequate remedy at law. Any such relief shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, money damages or any other legal or equitable remedy available to the Disclosing Party.

Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Agent is hereby appointed by the Dynegy Parties to act as their duly appointed and recognized representative to provide and perform, and Agent hereby agrees to provide and perform, on behalf and in the name of each applicable Dynegy Party, all of the Dynegy Parties obligations and responsibilities under the Continuing Obligations in accordance with their respective terms and conditions (collectively, the " _Services_ "). The Dynegy Parties hereby authorize Agent to take those actions Agent may reasonably deem necessary in the name of the Dynegy Parties in 

   ##### 

  

 

connection with the performance and administration of the Continuing
Obligations including, but not limited to, terminating any such Continuing
Obligation in accordance with the standards set forth in _Section 3.3_
hereof. 

   

 Section 3.2 _Economic Benefits and Liabilities._ From and after the Effective Date, the Dynegy Parties and Agent agree to take such actions, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, as may be necessary to permit Agent to receive the economic benefits and assume the liabilities under the Continuing Obligations without committing a breach of the terms thereof. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Standard of Performance_. Agent shall perform the Services in good faith, in a good and workmanlike manner, with due diligence and dispatch, and in full compliance with applicable law and the terms and conditions of the Continuing Obligations. Agent shall not extend, modify or amend any of the Continuing Obligations in any material respect without the prior written consent of the applicable Dynegy Party thereto. 

  

 Section 3.4 _Cooperation._  

  

 (A) Each Dynegy Party agrees to: (a) provide Agent with all reasonable assistance, cooperation and documentation that may be reasonably requested by Agent in the performance of the Services; (b) refrain from interfering with Agents performance of the Services and consult with Agent prior to taking any action which could be reasonably foreseen as conflicting with Agents performance hereunder; and (c) to the extent necessary to enable Agent to perform its obligations hereunder, notify the Obligation Counterparties of Agents status and authorization hereunder; and (d) maintain all governmental approvals required to be maintained by any Dynegy Party under any Continuing Obligation and to the extent necessary for Agents performance of the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, the Dynegy Parties further agree to provide any and all documentation that may be reasonably requested by Agent to confirm to any Obligation Counterparty the power and authority of Agent to act in the name, place and stead of the Dynegy Parties with respect to (i) cashing checks, receiving wire transfers or otherwise accepting payments from Obligation Counterparties, (b) calculating, collecting and remitting payments to Obligation Counterparties in accordance with the terms of the Continuing Obligations, (c) collecting and remitting applicable taxes to any applicable Governmental Authority, and making any required tax filings in connection therewith, and (d) prosecuting, defending or settling any claims or liabilities under or relating to any Continuing Obligation. 

   

 (B) Agent agrees to promptly provide to each applicable Dynegy Party any correspondence or notice received by Agent from any Obligation Counterparty with respect to any actual or claimed breach, default or event of default (however denominated) by Agent or any Dynegy Party under any Continuing Obligation. In addition, upon request by any Dynegy Party, Agent agrees to provide or make available to each applicable Dynegy Party (or their Representatives) all books and records relating to the performance of the Services by Agent, including, but not limited to, any and all communications and correspondence to or from any Obligation Counterparty with respect to any Continuing Obligation.

Dynegy Party agrees to provide or make available to Agent (or their
Representatives) all books and records relating to the performance of the
Services by Agent, including, but not limited to, any and all communications
and correspondence to or from any Obligation Counterparty with respect to
any Continuing Obligation. 

   

 Section 3.5 _Performance Assurance and Back-up Cash Collateral_. Agents obligation to perform the Dynegy Partys obligations under the Continuing Obligations includes the obligation to post performance assurance to the Obligation Counterparties. In the event the amount required to be posted and actually posted by Agent on a Dynegy Partys behalf to any Obligation Counterparty reflects the benefit of netting against the exposure of such Obligation Counterparty to a Dynegy Party with respect to transactions unrelated to WCP, the Project Companies or Projects, then Agent shall also post cash collateral to the applicable Dynegy Party in an amount equal to the difference between the total amount that would be required to be posted to such Obligation Counterparty in the absence of netting and the lesser amount actually posted by Agent to the Obligation Counterparty as a result of the netting benefit. In the event no amount is required to be posted by Agent on a Dynegy Partys behalf to any Obligation Counterparty as a result of the benefit of netting as described above, then Agent shall post cash collateral to the applicable Dynegy Party in an amount equal to the total amount that would be required to be posted to such Obligation Counterparty in the absence of netting. If the amount required to be posted on a Dynegy Partys behalf to any Obligation Counterparty is greater than the amount that would be required to be posted to such Obligation Counterparty in the absence of netting, the Dynegy Party shall be responsible for posting any such excess amount (and Agent agrees to promptly return any such excess amount posted by the Dynegy Party in the event any such excess amount is returned by the Obligation Counterparty to Agent and not to the Dynegy Party). Further, in the event any Obligation Counterparty refuses to release any Dynegy Party credit support notwithstanding the tender of cash collateral, a letter of credit or other non-cash performance assurance from Agent as contemplated above or for any reason, then Agent shall also provide to the applicable Dynegy Party on the Effective Date cash collateral in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the amount that would be required to be posted in the absence of netting (such amount and/or any cash collateral amounts required to be posted to the Dynegy Party in accordance with this _Section 3.5_, being herein referred to as the " _Back-Up Cash Collateral_ "). Until such time as the Continuing Obligation has been fully performed and discharged or a Counterparty Release has been provided by the applicable counterparty to the Dynegy Party and any and all non-cash credit support provided by the Dynegy Party has been released, such Dynegy Party shall have the right to immediately draw upon such Back-Up Collateral if Agent fails to timely and fully perform the Dynegy Partys obligations under such Continuing Obligation. 

  

ARTICLE IV

   ##### 

  

  

 (A) A Dynegy Party or Agent breaches any of its material obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 (B) If any representation or warranty of Dynegy or Agent set forth in Article VI hereof shall prove untrue in any material respect.

If a Party commits an Event of Default, the other Party (hereinafter the " _Non-Defaulting Party_ ") may give such Party in default (the " _Defaulting Party_ ") a written notice describing such default in reasonable detail and demanding that the Defaulting Party cure such default. If the Defaulting Party does not cure its default within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, or if the default is such that it cannot be cured within such period of time and the Defaulting Party does not promptly commence action within such ten (10) day period which is calculated to cure such default within twenty (20) days and thereafter diligently pursue such action to completion, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right, in addition to remedies it has at law or in equity (but subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement), to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Defaulting Party, without prejudice to any remedies at law or in equity (but subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement) which are available to the Non-Defaulting Party by reason of the Defaulting Partys default. 

  

ARTICLE V 
 FEES 

   

 Section 5.1 _Compensation._ In consideration of Agents performance of the Services, Agent shall be entitled to all proceeds recovered by either Agent or the Dynegy Party arising out of the Continuing Obligations.

ARTICLE VII 
 INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 Section 7.1 _Indemnification by Agent_. Agent agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Dynegy Parties and the Dynegy Parties Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Dynegy Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees), actions, suits, demands, assessments or judgments with respect to any claim by a third party arising out of or relating to Agents provision of the Services pursuant to this Agreement or any Event of Default hereunder by Agent and for fifty percent (50%) of any third party claims arising prior to the Effective Date with respect to any Continuing Obligation; provided, however, that Agent shall not be required to indemnify any Dynegy Indemnified Party for any such claims resulting directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Dynegy Indemnified Party. 

  

 Section 7.2 _Indemnification by Dynegy Parties_. Dynegy Parties agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Agent and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Agent Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees), actions, suits, demands, assessments or judgments with respect to any claim by a third party to the extent arising out of (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Dynegy Parties and relating to Agents provision of the Services pursuant to this Agreement or (b) any acts or omissions of any Dynegy Party that prevent Agent from performing the Services and Agents other obligations hereunder. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Limitations_. 

  

 (a) No indemnifying Party shall have any obligation to indemnify a Party for special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, lost profits or similar items, except with respect to matters involving actions, claims or other proceedings brought or asserted by third parties and then only to the extent that an indemnified party (" _Indemnified Party_ ") is required to pay any 

   ##### 

  

 

such damages, lost profits or similar items to such third parties. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to require the payment by the indemnifying Party
of duplicative, in whole or in part, indemnity payments to an Indemnified
Party. 

   

 (b) Any amount for which indemnification is provided by an indemnifying Party (" _Indemnitor_ ") under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ (a " _Loss_ ") shall be net of (1) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party in excess of any associated cost to the Indemnified Party in obtaining such indemnification; (2) any insurance proceeds or other reimbursement received as an offset against such Loss (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer or third-party indemnitor); and (3) an amount equal to the net cash tax benefit actually received attributable to such Loss. If the amount to be netted is determined after payment by the Indemnitor of any amount, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnitor, promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnitor would not have had to pay pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ had such determination been made at the time of payment. 

  

 Section 7.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) Each Party shall, with reasonable promptness after obtaining knowledge thereof, provide the other Party or Parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable with written notice of all third party actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or assessments that may be subject to the indemnification provisions of _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable (collectively, " _Third Party Claims_ "), which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the basis for the claim, a good faith estimate of the amounts or relief claimed by the third party and copies of any pleadings or demands from the third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to provide such notice reasonably promptly shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under  _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure, and shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party otherwise than under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable. 

  

 (b) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable, and, if so, whether the Indemnitor elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) and at its sole risk and expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if legal counsel to the Indemnified Party determines, in writing provided to Indemnitor, that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest which makes it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel (such counsel subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnitor), with the reasonable costs and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the Indemnitor. 

  

 (c) If within 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, 

   ##### 

  

 

the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnitor in
connection therewith including, without limitation, by making available to
the Indemnitor all relevant information and the testimony of employees
material to the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor
shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred in connection with such cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any obligation
or duty on the Indemnified Party or include a finding or admission of
any violation of applicable Law on the part of the Indemnified Party, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor is
diligently and in good faith contesting the Third Party Claim (i) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of, but not
conduct or control, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through
counsel and advisors chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense, and
(ii) the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any Third Party Claim at any time without the consent of
the Indemnitor, provided that the terms and conditions of such settlement
involve solely the payment of money damages and the Indemnified Party waives
any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnitor. 

   

 (d) If the potential Indemnitor does not provide the notice described in _Section 7.4(b)_ within the 30-day period required thereby or if the potential Indemnitor fails to either contest or undertake settlement negotiations in connection with the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or reach a compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified Partys settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in any respect inadequate or unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in _Section 7.4(c)_ within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide notice within the 30-day period. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 RELATIONSHIP AND CONFIDENTIALITY 

   

 Section 8.1 _Relationship of the Parties._ The Parties agree that Agent is providing the Services to the Dynegy Parties as an independent contractor. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, agency or other association or relationship. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Confidentiality._  

  

 (A) Each Party agrees to hold in confidence, and to cause its Representatives to hold in confidence, in the same manner that such Party keeps its own confidential information of a similar nature, or with reasonable care, whichever standard is higher, any Confidential Information. " _Confidential Information_ " means any proprietary or confidential information received by a Party, its Representatives (collectively the " _Receiving Party_ "), from the other Party 

    ##### 

  

    

or any of its Representatives (collectively the " _Disclosing Party_ ") in
connection with the Services or otherwise; _provided, however,_ that
"Confidential Information" shall not include information that (i) is or
generally becomes available to the public other than as a result of
a disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (ii) was known by, or in the
possession of, the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing
Party; (iii) was or later is developed independently by the Receiving Party
without use of Confidential Information; or (iv) becomes available to the
Receiving Party from a third party not in breach of any confidentiality
obligation of the third party. In the event that the Receiving Party is
requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Receiving Party shall notify Disclosing Party promptly of
the request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 8.2(A)_. If in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, Receiving Party is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable
for contempt, the Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information
to the tribunal; _provided, however_ , that Receiving Party will use
its reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request of Disclosing Party, an
order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as
Disclosing Party designates. 

   

 (B) At the end of the Term, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed by the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party shall provide written confirmation of such destruction to the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for retrieving all Disclosed Confidential Information from its Representatives other than those Representatives who have entered into a confidentiality agreement directly with the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party that is required to return Disclosed Confidential Information under this Agreement shall be entitled to retain one copy of such Disclosed Confidential Information to the extent that such Party deems, in its reasonable discretion, necessary or advisable to comply with applicable laws. The Receiving Party shall be deemed to have destroyed any Disclosed Confidential Information that is provided by the Disclosing Party or maintained by the Receiving Party in electronic form if such information is deleted from local hard drives so long as no attempt is made to recover such information from servers or back up sources. 

   

 (C) In the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party of the terms of this _Section 8.2_, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without the posting of a bond if permitted by law, and the Receiving Party shall not plead in defense thereto that there would be an adequate remedy at law. Any such relief shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, money damages or any other legal or equitable remedy available to the Disclosing Party.

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but any of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. In construing this Agreement, the word "including" and its derivatives means "including, but not limited to" and corresponding derivative expressions. 

  

 Section 9.9 _No Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time by the Parties to this Agreement, under an instrument in writing signed by each Party. If the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of request for services to be performed hereunder conflict, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail. 

  

 Section 9.10 _No Waiver_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any Party, and no course of dealing between the Parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right, power or remedy. No waiver by a Party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the Party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Applicable Law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision will be fully severable, this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

EXHIBIT E 

   

FORM OF TERMINATION AGREEMENT  

  

 This Termination Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), is executed and delivered as of the Effective Date (defined below) by and between NRG Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _NRG_ "), Dynegy Inc., an Illinois corporation (" _Dynegy_ "), Dynegy Power Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _DPC_ "), Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc., a Texas corporation (" _DPM_ "), Dynegy Marketing and Trade, a Colorado general partnership (" _DMT_ "), Dynegy Power Management Services, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _DPMS_ "), WCP (Generation) Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _WCP Holdings_ "), West Coast Power LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _WCP_ "), El Segundo Power, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _El Segundo_ "), El Segundo Power II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _El Segundo II_ "), Long Beach Generation LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Long Beach_ "), Cabrillo Power I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Cabrillo I_ "), and Cabrillo Power II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Cabrillo II_ "). El Segundo, El Segundo II, Long Beach, Cabrillo I, and Cabrillo II are each referred to herein individually as a " _Project Company_ " and collectively as the " _Project Companies_ ". NRG, DPC, DPM, DMT, DPMS, WCP Holdings, WCP, and each Project Company are sometimes referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ". 

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement dated December___, 2005, by and between NRG West Coast LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Buyer_ "), NRG, DPC II Inc. a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "), and Dynegy (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), Buyer agreed to purchase all of Sellers membership interest in WCP Holdings; 

  

 WHEREAS, WCP Holdings is the owner of 100% of the membership interests in WCP and WCP is the owner of 100% of the membership interests in the Project Companies; 

  

 WHEREAS, each Project Company, other than El Segundo II, owns a power generation facility located in the state of California (each a " _Project_ " and collectively the " _Projects_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, DPC, DPM, DMT and DPMS have entered into those certain agreements with WCP, each of the Project Companies, or NRG in connection with the Projects as described on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and made a part hereof (as amended, each a " _WCP Related Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _WCP Related Agreements_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Parties and their Affiliates may have entered into other agreements between them from time to time in connection with WCP Holdings, WCP, the Project Companies, the Projects and other development opportunities and efforts in California (the " _Other California Agreements_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, in connection with the Closing under the Purchase Agreement, the Parties hereto hereby desire to terminate each of the WCP Related Agreements and the Other California Agreements. 

   ##### 

  

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Defined Terms_. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement. " _Effective Date_ " means the date of Closing under the Purchase Agreement. 

  

 2. _Termination of Agreements_. The Parties agree that the WCP Related Agreements and the Other California Agreements, except the Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, are terminated effective as of the Effective Date and that from and after the Effective Date, no Party shall have any liabilities, rights, duties or obligations to the other Party under or in connection with any of the WCP Related Agreements or the Other California Agreements; provided, however, that termination of any WCP Related Agreement or Other California Agreements shall not release any of the Parties thereto from (a) any obligations to indemnify the other Party against any third party liability, to the extent such liability was accrued prior to the Effective Date or arises from any act or omission occurring prior to the Effective Date or (b) any other obligations that expressly survive termination by the terms of the WCP Related Agreement or Other California Agreements. Nothing in this _Section 2_, however, shall be construed as an exception to, or modification of, the Litigation Agreement, it being understood that the Litigation Agreement shall govern and control with respect to the subject matter thereof. 

  

 3. _Ca. Civ. Code Section 1542 Waiver_. The Parties hereby acknowledge that there is a risk that, subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, they may discover, incur or suffer from claims which were unknown or unanticipated at the time this Agreement was executed, including unknown or unanticipated claims which arise from, are based upon or are related to the issues and matters addressed herein which, if known on the date this Agreement was executed, may have materially affected their decision to execute this Agreement. The Parties each acknowledge that they are assuming the risk of such unanticipated claims and agree that this Agreement applies thereto. The Parties expressly waive the benefits of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which provides: 

   

A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor. 

 

Effective upon effectiveness of the terms of this Agreement, the Parties waive
and relinquish all rights and benefits which they have or may have under
Section 1542 or the law of any other state or jurisdiction to the same or
similar effect. 

   

 4. _Counterparts; Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument, and it shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. This Agreement shall be construed under and governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Each of the Parties submits to the jurisdiction of New York, New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and 

   ##### 

  

 

determined in any such court. Each Party also agrees not to bring any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court
or tribunal. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any such action or proceeding so brought. Each Party
agrees to frame any complaint brought in any such action or proceeding
to support federal court jurisdiction if grounds for federal jurisdiction
exist, and further agrees that any of the other Parties may require such
Party to dismiss any state law case where a federal court would have
jurisdiction over the subject matter. 

   

 5. _Rules of Construction_. In this Agreement, the word "include(s)" means "include(s), without limitation," and the word "including" means "including, but not limited to." When the context and construction so require, all words used in the singular shall be deemed to have been used in the plural and vice versa. All headings appearing in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing this Agreement. 

  

 6. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect to the extent permitted by law. In the event of any such determination, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement to fulfill as closely as possible the original intents and purposes hereof. To the extent permitted by law, the Parties hereby waive to the same extent any provision of law that renders any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect. 

  

 7. _Integration; Modifications_. This Agreement (a) integrates all the terms and conditions mentioned in or incidental to this Agreement, and (b) supersedes all prior negotiations and all prior oral or written representations, understandings, promises, commitments, and agreements between the Parties or any of their affiliates, except the Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, with respect to its subject matter. The Parties agree, each on behalf of itself and its affiliates, that no representation, understanding, promise, commitment or agreement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be enforceable against any Party or its affiliates unless it is contained in this Agreement. No term of this Agreement may be amended, waived, or otherwise modified except in a writing signed by both Parties. 

  

 8. _No Waiver_. Failure to insist on compliance with any term or provision contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or provision, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power contained in this Agreement at any one time or more times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any right or power at any other time or times. 

  

 9. _Further Actions_. Each of the Parties agrees to take any and all actions reasonably necessary in order to effectuate the intent, and to carry out the provisions, of this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

  

 1.2 _CDWR Litigation Indemnification by NRG_. Dynegy, on the one hand, and Buyer and NRG on the other hand, each intend, except as otherwise expressly provided below in _Section 1.2(i)_ , to be responsible for one-half of the costs and attorneys fees incurred in defending the Power Litigation and to be responsible for one-half of any Loss suffered or incurred by either Dynegy, NRG or any of their affiliates in connection with the CDWR Litigation. To effectuate this intention, Buyer and NRG agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (but subject to the limitations set forth herein), they shall be responsible for, and they shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, jointly and severally, Dynegy, its affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, partners, shareholders, members, employees, agents (including counsel, auditors, accountants, and advisors), successors, predecessors, and assigns (collectively, " _Dynegy Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of and shall reimburse the Dynegy Indemnified Parties for any Loss suffered or incurred with respect to, arising out of or resulting from the CDWR Litigation:

 (ii) for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by Buyer contained in this Agreement. 

  

 _Exhibit E_ attached hereto sets forth an illustration of the application of _Section 1.2(i)_ above. 

  

 1.3 _Joint Power Litigation Indemnification_. Dynegy, on the one hand, and Buyer and NRG on the other hand, each intend to be responsible for one-half of the costs and attorneys fees incurred in defending the Power Litigation and to be responsible for one-half of any Loss suffered or incurred by either Dynegy, NRG or any of their affiliates in connection with the Power Litigation. To effectuate this intention, Dynegy agrees that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (but subject to the limitations set forth herein), it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the NRG Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of and shall reimburse the amount of any Loss suffered or incurred by, and any Proceeding against, any of the NRG Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from the Power Litigation; 

   ##### 

  

    

provided, however, that (i) Buyer and NRG shall be jointly and severally
responsible for fifty percent (50%) of all such amounts and (ii) Dynegy shall
have no liability or responsibility in respect of any non-monetary Losses
suffered or incurred by any NRG Indemnified Party (including the WCP
Entities), including injunctive relief. Buyer and NRG each agree that, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law (but subject to the limitations
set forth herein), they shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, jointly
and severally, each of the Dynegy Indemnified Parties from, against and in
respect of and shall reimburse the amount of any Loss suffered or incurred

(b) Buyer and NRG shall have no liability or responsibility in respect of any
non-monetary Losses suffered or incurred by any Dynegy Indemnified Party,
including injunctive relief. 

  

 1.4 _Mitigation_. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to address any claims and to mitigate any liabilities, losses, or expense in the same manner as it would in the absence of the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2\. _Defense of Litigation_. 

  

 2.1 _Control of Litigation_. Dynegy shall have the exclusive right to manage, direct, and control the Gas Litigation and the Power Litigation, except to the extent NRG is a named party to the Power Litigation in which case NRG may participate in the defense of the Power Litigation in accordance with the terms of the Power Litigation Joint Defense Agreement. NRG shall have the exclusive right to manage, direct, and control the CDWR Litigation; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 4.2_ hereof, NRG shall not have the authority without the express prior written consent of the Dynegy Indemnified Parties, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to file any pleading, make any admission, accept any finding of fact or enter into any settlement regarding the CDWR Litigation which provides that the conduct or behavior of the Dynegy Indemnified Parties constitutes gross negligence, willful misconduct, intentional failure to perform a duty or reckless disregard of the consequences of such conduct or behavior. 

  

 2.2 _Lead Counsel_. Dynegy shall use as lead counsel Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (and NRG acknowledges the absence and waiver of any claim of conflict of interest regarding that law firm) or such other law firm as is reasonably acceptable to NRG with respect to each of the Proceedings that comprise the Gas Litigation and the Power Litigation. Buyer shall use as lead counsel Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (and Dynegy acknowledges the absence and waiver of any claim of conflict of interest regarding that law firm) or such other law firm as is reasonably acceptable to Dynegy with respect to each of the Proceedings that comprise the CDWR Litigation. 

  

 2.3 _Indemnified Party Counsel_. Without limiting the provisions of _Section 4.2_ herein, Dynegy acknowledges that (i) the law firm of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and Hampton LLP (" _SMR andH_") (Carlton Varner or such other partner as SMRandH shall designate) has been retained by NRG to represent its interests in the Gas Litigation, (ii) Dynegy has waived any claim of conflict of interest regarding SMRandH and such representation of NRG, and (iii) SMRandH does not represent Dynegy in the Gas Litigation. NRG acknowledges that SMRandH is not serving or 

   ##### 

  

    

authorized to serve as lead counsel or as co-counsel to Pillsbury Winthrop
Shaw Pittman LLP and does not represent the WCP Entities in the Gas
Litigation. 

  

 2.4 _Cooperation_. Without limiting the provisions of _Section 4.2_ herein, the Parties acknowledge that (i) the provisions of the September 2, 2003, Joint Defense Agreement (the " _Gas Litigation Joint Defense Agreement_ ") to which Dynegy and NRG are parties shall apply to communications between Dynegy and NRG and their respective counsel with respect to the Gas Litigation and (ii) the provisions of the August 21, 2003, Joint Defense Agreement (the " _Power Litigation Joint Defense Agreement_ ") to which Dynegy and NRG are parties shall apply to communications between Dynegy and NRG and their respective counsel with respect to the Power Litigation. The Parties agree to amend promptly Exhibit A to the Gas Litigation Joint Defense Agreement to include all of the lawsuits and proceedings listed on _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement, Exhibit A to the Power Litigation Joint Defense Agreement to include all of the lawsuits and proceedings listed on _Exhibit D_ to this Agreement, and if the exception in _Section 1.2(i)_ above becomes applicable, Dynegy and NRG will add such litigation to _Exhibit A_ of the Power Litigation Joint Defense Agreement. In the event of a conflict or an inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any of the above-referenced Joint Defense Agreements, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and control. 

  

 2.5 _Defense Costs_. Without limiting _Section 1.1_ above, the defense of the Proceedings that comprise the Gas Litigation shall be at the sole cost and expense of Dynegy, which shall not seek, directly or indirectly, to charge back any such costs or expenses to any of the NRG Indemnified Parties (including the WCP Entities), and Dynegy shall be solely responsible for all legal fees and expenses of the counsel controlling the Gas Litigation. Without limiting  _Section 1.2_ above, the defense of the Proceedings that comprise the CDWR Litigation shall be at the sole cost and expense of Buyer and NRG, neither of which shall seek, directly or indirectly, to charge back any such costs or expenses to any of the Dynegy Indemnified Parties, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for all fees and expenses of the counsel controlling the CDWR Litigation; provided, however, that if and to the extent that the exception in _Section 1.2(i)_ above applies to any Loss otherwise indemnified under _Section 1.2_, Dynegy shall reimburse Buyer for fifty percent (50%) of any such costs, fees and expenses relating to such Loss. As contemplated by _Section 1.3_ above, the cost and expense of the defense of the Proceedings that comprise the Power Litigation shall be shared equally by the Parties. 

  

 Section 3\. _Representations and Warranties_. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party as follows: 

   

 (a) This Agreement in all respects has been voluntarily and knowingly executed by such Party and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Party. 

   

 (b) Such Party has the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder. 

   

 (c) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Party are not prohibited by and do not violate or conflict with or require any consent or approval with respect to (i) such Partys organizational documents, (ii) any order, writ, injunction, decree or judgment of any Governmental Body, (iii) any material contract or 

   ##### 

  

    

agreement to which such Party is a party or by which it is bound, or (iv) any
law, rule or regulation applicable to such Party. 

   

 (d) Such Party has had an opportunity to seek and has sought independent legal advice from attorneys of its choice and other advice from such accountants and other professionals as it deems appropriate, in each case with respect to the advisability of executing this Agreement, and such Party has carefully read this Agreement and has made such investigation of the facts pertaining to this Agreement as it deems necessary. 

  

 Section 4. Limitations and Procedures. 

  

 4.1 Limitations on Liability. 

  

 (a) No Indemnitor shall have any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party for special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, lost profits or similar items, except with respect to matters involving actions, claims or other Proceedings brought or asserted by third parties and then only to the extent that an Indemnified Party is required to pay any such damages, lost profits or similar items to such third parties. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require the payment by the Indemnitor of duplicative, in whole or in part, indemnity payments to an Indemnified Party. 

   

 (b) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided by an Indemnitor shall be net of (1) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party in excess of any associated cost to the Indemnified Party in obtaining such indemnification; (2) any insurance proceeds or other reimbursement received as an offset against such Losses (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer or third-party indemnitor); and (3) an amount equal to the net cash tax benefit actually received attributable to such Losses. If the amount to be netted is determined after payment by the Indemnitor of any amount, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnitor, promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnitor would not have had to pay pursuant to this _Section 4.1_ had such determination been made at the time of payment. 

   

 4.2 _Procedure for Indemnification Claims_. 

  

 (a) Third Party Claims. 

    

 (i) Each Party shall, with reasonable promptness after obtaining knowledge thereof, provide the other Party or parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this _Section 4_ with written notice of all third party Proceedings that may be subject to the indemnification provisions of this Agreement (collectively, " _Third Party Claims_ "), which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the basis for the claim, a good faith estimate of the amount of Losses claimed by the third party and copies of any pleadings or demands from the third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to provide such notice reasonably promptly shall not release the Indemnitor from 

   ##### 

  

    

any of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that
the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure, and shall not
relieve the Indemnitor from any other obligation or liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party otherwise than under this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this _Section 4_ and, if so, whether the Indemnitor elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) and at its sole risk and expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim. 

   

 (iii) If within 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnitor in connection therewith, including by making available to the Indemnitor all relevant information and the testimony of employees material to the defense of the Third Party Claim including but not limited to the assistance and participation of Lynn Lednicky. The Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any material non-monetary obligation or duty on the Indemnified Party, or include a finding or admission of any violation of applicable law on the part of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor is diligently and in good faith contesting the Third Party Claim, (1) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of, but not conduct or control, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel and advisors chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense (subject to  _Section 1.3_ above), and (2) the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim at any time without the consent of the Indemnitor, provided that the terms and conditions of such settlement involve solely the payment of money damages and the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnitor. 

   

 (iv) If the potential Indemnitor does not provide the notice described in  _Section 4.2(a)(ii)_ above within the 30-day period required thereby or if the potential Indemnitor fails to either contest or undertake settlement negotiations in connection with the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or reach a compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified Partys settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in any respect inadequate or unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 

   ##### 

  

    

potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in
_Section 4.2(a)(ii)_ within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential
Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to
the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential
Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after
receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by
such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to
the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure
to provide notice within the 30-day period. 

  

 (b) _Non Third Party Claims_. 

    

 (i) Each Party shall deliver to the other Party or parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this _Section 4_ written notice of any claims for indemnification under this _Section 4_ other than Third Party Claims, which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the basis for the claim, and a good faith estimate of the actual or future potential amount of Losses. 

   

 (ii) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this Section 4 (a "Response Notice"). If the potential Indemnitor does not provide a Response Notice to the Indemnified Party within the required 30-day period, the Indemnitor shall be deemed to accept liability for all Losses described in the claim notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide a Response Notice within such 30-day time period the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such claim to an officer of the potential Indemnitor.

In the event of any such determination, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement to fulfill as closely as possible the original intents and purposes hereof. To the extent permitted by law, the Parties hereby waive to the same extent any provision of law that renders any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.
