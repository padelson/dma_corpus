Stock for the ten trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the "Average Price"); provided, however, that if the Average
Price would be greater than Fifty-Five Dollars ($55.00) per share, then the
Average Price shall be deemed to be Fifty-Five Dollars ($55.00) per share for
purposes of calculating the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered as
the Share Consideration portion of the Equity Purchase Price. The Parties agree
that the aggregate consideration to be paid by Buyer to Sellers in connection
with the Transaction (the "Aggregate Consideration") comprises (A) the Assumed
Liabilities, (B) the Cash Consideration and (C) the Share Consideration.

         (b) Indemnity Deposit, LC Deposit and Litigation Deposit; Delivery of
Consideration. The Indemnity Deposit (which shall constitute a part of and be
withheld from the Share Consideration otherwise payable to Sellers) and the LC
Deposit (which shall constitute a part of and be withheld from the Share
Consideration otherwise payable to Sellers) shall be delivered by Buyer to the
Escrow Agent as provided in Section 8.03(b) and shall be held and disbursed by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement. The Litigation Deposit (which shall be deducted from and
reduce the amount of Cash Consideration otherwise payable to Sellers) shall be
delivered by Buyer to an

account under the control of the Massachusetts Court as provided in Section
8.03(c) and shall be held and disbursed by the Massachusetts Court. The Cash
Consideration (less the Litigation Deposit) shall be paid at the Closing by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by
Sellers in writing (and, to the extent applicable, the Litigation Deposit shall
be transferred by wire transfer to the account designated by the Massachusetts
Court), and the Parties shall execute such receipts or other acknowledgments as
are reasonably necessary to evidence payment and receipt of the Cash
Consideration. The Share Consideration, less the Indemnity Deposit and the LC
Deposit, shall be paid at the Closing by the issuance of shares of Common Stock
to Sellers and the delivery to Sellers at the Closing of one or more stock
certificates in the name of Sellers or their designees representing the Common
Stock comprising the Share Consideration issued pursuant to this Agreement.

         (c) Equity Purchase Price Adjustments.


              (i) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, S & W shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer the Closing Balance Sheet together with the report of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP thereon. The Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the presentation of
the March 31 Balance Sheet except with respect to the classification of the TPPI
Equipment and except for using estimated costs of completion, change order
recoveries and claim recoveries with respect to Rejected Contracts and Completed
Contracts and liability estimates with respect to matters set forth in Section
2.04(f) as of March 31, 2000 without further revisions. Buyer shall cause the
Hired Employees to assist Seller in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by an
additional schedule of information (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule")
which shall contain (x) a detailed list of the assets of Sellers related to the
Rejected Contracts and Completed Contracts and the liabilities of Sellers
related to the Rejected Contracts, the Completed Contracts and the Excluded
Liabilities (other than the liabilities for items characterized as deferred
income taxes on the March 31 Balance Sheet and the Closing Balance Sheet,
liabilities and obligations related to the ESOP, Taxes resulting from the
consummation of the Transaction and those items referenced in Section 2.04(k)
and Section 2.04(l) and any liabilities relating to the TPPI Contract), in each
case that are included in the Closing Balance Sheet and (y) a calculation
showing the sum of such assets (the "Adjustment Assets") and the sum of such
liabilities (the "Adjustment Liabilities") and the difference resulting from the
Adjustment Assets less the Adjustment Liabilities (the "Adjustment Amount");
provided, however, any adjustments included in the Adjustment Amount as the
result of the write off or write down of accounts receivable related to Rejected
Contracts or Completed Contracts shall not exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate.

              (ii) If Buyer disagrees with the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet or the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule, Buyer shall notify S &
W in writing of such disagreement within 30 days after delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule, which notice shall
describe the nature of any such disagreement and provide reasonable supporting
documentation for each such disagreement. During the 30 day period of its
review, Buyer shall have reasonable access to any documents, schedules or work
papers used in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Purchase
Price Adjustment Schedule.


                                       19
<PAGE>   27


              (iii) Buyer and S & W agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve
any such disagreement regarding the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet or
the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule, and any resolution of such disagreement
agreed to in writing by Buyer and S & W shall be final and binding upon the
parties. If Buyer and S & W are unable to resolve all disagreements identified
by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii) within 30 days after delivery to Seller
of written notice of such disagreement by Buyer, then the disputed matters shall
be referred for final determination to Deloitte & Touche LLP. If Deloitte &
Touche LLP is unable to serve, Buyer and S & W shall jointly select an arbiter
from one of the "Big 5" accounting firms that is not the independent auditor for
either Buyer or S & W; provided, however, that if Buyer and S & W are unable to
select such an arbiter within such time period, the American Arbitration
Association shall make such selection (Deloitte & Touche LLP or any other person
so selected shall be referred to herein as the "Accounting Arbitrator".) The
Accounting Arbitrator will only consider those items and amounts as to which
Buyer and S & W have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms
specified above and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall select as a
resolution the position of either Buyer or S & W for each item of disagreement
(based solely on presentations and supporting material provided by the parties
and not pursuant to any independent review) and may not impose an alternative
resolution. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Buyer and S & W, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within 45 days after its appointment, a
written report setting forth the resolution of any such disagreement determined
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such report shall be final and
binding upon the parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The
fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by
Buyer and one-half by S & W.

              (iv) If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined after the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.05(c), is a positive number the Equity
Purchase Price shall be decreased dollar for dollar by the Adjustment Amount,
and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Equity Purchase Price
shall be increased dollar for dollar by the Adjustment Amount (expressed as a
positive number). If the Equity Purchase Price is decreased as a result of the
purchase price adjustment, S & W shall pay to Buyer the amount of such decrease,
and if the Equity Purchase Price is increased as a result of such adjustment,
the Buyer shall pay to S & W the amount of such increase, in each case, by
delivery within 5 days of such determination shares of Common Stock calculated
on the basis of the Average Price; provided, however, that Buyer may, at its
election and in its sole discretion, pay Sellers all or any portion of any
increased Equity Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.05(c)(iv) in cash in
lieu of delivering some or all of any shares of Common Stock to be delivered
pursuant to this Section 2.05(c)(iv).

         (d) Allocation of Equity Purchase Price. Buyer and Sellers agree that a
portion of the Equity Purchase Price shall be allocated and delivered to any
Foreign Seller as required by applicable Legal Requirements for the reasonable
protection of the Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be.

         2.06. Registration Rights. Sellers shall be given registration rights
with respect to the Common Stock comprising the Share Consideration, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement by and among Buyer
and those Sellers who will hold Common Stock comprising the Share Consideration.

         2.07. Addition of Sellers; Schedules. S & W agrees that it will cause
this Agreement to be amended to add as Sellers hereunder any of its Subsidiaries
that have any right, title or interest in or to any of the Assets. S & W and
Buyer agree that any references herein to Sellers shall mean and include S & W
and all such Subsidiaries, and the representations and warranties of S & W in
this Agreement shall be made with respect to all Sellers as if all Sellers had
been Parties to this Agreement on the date hereof. The Schedules referred to in
this Agreement shall be delivered concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement. Such Schedules may be amended to reflect any changes required as a
result of the addition of applicable Subsidiaries as additional Sellers
hereunder. Buyer shall have two business days from the delivery of amended

3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF S & W

         S & W hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

         3.01. Organization. Each Seller is duly organized, validly existing
and, to the extent applicable in the case of Foreign Sellers, in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case
may be. Each Seller is licensed, registered, qualified or admitted to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, use or leasing of any of
such Seller's assets or properties (including the Assets), or the conduct or
nature of the Business, makes such licensing, registration, qualification or
admission necessary, except where such failure would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         3.02. Powers; Consents; Absence of Conflicts, Etc. Subject to approval
of this Agreement by the Bankruptcy Court, each Seller has the requisite power
and authority to conduct its businesses as now being conducted, to enter into
this Agreement and to perform its respective obligations hereunder, and the
execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transaction:

         (a) are within such Seller's corporate powers, are not in contravention
of the terms of its articles or certificate of incorporation or other
organizational documents, as amended to date, or its bylaws and other governing
documents, as amended to date, and have been duly authorized by all appropriate
corporate, partnership, shareholder and partner action, as the case may be;

         (b) except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as set
forth on Schedule 3.02(b), do not require any approval or consent of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority;

         (c) except as set forth on Schedule 3.02(c) or as excused by the
Bankruptcy Court, do not conflict with, or result in any breach or contravention
of, any Assumed Contract to which any Seller is a party or by which it is bound;
and

         (d) do not violate any Legal Requirement to which any Seller or the
Assets may be subject;

except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (b), (c) and (d), for such
conflicts or violations as to which requisite waivers or consents have been
obtained or which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.


                                       21
<PAGE>   29


         3.03. Binding Agreement. This Agreement and all instruments and
agreements hereunder to which each Seller is or becomes a party are (or upon
execution will be) valid and legally binding obligations of each such Seller,
enforceable against each Seller in accordance with the respective terms hereof
or thereof, except as enforceability may be subject to general principles of
equity and enforceability may be restricted, limited or delayed by applicable
bankruptcy or other laws effecting creditors' rights generally.

         3.04. Subsidiaries, Investments and Third Party Rights. After the
Closing, no Seller will conduct any business that competes with the Business and
no Seller will own or hold any interests in any Persons that conduct any
business that competes with the Business, except and solely to the extent
necessary to fulfill the obligations of any Seller under any Contracts other
than the Assumed Contracts. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.01(i), no Seller
holds any Investments that are not reflected as assets on the March 31 Balance
Sheet. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04, there are no agreements with, or
options, commitments or rights in favor of, any Person to directly or indirectly
acquire any of the Assets, or any interest therein.

         3.05. Legal and Regulatory Compliance. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.05, each Seller is in compliance with all Legal Requirements, and has timely
filed all reports, data and other information required to be filed with
Governmental Authorities, except where a failure to be in compliance or file
timely would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

         3.06. Financial Statements. Attached as Schedule 3.06 are copies of the
Audited Financial Statements, the Unaudited Financial Statements, the Interim
Financial Statements and the interim financial statements as of June 30, 2000 of
the Foreign Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.08, the Financial
Statements are true, complete and accurate in all material respects and fairly
present the financial condition and results of operations of S & W as of the
respective dates thereof and for the periods therein referred to, all in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), subject in
the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements and Interim Financial Statements
to normal recurring quarterly and year-end adjustments (the effect of which will
not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse) and the absence of
notes (which, if presented, would not differ materially from those included in
the Audited Financial Statements); and the Financial Statements reflect the
consistent application of such accounting principles throughout the periods
involved.

         3.07. Undisclosed Liabilities. Schedule 3.07 contains an accurate
description, to the Knowledge of Sellers, of all material liabilities of Sellers
not included in the Audited Financial Statements or the Unaudited Financial
Statements of any nature relating to the Assets or the Business, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, together with, in the case of those
liabilities which are not fixed in amount, a reasonable estimate of the maximum
amount which may be payable in respect thereof.

         3.08. Recent Activities. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.08:

         (a) Since April 30, 2000, and except for the announcement of the
Transaction, the filing of the Bankruptcy Cases and disruptions arising

any such action, suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation. No Party in
Interest has any interest in any assets of any Employee Benefit Pension Plan

experienced in evaluating companies such as Buyer, is able to fend for itself in
transactions such as the Transaction, has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and

Consideration. Except as may be required in connection with or pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Cases, each Holder is acquiring the Common Stock comprising the Share
Consideration for investment for its own account and not with the view to, or
for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Each Holder understands
that the Common Stock comprising the Share Consideration has not been registered
under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption from the registration
provisions of the Securities Act that depends upon, among other things, the bona
fide nature of the investment intent as expressed herein. Each Holder further
represents that it does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or
arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participation to any
third party with respect to any of the Common Stock comprising the Share
Consideration. Each Holder understands and acknowledges that the Common Stock

subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Each Holder covenants that,
in the absence of an effective registration statement covering the Common Stock
comprising the



                                       31
<PAGE>   39


Share Consideration, it will sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such Common
Stock only in a manner consistent with its obligations under the Registration
Rights Agreement or in compliance with applicable securities laws. In connection
therewith, each Holder acknowledges that Buyer will make a notation on its stock
books regarding the restrictions on transfers set forth in this Section 3.30 and
the Registration Rights Agreement and will transfer securities on the books of
Buyer only to the extent not inconsistent herewith and therewith.

         (b) No Seller, nor any director, officer, employee, agent or consultant
of any Seller, is (or during the last five years has been) suspended or debarred
from doing business with any Governmental Authority or has been declared
nonresponsible or ineligible for U.S. Government contracting. To the Knowledge
of Sellers, there exist no circumstances that would warrant the institution of
suspension or debarment proceedings or the finding of nonresponsibility or
ineligibility in the future on the part of the Sellers or Buyer as the purchaser
of the Assets, except as may result from Sellers' current financial condition or
the filing of the Bankruptcy Cases.

         (c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in full compliance

Date and (e) with respect to unbilled Accounts Receivable, there exists no fact
that would prohibit or restrict the billing of any such unbilled Accounts
Receivable in the ordinary course of business or, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
would render such unbilled Accounts Receivable uncollectable within 90 days from
the date of invoice.

benefits payable in the ordinary course of the Business, (ii) for normal travel
advances made in the ordinary course of the Business consistent with past
practice and (iii) as set forth on Schedule 3.33, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
no director, officer, partner, employee, "affiliate" or "associate" (as such

Seller in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000);

         (c) increase compensation payable or to become payable to, make a bonus

         (k) terminate, amend or otherwise modify any Employee Benefit Plan or
Other Plan, except for amendments required to comply with applicable Legal

         5.04. Employee Matters.

         (a) Subject to the exclusions set forth in this Section 5.04, Buyer may
communicate (after consulting with management of S & W) with any employees of
any Seller and may offer, or cause its Affiliates to offer, to employ as of the
Closing Date all active employees of Sellers working at the Business on the
Closing Date to whom Buyer, in its sole discretion, may choose to make offers of
employment, all in the manner and upon terms and conditions of employment which
are generally comparable to similarly situated employees of Buyer. It is the
intent of Buyer to make offers of employment to substantially all of Sellers'
operating employees. Employees employed under Employee Agreements in place as of
March 31, 2000 or authorized as set forth on Schedule 5.04 (the "Employee
Agreements") will not be offered employment pursuant to this Section 5.04, but
such Employee Agreements shall become Assumed Contracts whether or not the
employees employed thereunder become employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
and employment of any employees employed thereunder by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall be governed by the terms of the Assumed Contracts relating to
such employees. Buyer shall give all Hired Employees credit for their vacation
and holiday accumulations to the extent the same constitute Assumed Liabilities.
Sellers acknowledge that all employment offers are subject to the satisfactory
completion by Buyer of its customary employee background checks. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect in any manner the right of Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer to




                                       37
<PAGE>   45


terminate at will the employment of any Hired Employee (except as otherwise
provided in Assumed Contracts with such employees). Sellers shall be responsible
for and pay any and all liabilities or obligations arising under the WARN Act,
if any, arising out of or resulting from layoffs of employees prior to Closing
and/or the consummation of the Transaction, and Sellers shall remain liable for
any and all costs and expenses associated with continued employment, or
termination and severance, of all employees of Sellers other than the Hired
Employees and employees with respect to whom Buyer shall assume any liabilities
under the Employee Agreements, including any obligation imposed on Sellers or
Buyer to provide such employees with continued health, disability, life or other
retirement benefits (whether covered by insurance or not). Buyer shall not, at
any time prior to 90 days after the Closing Date, without complying fully with
the notice and other requirements of the WARN Act, effectuate (i) a "plant
closing" as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of employment or one or
more facilities or operating units within any site of employment of the
Business; or (ii) a "mass layoff" as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site
of employment of the Business; or any similar action under applicable state or
foreign law requiring notice to employees in the event of a plant closing or
layoff. In addition, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Sellers harmless
from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses, obligations and
liabilities (including costs of collection, attorney's fees and other costs of
defense) which Sellers may incur in connection with any suit or claim of
violation brought against Sellers under the WARN Act or any similar state or
foreign law, which relates to actions taken by Buyer after the Closing Date with
regard to any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment of the Business.

         (b) Buyer shall as of the Closing Date assume the sponsorship of the
Retirement Plans (but not any other Employee Benefit Plan listed on Schedule
3.20(a)), and in connection therewith shall assume all responsibility for the
administration of such plans and their assets and liabilities. Buyer shall be
responsible for all contributions to the Retirement Plans (but not any other
Employee Benefit Plan listed on Schedule 3.20(a)), due after the Closing Date.
Buyer shall arrange effective as of the Closing Date to enter into appropriate
agreements or modify existing agreements with trustees and other vendors
providing services to the Retirement Plans.

         (c) Buyer and Sellers agree to negotiate in good faith with respect to
certain additional terms of employment for Hired Employees relating to
eligibility and participation (including recognition of S & W service) in the
Employee Benefit Plans of Buyer and the disposition of benefits under the
Employee Benefit Plans of Sellers.

         5.05. Access to and Provision of Additional Information.

         (a) From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Sellers shall
cooperate fully with Buyer and Buyer's representatives in connection with
Buyer's due diligence investigation of the prospects, business, assets,
Contracts, rights, liabilities and obligations of Sellers and the Business, and
shall provide to Buyer and Buyer's representatives full and complete access to
and the right to inspect the Business, any facilities associated with or used in
the Business, the Assets, and books and records of Sellers relating to Sellers,
the Assets and the Business, and will furnish to Buyer all material information
concerning Sellers, the Assets and the Business not otherwise disclosed pursuant
to this Agreement, all pleadings and other documents or schedules filed with the
Bankruptcy Court, access to Sellers' files and other records regarding claims,




                                       38
<PAGE>   46


actions, suits, litigation, arbitration, mediations, investigations and other
proceedings pending against or otherwise affecting any Seller, the Assets or the
Business, and such additional financial, operating and other data and
information regarding the Business as Buyer may from time to time reasonably
request, without regard to where such information may be located. In addition,
each Seller shall use its respective best efforts to cause its agents,
representatives, employees, officers, directors, vendors, suppliers, and
customers to cooperate with Buyer and Buyer's representatives in connection with
Buyer's due diligence review as it relates to any Contracts between any such
vendors, suppliers, and customers and any Seller.

         (b) From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause
their respective officers and employees to confer on a regular and frequent
basis with one or more representatives of Buyer and to answer Buyer's questions
regarding matters relating to the conduct of the Business and the status of the
Transaction. Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing of any material changes in
the operations, financial condition or prospects of the Business and of any
complaints, investigations, hearings or adjudicatory proceedings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) of any Person and
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of such matters.

         (c) The exercise by Buyer of any right of access granted herein shall
not materially interfere with the business operations of Sellers.

         (d) Except as provided in Article 8, each Party shall be responsible
for its own costs and expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 5.05.

         5.06. Post-Closing Maintenance of and Access to Information.

         (a) The parties acknowledge that after Closing each party may need
access to information or documents in the control or possession of another party
for the purposes of concluding the transactions herein contemplated, Tax Returns
or audits, the Assumed Contracts and other Legal Requirements, and the
prosecution or defense of third party claims. Accordingly, each party shall
keep, preserve and maintain in the ordinary course of business, and as required
by Legal Requirements and relevant insurance carriers, all books, records,
documents and other information in the possession or control of such party and
relevant to the foregoing purposes at least until the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof.

         (b) Each party shall cooperate fully in connection with, and make
available for inspection and copying by, the other party, its employees, agents,
counsel and accountants and/or Governmental Authorities, upon written request
and at the expense of the requesting party, such books, records documents and
other information to the extent reasonably necessary to facilitate the foregoing
purposes. In addition, each party shall cooperate with, and shall permit and use
its best efforts to cause, at the expense of the requesting party, its
respective former and present directors, officers and employees to cooperate
with, the other party on and after Closing in furnishing information, evidence,
testimony and other assistance in connection with any action, proceeding,
arrangement or dispute of any nature with respect to the subject matters of this
Agreement and pertaining to periods prior to the Closing Date.



                                       39
<PAGE>   47


         (c) Sellers shall be entitled to remove from the Business, at Sellers'
sole risk and expense, any records that relate to events or periods prior to
Closing for purposes of pending litigation involving matters to which such
records refer, as certified in writing prior to removal by counsel retained by
Sellers in connection with such litigation. Any records so removed shall be
promptly returned to Buyer following their use by Sellers.

         (d) The exercise by either party of any right of access granted herein
shall not materially interfere with the business operations of the other party.

         5.07. Governmental Authority Approvals: Consents to Assignment.

         (a) From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, each Seller and
Buyer shall (i) promptly apply for and use its respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain prior to Closing all consents, approvals,
authorizations and clearances of Governmental Authorities required of it to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provide such information
and communications to Governmental Authorities as the other party or such
Persons may reasonably request, and (iii) assist and cooperate with other
parties to obtain all Permits and clearances of Governmental Authorities that
the other parties reasonably deem necessary or appropriate, and to prepare any
document or other information reasonably required of it by any such Persons to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall have any obligation under such
provisions (x) to pay any cash amounts to Governmental Authorities other than
filing fees, or (y) to agree to divest assets or limit the operations of its
businesses.

         (b) From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, each of the parties
shall file, if and to the extent required by law, all reports or other documents
required or requested by Governmental Authorities under the HSR Act concerning
the purchase and sale of the Assets and comply promptly with any requests by the
Governmental Authorities for additional information concerning the purchase and
sale of the Assets, so that the waiting period specified in the HSR Act with
respect to those Assets will expire as soon as reasonably possible after the
Effective Date. Each of the parties shall furnish to the other parties such
information as the other parties reasonably require to perform their obligations
under the HSR Act and shall exchange drafts of the relevant portions of each
other's report forms prior to filing.

         (c) Sellers shall (i) obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the
assumption by and assignment to Buyer of the Assumed Contracts and (ii) obtain
all other consents, approvals and novations required to assign the Assumed
Contracts to Buyer.

         (d) In the event that any and all novations, transfer or other
agreements, consents, approvals or waivers necessary for the assignments,
transfer or novation of any Assumed Contracts, or any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, shall not have been obtained prior to
the Closing Date, then as of the Closing, this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by law, shall constitute full and equitable assignment by Sellers to
Buyer of all of Sellers' right, title and interest in and to, and all of
Sellers' obligations and liabilities under, such Assumed Contracts, and Buyer
shall be deemed Sellers' agent for the purpose of completing, fulfilling and
discharging all of Sellers' liabilities under any such Assumed Contracts. The
Parties shall take all necessary steps and actions to provide Buyer with the
benefits of such




                                       40
<PAGE>   48


Assumed Contracts, and to relieve Sellers of the performance and other
obligations thereunder, including entry into subcontracts for the performance
thereof. Buyer agrees to pay, perform and discharge, and indemnify Sellers
against and hold Sellers harmless from, all obligations and liabilities of
Sellers relating to such performance or failure to perform under such Assumed
Contracts after the Closing Date, in accordance with the provisions of Article 9
of this Agreement.

         (e) In the event Sellers shall be unable to make the equitable
assignment described in Section 5.07(d), or if such attempted assignment would
give rise to any right of termination, or would otherwise adversely affect the
rights of Sellers or Buyer under such Assumed Contracts, or would not assign all
Sellers' rights thereunder at the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall continue to
cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with all such rights.
To the extent that any such consents and waivers are not obtained, or until the
impediments to such assignment are resolved, Sellers shall use all reasonable
efforts (without the expenditure, in the aggregate, of any material sum) to (i)
provide to Buyer, at the request of Buyer, the benefits of any such Assumed
Contract to the extent related to the Business or the Assets, (ii) cooperate in
any lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer and (iii)
enforce, at the request of and for the account of Buyer, any rights of Sellers
arising from any such Assumed Contracts against any third Person (including any
Governmental Authority) including the right to elect to terminate in accordance
with the terms thereof upon the advice of Buyer. To the extent that Buyer is
provided the benefits of any Assumed Contract referred to herein (whether from
Sellers or otherwise), Buyer shall perform at the reasonable direction of
Sellers and for the benefit of any third Person (including any Governmental
Authority) the obligations of Sellers thereunder or in connection therewith, and
Buyer agrees to pay, perform and discharge, and indemnify Sellers against and
hold Sellers harmless from, all obligations and liabilities of Sellers relating
to such performance or failure to perform, after the Closing Date, in accordance
with the provisions of Article 9 of this Agreement.

         5.08. Noncompetition.

         (a) For a period of five years from and after the Closing Date, except
and solely to the extent as is required to perform any Rejected Contracts
assumed pursuant to Section 5.16(b) or Completed Contracts, no Seller shall,
directly or indirectly, in any capacity:

                  (i) own, lease, manage, operate, control, participate in the
         management or control of, be employed by, or maintain or continue any
         interest whatsoever in any enterprise engaged in any business
         competitive with the Business; or

                  (ii) employ or solicit the employment of any Hired Employee
         unless (x) such employee resigns voluntarily (without any solicitation
         from Sellers), (y) Buyer consents in writing to such employment or
         solicitation, or (z) such employee is terminated by Buyer after the
         Closing Date; or

                  (iii) induce, cause or attempt to induce or cause any Person
         to replace or terminate any Contract relating to the Business with
         products or services of any other Person at any time after the Closing
         Date.




                                       41
<PAGE>   49



         (b) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that any remedy at law for any
breach of this Section 5.08 would be inadequate and consents to the granting by
any court of an injunction or other equitable relief, without the necessity of
actual monetary loss being proved, in order that a breach or threatened breach
of this Section may be effectively enjoined.

         5.09. Use of Names. From and after Closing, Sellers shall not use any
of the names acquired pursuant to this Agreement or any variation of the
foregoing in the conduct of any of their businesses, except as is required in or
in connection with the Bankruptcy Cases and except and solely to the extent as
is required to perform any Rejected Contracts assumed pursuant to Section
5.16(b) or Contracts subject to Section 5.07(d) and Section 5.07(e).

         5.10. Allocation of Equity Purchase Price for Tax Purposes. Sellers and
Buyer agree that, for tax purposes, the Equity Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Assets as Buyer may determine, in accordance with their fair market
values consistent with Section 1060 of the Code, and such allocation shall be
binding upon the parties for all applicable federal, state, local and foreign
Tax purposes. Sellers and Buyer covenant to report gain or loss or cost basis,
as the case may be, in a manner consistent with such allocation on all Tax
Returns filed by any of them after Closing and not to voluntarily take any
inconsistent position therewith in any administrative or judicial proceeding
relating to such returns. Sellers and Buyer shall exchange mutually acceptable
and completed IRS Forms 8594 (including supplemental forms, if required), which
they shall use to report the transaction contemplated hereunder to the Internal
Revenue Service in accordance with such allocation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, no allocation hereunder shall supersede or otherwise usurp the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court to value the assets for purposes of
distribution to the respective Sellers' estates under the Bankruptcy Code.

         5.11. Further Acts and Assurances. At any time and from time to time at
and after the Closing, upon request of Buyer, each Seller shall do, execute,
acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and
delivered, such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances, powers
of attorney, confirmations and assurances as Buyer may reasonably request to
more effectively convey, assign and transfer to and vest in Buyer, its
successors and assigns, full legal right, title and interest in and actual
possession of the Assets and the Business, to confirm such Seller's capacity and
ability to perform its pre-Closing and post-Closing covenants and agreements
under this Agreement, and to generally carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement. Each Seller shall also furnish Buyer with such information and
documents in its possession or under its control, or which such Seller can
execute or cause to be executed, as will enable Buyer to prosecute any and all
petitions, applications, claims and demands relating to or constituting a part
of the Assets and the Business.

         5.12. Costs and Expenses.

         (a) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, all
expenses of the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and related to the
Transaction, including legal counsel, accounting, brokerage and investment
advisor fees and disbursements, shall be borne by the respective Party incurring
such expense, whether or not the Transaction is consummated. Sellers shall be
responsible for paying any allowed fees and expenses of Lazard Freres & Co.




                                       42
<PAGE>   50


LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co. in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

         (b) Buyer shall pay the cost of Buyer's owner's title insurance
policies described in Section 7.05, and Sellers shall pay the cost of removing
Encumbrances that are not Permitted Real Property Encumbrances. Buyer shall pay
the cost of Buyer's land title surveys of the Real Property, and environmental,
engineering and other professional studies undertaken by Buyer.

         (c) In the event any Party elects to incur legal fees or expenses to
enforce or interpret any provision of this Agreement and subject to any required
approvals of the Bankruptcy Court, the prevailing Party will be entitled to
recover such legal fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees, costs and
necessary disbursements, in addition to any other relief to which such Party
shall be entitled.

         5.13. Insurance Ratings. From the Effective Date until the Closing
Date, Sellers will take all actions reasonably requested by Buyer to enable
Buyer to succeed to the Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Insurance
ratings, insurance policies, deposits and other interests of Sellers and the
Business for insurance or other purposes. Buyer shall not be obligated to
succeed to any such rating, insurance policy, deposit or other interest, except
as it may elect to do so.

         5.14. Fulfillment of Conditions. Each party will execute and deliver at
Closing each agreement, instrument or other document that such party is required
by this Agreement to execute and deliver as a condition to Closing, and will
take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or desirable and proceed
diligently and in good faith to satisfy each other condition to the obligations
of the parties contained in this Agreement, to the extent that satisfaction of
such condition is within the control of such party.

         5.15. Release of Encumbrances. Except as set forth in this Agreement or
in the Sale Order, Sellers shall cause all Encumbrances other than the Permitted
Real Property Encumbrances to be released and discharged at or prior to Closing,
which Encumbrances, as to Sellers that have filed Bankruptcy Cases, may be
released and discharged by the Bankruptcy Court in the Sale Order.

         5.16. Assumed and Assigned Contracts; Rejected Contracts.

         (a) Assumed Contracts. Subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court
and pursuant to the Executory Contract Assumption and Assignment Order, the
Assumed Contracts, including the Employee Agreements, will be assumed by Sellers
and assigned to Buyer or Buyer's designee on the Closing Date under Section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code. Sellers shall, consistent with their current financial
condition and the Bankruptcy Cases, use their respective best efforts to
promptly comply with and perform any obligations under the Assumed Contracts
arising from and after the Effective Date and through the Closing Date. In the
Sale Motion, or in such additional or subsequent motions as may be appropriate,
Sellers will seek authority to assume and assign the Assumed Contracts to Buyer
(or Buyer's designee) in accordance with Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. All
Assumed Contracts shall be assigned to and assumed by Buyer (or Buyer's
designee) at Closing. Subject to the following right of Sellers to reject any



                                       43
<PAGE>   51

Contract, the final determination of which Contracts Sellers will assume and
assign to Buyer shall be within the sole discretion of Buyer.

         (b) Rejected Contracts. Schedule 5.16(b) contains the schedule of
Rejected Contracts. Subsequent to the Court's approval of this Agreement and
prior to Closing, Sellers shall consult with Buyer about any Contract Sellers
seek to reject and consider in good faith Buyer's opinions on any such
rejection, in recognition of Buyer's bona fide interest in preserving to the
maximum extent possible the Contracts which Buyer believes are reasonably
necessary to the continued operation and financial viability of the Business
after Closing, but Sellers shall have the right in their discretion to reject
any Contract which in their judgment Sellers believe must be rejected to
maintain the viability of the Business prior to the Closing Date or to comply
with any order of the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, subject to the approval of
the Bankruptcy Court and after receipt of Buyer's prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld), Sellers may assume any Rejected Contract if
the total cost of completing such Rejected Contract would be materially less
costly than the reasonably anticipated damages that would be payable by Sellers
in connection with a claim for material breach of such Rejected Contract. In the
event that Sellers should assume any such Rejected Contract, Buyer shall grant
Sellers a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use or exploit those items
constituting Intellectual Properties as may be reasonably necessary to perform
such Rejected Contract assumed by Sellers pursuant to this Section 5.16(b) and
the Completed Contracts.

         5.17. Bankruptcy Court Approval.

         (a) Sellers shall use their respective best efforts to obtain the Sale
Order which, among other things, (i) determines that this Agreement was proposed
by Buyer in good faith and represents the highest and best offer for the Assets
and should be approved, (ii) determines that Buyer is a good faith purchaser
under Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code and that the provisions of Section
363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code have not been violated, (iii) authorizes and
directs Sellers to assume this Agreement and sell the Assets to Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement and Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, free and
clear of all liens, claims, interests, liabilities and Encumbrances (including
any and all "interests" in the Assets within the meaning of Section 363(f) of
the Bankruptcy Code), other than the Assumed Liabilities and the Permitted Real
Property Encumbrances, such that Buyer shall not incur any liability as a
successor to the Business, (iv) authorizes and directs Sellers to execute,
deliver, perform under, consummate and implement, this Agreement, together with
all additional instruments and documents, including the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, that may be reasonably necessary or desirable to implement the
foregoing; (v) authorizes claims and recourse by Buyer against the Indemnity
Deposit for any reason set forth in Section 9.01, including breach of any
representation and warranty of S & W in this Agreement, regardless of whether
such breach relates to Assets owned or leased by S & W or any other Seller
(regardless of whether such other Seller is a debtor in the Bankruptcy Cases),
(vi) authorizes claims and recourse by Buyer against the LC Deposit as provided
in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and (vii) determines that Buyer is not a
successor to Sellers or otherwise liable for any Excluded Liability and
permanently enjoins each and every holder of an Excluded Liability from
commencing, continuing or otherwise pursuing or enforcing any remedy, claim or
cause of action against Buyer relative to such Excluded Liability.

         (b) Sellers shall obtain the Executory Contract Assumption and
Assignment Order.



                                       44
<PAGE>   52


         (c) Sellers shall promptly make any filings, take all actions, and use
their respective best efforts to obtain any and all other approvals and orders
necessary or appropriate for consummation of the Transaction, subject to their
obligations to comply with any order of the Bankruptcy Court.

         (d) In the event an appeal is taken, or a stay pending appeal is
requested, from the Sale Order or the Executory Contract Assumption and
Assignment Order, Sellers shall immediately notify Buyer of such appeal or stay
request and shall provide to Buyer within one business day a copy of the related
notice of appeal or order of stay. Sellers shall also provide Buyer with written
notice of any motion or application filed in connection with any appeal from
either of such orders.

         (e) Buyer shall cooperate in providing such information and evidence as
is necessary to obtain the orders described in this Section 5.17.

         5.18. Transfer Taxes. In accordance with Section 1146(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code, the making or delivery of any instrument of transfer, including
the filing of any deed or other document of transfer to evidence, effectuate or
perfect the rights, transfers and interest contemplated by this Agreement, shall
be in contemplation of a plan or plans of reorganization to be confirmed in the
Bankruptcy Cases, and as such shall be free and clear of any and all transfer

<PAGE>   54


listed in this Section 5.26 is a directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiary
of S & W and each shall constitute a "Foreign Subsidiary" for purposes of this
Section 5.26 and as a "Subsidiary" or "Seller" for all other purposes of this
Agreement as applicable. Nothing set forth herein shall limit or replace any
other provision of this Agreement, it being the intention of the parties that
the provisions of this Section 5.26 are in addition to and not in substitution
for any other provision of this Agreement. Each Foreign Subsidiary hereby
severally represents, warrants and covenants as to itself to Buyer as follows:

         (a) Adherence. The Board of Directors of such Foreign Subsidiary has
reviewed the terms of this Agreement and acknowledges that part of the
consideration payable hereunder by Buyer relates to assets of such Foreign
Subsidiary. Such Foreign Subsidiary warrants that the directors have determined
that the terms of this Agreement as they relate to such Foreign Subsidiary are
in the best interests of such Foreign Subsidiary and that such Foreign
Subsidiary has chosen freely to join this Agreement for all such purposes
hereunder as are applicable to such Foreign Subsidiary and its assets.

         (b) Apportionment of Consideration. Such Foreign Subsidiary covenants
that it will agree to the apportionment and application of the consideration to
be paid by Buyer to S & W pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the assets of
such Foreign Subsidiary that are to be sold to Buyer hereunder; provided,
however, that the consideration to be allocated to such Foreign Subsidiary must
be paid to or effectively credited to such Foreign Subsidiary under governing
financial accounting practices and, provided further, that such Foreign
Subsidiary shall not be obligated to convey an asset if the consideration to be
paid in respect of the asset is determined by its directors acting in good faith
to be manifestly unfair to such Foreign Subsidiary or otherwise to constitute
less than fair value for such asset and such determination by the Board of
Directors is supported by the determination of a firm of independent chartered
accountants selected by such Foreign Subsidiary and Buyer for such purpose.

         (c) Solvency. Such Foreign Subsidiary is solvent (under the law
applicable to such Foreign Subsidiary) as of the date hereof and will
immediately following Closing be solvent.

         (d) Pension Plans. If Buyer should become liable under any applicable
law to succeed to employment obligations of such Foreign Subsidiary and if such
Foreign Subsidiary is a sponsor or employer under a pension plan on the date
hereof, then such Foreign Subsidiary covenants that it will exercise its best
efforts to complete agreement with Buyer at Buyer's election so as to ensure
that Buyer, in its capacity of employer or sponsor of such plan, succeeds to the
full benefit of such pension plan (including any funding surplus) in any
agreement between such Foreign Subsidiary and Buyer pursuant to which Buyer or
its designee elects to succeed to such Foreign Subsidiary's rights and
obligations under or in respect of such pension plan.

         (e) Cooperation. Such Foreign Subsidiary, subject to the provisos of
Section 5.26(b), will provide its full and complete cooperation in the
completion of the sale or transfer of those of its assets to be sold or
transferred to Buyer or for its benefit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
so as to vest irrevocable and unencumbered title to all such assets in Buyer or
its




                                       47
<PAGE>   55


designee. In furtherance hereof, such Foreign Subsidiary agrees to take all such
actions as a Seller as are specified in Section 5.11.

         5.27 Jacobs Credit Agreement. Buyer shall refinance or purchase from
Jacobs all advances outstanding (including any costs and expenses due) under the
Jacobs Credit Agreement within one business day after entry by the Bankruptcy
Court of the Sale Order.

         5.28 Canadian Transfer.

              (a) The Canadian Assets are included in the Assets. Sellers agree
to use best efforts to transfer the Canadian Assets to Buyer as soon as
practicable.

              (b) Buyer shall not transfer the Canadian Consideration to
Sellers, and Buyer shall not assume the Canadian Liabilities, unless and until
Sellers shall make a legal, valid and effective transfer of the Canadian Assets
to Buyer (the "Canadian Transfer"). Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, until the Canadian Transfer: (i) the Cash
Consideration, the Share Consideration and the Aggregate Consideration shall not
include the Canadian Consideration, (ii) the Canadian Assets shall be Excluded
Assets and (iii) the Canadian Liabilities shall be Excluded Liabilities.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the
Canadian Transfer: (x) the Cash Consideration, the Share Consideration and the
Aggregate Consideration shall include the Canadian Consideration, (y) the Assets
shall include the Canadian Assets and (z) the Assumed Liabilities shall include
the Canadian Liabilities. This Section 5.28(b) does not relieve Sellers of their
obligations and liabilities under Section 5.28(a) and Section 5.28(c).

              (c) If Sellers do not transfer the Canadian Assets to Buyer or if
Buyer must pay amounts in excess of the Canadian Consideration to acquire the
Canadian Assets, then Buyer shall have a claim or claims against Sellers under
the Agreement for the value of the Canadian Assets not transferred and/or such
additional amounts paid (a "Canadian Transfer Claim"), which can be satisfied
out of the Canadian Consideration, and if the Canadian Consideration is not
sufficient to satisfy such claim, the Canadian Transfer Claim in excess of the
Canadian Consideration shall have an administrative priority in Sellers' estates
under Sections 503(b) and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  The parties reserve their right to dispute the appropriate
amount of the Canadian Transfer Claim, if any. The amount of the Canadian
Consideration shall not be evidence for either party of the appropriate amount
of such claim, nor shall it be evidence of the amount of the overall purchase
price attributable to the Canadian Assets.

                  If the Canadian Transfer does not occur, then the parties
shall attempt to agree upon the amount of the Canadian Transfer Claim; if they
cannot agree, then they shall submit the matter to the Bankruptcy Court for
resolution. If the Canadian Transfer does not occur, for purposes of calculating
the Adjustment Amount, the Canadian Assets attributable to Completed Contracts
and Rejected Contracts shall not be deemed to be Adjustment Assets and the
Canadian Liabilities shall not be deemed to be Adjustment Liabilities.

              (d) No Seller nor any Affiliate of any Seller (including any
officer or director of any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller) shall acquire,
bid for or otherwise seek to acquire, or




                                       48
<PAGE>   56


assist (except as may be required under Canadian bankruptcy law) any other party
in any way in connection with the acquisition, bidding for or attempt to
acquire, the Canadian Assets. Sellers shall be liable to Buyer for any
out-of-pocket losses, costs or expenses actually incurred by Buyer as a result
of a breach of this Section 5.28(d).

         (a) accrue to any of Buyer's Indemnified Persons against any Seller
under Section 9.01(a) unless and until the total liability of Sellers in respect
of claims arising under Section 9.01(a) exceeds Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) in the aggregate; provided, however, that there
shall be no minimum Loss requirement, and liability of Sellers shall arise from
and after One Dollar ($1.00) of Losses, in respect of Losses resulting from any
Seller's intentional misrepresentation or fraud;

         (b) be made unless notice thereof shall have been given by or on behalf
of any of Buyer's Indemnified Persons to Sellers in the manner provided in
Section 9.05; or

         (c) be recoverable by Buyer except (i) until a plan of reorganization
in the Bankruptcy Cases has become effective or, if the cases are converted to
Chapter 7 cases, until each such case is closed, as administrative expenses of
Sellers' bankruptcy estates, (ii) against the Indemnity Deposit or the LC
Deposit for claims asserted within eighteen months after the Closing Date
(unless a longer period is specified in Section 9.06 with respect to a
representation and warranty), and (iii) pursuant to Buyer's rights of offset and
set off in Section 10.11;

provided, however, that all claims for indemnification made by Buyer under this
Section 9 will survive any termination or expiration described above and be
recoverable from the sources described above until such claims shall have been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided herein.

         9.03. Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to and to the extent provided
in this Section 9, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Sellers' Indemnified Persons, and each of them, from
and against any Losses incurred or suffered by Sellers' Indemnified Persons,
directly or indirectly, as a result of or arising from:

         (a) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Buyer, whether
or not Sellers' Indemnified Persons relied thereon or had knowledge thereof;

         (b) the nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other obligation
of Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument
delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; and

         (c) the Assumed Liabilities.

         9.04. Buyer's Limitations. Buyer shall have no liability under Section
9.03 and no claim under Section 9.03 shall:

         (a) accrue to any of Sellers' Indemnified Persons against Buyer under

claims arising under Section 9.03(a)




                                       55

exceeds Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) in the aggregate;
provided, however, that there shall be no minimum Loss requirement, and
liability of Buyer shall arise from and after One Dollar ($1.00) of Losses, in
respect of Losses resulting from Buyer's intentional misrepresentation or fraud;
or

         (b) be made unless notice thereof shall have been given by or on behalf
of any of Sellers' Indemnified Persons to Buyer in the manner provided in
Section 9.05;

provided, however, that all claims for indemnification made by Sellers under
this Section 9 will survive any termination or expiration described above and be
recoverable from the sources described above until such claims shall have been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided herein.

         9.05. Notice and Procedure. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party against an Indemnifying Party under this Section 9 shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:

                  (a)(i) If any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party
         would be liable for Losses to an Indemnified Party is alleged or
         asserted by a Person other than any Buyer's Indemnified Person or any
         Sellers' Indemnified Person (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified
         Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the
         Indemnifying Party, together with a copy of all papers served, if any,
         and specifying the nature of and alleged basis for the Third Party
         Claim and, to the extent then feasible, the alleged amount or the
         estimated amount of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party
         fails to deliver the Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within 30
         days after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such Third Party
         Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
         Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim if and only to
         the extent that the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend the Third
         Party Claim has been irreparably prejudiced by such failure. The
         Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days
         after receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") whether the
         Indemnifying Party intends, at the sole cost and expense of the
         Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third
         Party Claim.

                  (ii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
         within the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party intends to defend
         the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim, then the
         Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, at its sole cost and
         expense, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
         proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to
         a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying
         Party (with the consent of the Indemnified Party). The Indemnifying
         Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings; provided,
         however, that the Indemnified Party may file during the Notice Period,
         at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, any motion,
         answer or other pleading that the Indemnified Party may deem necessary
         or appropriate to protect its interests and not irrevocably prejudicial
         to the Indemnifying Party (it being understood and agreed that, except
         as provided in Section 9.05(a)(iii), if an Indemnified Party takes any
         such action that is irrevocably prejudicial and conclusively causes a
         final adjudication that is materially adverse to the Indemnifying
         Party, the Indemnifying Party will be relieved of its obligations
         hereunder with respect to that portion of the Third Party Claim
         prejudiced




                                       56
<PAGE>   64


         by the Indemnified Party's action); provided, further, however, that,
         if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
         cooperate, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
         the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
         Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest or, if appropriate
         in the judgment of the Indemnified Party and related to the Third Party
         Claim, in making any counterclaim or cross-claim against any Person
         (other than the Indemnified Party). The Indemnified Party may
         participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third
         Party Claim assumed by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section
         9.05(a)(ii) and, except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
         Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
         such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
         Party may not assume the defense of the Third Party Claim if (1) the
         Persons against whom the claim is made, or any impleaded Persons,
         include both the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party, and (2)
         representation of both such Persons by the same counsel would be
         inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
         them, in which case any Indemnified Party shall have the right to
         defend the Third Party Claim and to employ counsel at the expense of
         the Indemnifying Party.

                  (iii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the
         Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party
         intends to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim,
         or if the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to diligently
         prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party
         fails to give any notice whatsoever within the Notice Period, then the
         Indemnified Party will have the right (but not the obligation) to
         defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the
         Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings
         will be diligently prosecuted by the Indemnified Party to a final
         conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party. The
         Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and
         proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided,
         however, that, if requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
         Party shall cooperate, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
         Party, with the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting the
         Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is contesting, or, if
         appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim in question, in making
         any counterclaim or cross-claim against any Person (other than the
         Indemnifying Party).

                  (iv) Notwithstanding Section 9.05(a)(iii), if the Indemnifying
         Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that the
         Indemnifying Party disputes its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
         Party against the Third Party Claim, and if such dispute is resolved
         pursuant to Section 9.05(c) in favor of the Indemnifying Party, the
         Indemnifying Party will not be required to bear the costs and expenses
         of the Indemnified Party's defense pursuant to Section 9.05(a)(iii) or
         of the Indemnifying Party's participation therein at the Indemnified
         Party's request, and the Indemnified Party will reimburse the
         Indemnifying Party in full for all such costs and expenses. The
         Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
         settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
         9.05(a)(iii), but the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and
         expenses with respect thereto if such participation is not at the
         request of the Indemnified Party.




                                       57
<PAGE>   65


         (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party that is not a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver an Indemnity Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party
specifying the nature of and specific basis for the claim and, to the extent
then feasible, the amount or the estimated amount of the claim. The failure by
any Indemnified Party to give timely notice referred to in the preceding
sentence shall not impair such Person's rights hereunder except to the extent
that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been irreparably prejudiced
thereby. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
30 days following its receipt of the Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying
Party disputes its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the
claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder.

         (c) If the Indemnifying Party timely disputes its liability with
respect to a claim described in a Claim Notice or an Indemnity Notice, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed promptly and in good
faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute within 60 days following receipt
of the Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice and, if such dispute is not resolved
through negotiations during such 60-day period, it shall be resolved pursuant to
arbitration pursuant to the then effective Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law.

         (d) Except where liability is disputed pursuant to Section 9.05(c), the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any liability to the Indemnified
Party within 30 days following its receipt of a Claim Notice or an Indemnity
Notice, or on such later date (i) in the case of a Third Party Claim, as the
Indemnified Party suffers Losses in respect of the Third Party Claim, or (ii) in
the case of an Indemnity Notice in which the amount of the claim is estimated,
promptly after any Losses in respect of such claim are actually incurred by the
Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnified Party is not paid in full for
its claim in a timely manner after the Indemnifying Party's obligation to
indemnify and the amount thereof has been determined, the amount due shall bear
interest from the date that the Indemnifying Party received the Claim Notice or
the Indemnity Notice until paid at the Applicable Rate, and in addition to any
other rights it may have against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to set-off the unpaid amount of such claim against any
amounts owed by it to the Indemnifying Party.

         (e) Any estimated amount of a claim submitted in a Claim Notice or an
Indemnity Notice shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim, and
the giving of a Claim Notice when an Indemnity Notice is properly due, or the
giving of an Indemnity Notice when a Claim Notice is properly due, shall not
impair such Indemnified Party's rights hereunder except to the extent that an
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been irreparably prejudiced thereby.
Notice of any claim comprised in part of Third Party Claims and claims that are
not Third Party Claims may be given pursuant to either Section 9.05(a) or
Section 9.05(b).

         9.06. Survival of Representations; Indemnity Periods. Notwithstanding
any right of Buyer (whether or not exercised) to investigate the Business or any
right of any party (whether or not exercised) to investigate the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement,
Sellers have, on the one hand, and Buyer has, on the other hand, the right to
rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
other contained in this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement made by S & W and Buyer respectively will survive the Closing (a)
indefinitely with respect to matters





                                       58
<PAGE>   66


covered by Section 2.04, Section 3.01 and Section 4.01, (b) until 60 days after
the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including all periods
of extension, whether automatic or permissive) with respect to matters covered
by Section 3.05, Section 3.07, Section 3.13 and Section 3.22 and (c) until the
expiration of eighteen calendar months from the Closing Date in the case of all
other representations and warranties, except that:

                  (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
         would otherwise terminate in accordance with clause (b) or clause (c)
         above shall survive if a Claim Notice or an Indemnity Notice shall have
         been given on or prior to such termination date, until the related
         claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as
         provided in this Section 9;

                  (ii) in the event of intentional misrepresentation or fraud in
         the making of any representation or warranty, or intentional, willful
         or reckless nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant in this Agreement,
         all representations, warranties, covenants and agreements that are the
         subject of the intentional misrepresentation, fraud, willful or
         reckless nonfulfillment or breach, shall survive until 60 days after
         the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including all
         periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive) with respect to
         matters covered thereby; and

                  (iii) covenants and agreements to be performed after the
         Closing Date will survive the Closing for the term specified therein,
         or, if no term is specified, indefinitely.

         9.07. Limitations of Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 9 to the contrary, (a) Sellers' liability for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be (i) limited in the case of claims other than those related to
(A) the letters of credit as shown on Schedule 5.16(b) with respect to the
Project Rejected Contracts or financial guarantees in favor of insurance
carriers or (B) the Canadian Transfer, to the Indemnity Deposit, (ii) limited in
the case of claims related to the letters of credit as shown on Schedule 5.16(b)
with respect to the Project Rejected Contracts or financial guarantees in favor
of insurance carriers, to the LC Deposit, or (iii) unlimited in the case of
claims related to the Canadian Transfer, provided that any such claim shall be
satisfied first from the Canadian Consideration, and (b) Buyer's liability for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be limited to the sum of Twenty Five
Million Dollars ($25,000,000).

10. GENERAL

         10.01. Schedules. The Schedules and all Exhibits and documents referred
to in or attached to this Agreement are integral parts of this Agreement as if
fully set forth herein and all statements appearing therein shall be deemed to
be representations. Nothing in the Schedules shall be deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless the
Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity.

         10.02. Tax Effect. None of the parties (nor such parties' counsel or
accountants) has made or is making in this Agreement any representation to any
other party (or such party's counsel or accountants) concerning any of the Tax
effects or consequences on the other party of the transactions provided for in
this Agreement. Each party represents that it has obtained, or




                                       59
<PAGE>   67


may obtain, independent Tax advice with respect thereto and upon which it, if so
obtained, has solely relied.

         10.03. Reproduction of Documents. This Agreement and all documents
relating hereto, including consents, waivers and modifications which may
hereafter be executed, the documents delivered at the Closing, and financial
statements, certificates and other information previously or hereafter furnished
to any party may be reproduced by any party by any photographic, photostatic,
microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic or other similar process and the
parties may destroy any original documents so reproduced. The parties stipulate
that any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original
itself in any judicial, arbitral or administrative proceeding (whether or not
the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made in
the ordinary course of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or further
reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.

         10.04. Time of Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance of
this Agreement. This Section may be waived only in a writing expressly referring
hereto.

         10.05. Consents, Approvals and Discretion. Except as herein expressly
provided to the contrary, whenever this Agreement requires any consent or
approval to be given by any party that is not in such party's sole discretion or
any party must or may exercise discretion (other than its sole discretion), such
consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and such
discretion shall be reasonably exercised.

         10.06. Choice of Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 10.06, this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
such state's conflicts of laws rules. Each of the Parties hereby (a) submits to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware for
purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the Transaction and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection to the laying of venue of any such proceeding brought in such
court and any claim that such court is an inconvenient forum or (b) with respect
to the Bankruptcy Cases and issues relating thereto that are properly within the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Bankruptcy Court for such purposes and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection to the laying of venue of any such
proceeding brought in such Bankruptcy Court and any claim that such Bankruptcy
Court is an inconvenient forum; provided, however, that if the Bankruptcy Court
abstains or otherwise determines not to hear such proceeding, then the
provisions of clause (a) above shall apply.

         10.07. Benefit; Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal
representatives, successors and assigns. No party may assign this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided, however, that
Buyer may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate of Buyer.

         10.08. No Third Party Beneficiary. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including provisions regarding employee and employee benefit matters)
are intended solely for the benefit of the parties, Buyer's Indemnified Persons,
Sellers' Indemnified Persons, and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, and are not intended to confer third-party



                                       60
<PAGE>   68


beneficiary rights upon any other Person. Any reference in this Agreement to one
or more Employee Benefit Plans of Buyer or S & W includes provisions, if any, in
such plans permitting their termination or amendment and any covenant in this
Agreement to provide benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan shall not be
deemed or construed to limit Buyer's right to terminate or amend such plan of
Buyer in accordance with its terms.

         10.09. Waiver of Breach, Right or Remedy. The waiver by any party of
any breach or violation by another party of any provision of this Agreement or
of any right or remedy of the waiving party in this Agreement (a) shall not
waive or be construed to waive any subsequent breach or violation of the same
provision, (b) shall not waive or be construed to waive a breach or violation of
any other provision, and (c) shall be in writing and may not be presumed or
inferred from any party's conduct. Except as expressly provided otherwise in
this Agreement no remedy conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive
of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be in addition to every
other remedy granted in this Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity, by statute or otherwise. The election of any one or more remedies by a
party shall not constitute a waiver of the right of such waiving party to pursue
other available remedies. In addition to any other rights and remedies any party
may have at law or in equity for breach of this Agreement, each party shall be
entitled to seek an injunction to enforce the provisions of this Agreement.

         10.10. Notices. Any notice, demand or communication required, permitted
or desired to be given hereunder shall be deemed effectively given if given in
writing (a) on the date tendered by personal delivery, (b) on the date received

Buyer with reasonable promptness any monies received by Sellers constituting or
in respect of the Assets, Assumed Contracts and Assumed Liabilities. Buyer shall
remit to S & W with reasonable promptness any monies received by Buyer
constituting or in respect of the Excluded Assets, Rejected Contracts (except
Project Rejected Contracts to the extent Buyer has made unreimbursed payments
under letters of credit related thereto), Completed Contracts and Excluded
Liabilities. If any Person determines that funds previously paid or credited to
any Seller or the Business in respect of services rendered prior to the Closing
Date have resulted in an overpayment or must be repaid, Sellers shall be
responsible for the repayment of said monies (and the defense of such actions),
except to the extent that the repayment obligation was an Assumed Liability. If
Buyer suffers any deduction to or offset against amounts due Buyer of funds
previously paid or credited to any Seller or the Business in respect of services
rendered prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall immediately pay to Buyer the
amounts so billed or offset upon demand, except to the extent that such amounts
represent billings in excess of cost and revenues recognized under the Assumed
Contracts. Any amounts due Buyer by Sellers, or due Sellers by Buyer, may be
offset against monies or other funds held by the party entitled to payment of
such amounts.

         10.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held or
determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future
law, and if the rights or obligations of any party under this Agreement will not
be materially and adversely affected thereby: (a) such provision will be fully
severable; (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and
will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by
its severance herefrom; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

         10.13. Entire Agreement; Counterparts; Amendment. This Agreement,
together with the Sale Order (but excluding Exhibit B to the Sale Order),
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous contracts, agreements and understandings
and constitutes the entire agreement of whatsoever kind or nature existing
between or among the parties representing the subject matter of this Agreement
and no party shall be entitled to benefits other than those specified herein. As
between or among the parties, any oral or written representation, agreement or
statement not expressly incorporated herein, whether given prior to or on the
Effective Date, shall be of no force and effect unless and until made in writing
and signed by the parties on or after the Effective Date. The representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain
in full force and effect as provided in Article 9, and shall survive the
execution and delivery of all other agreements, instruments or other documents
described, referenced or contemplated herein (including any deed, assignment,
transfer or conveyance to Buyer) and shall not be merged herewith or therewith.
Each representation, warranty and covenant contained in this Agreement has
independent significance and if any party has breached any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists
another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter
(regardless of the relative level of specificity) that such party has not
breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach
of the first representation, warranty or covenant. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each and all of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same
instrument. This Agreement may not be amended except in a written instrument
executed the parties.

         10.14. Drafting. No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted
for or against any Person on the basis that such Person was the draftsman of
such provision, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Person by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

         10.15. Confidentiality. The provisions of the confidentiality agreement
between Buyer and Sellers dated June 12, 2000 are hereby incorporated by this
reference as if fully set forth herein, and shall apply and remain in full force
and effect through the Closing Date.

         10.16. Publicity. No party to this Agreement shall prior to the
Closing, without prior consultation with the other parties to the extent
practicable under the circumstances taking into account applicable laws and
stock exchange requirements, make any public disclosure with respect to the
Transaction, any negotiations or discussions concerning the Transaction or the
existence of this Agreement.
