Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 3.02, without interest.
                ------------

                  (d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this

Agreement to the contrary, each of the shares ("APPRAISAL SHARES") of
                                                ----------------

converted into the Merger Price as provided in Section 3.01(c), but rather
                                               ---------------
the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair
market value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262;
provided that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of any of such holder's
Appraisal Shares shall cease and each of such holder's Appraisal Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Price

               ---------------

                  Section 3.02  Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent.
                                ------------------------      ------------
Parent shall appoint JPMorgan Trust Company, N.A. or another paying agent
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "PAYING AGENT") for
                                                       ------------
the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates
representing Company Common Stock. Parent shall take all steps necessary to
enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent
immediately following the Effective Time all the cash necessary to pay for
the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash
pursuant to Section 3.01 and the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock
            ------------
Options, Company SARs and Company Performance Shares as set forth in Section
                                                                     -------

----                                                  -------------
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Paying Agent
shall invest any cash deposited with the Paying Agent by Parent as directed
by Parent; provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect
the Merger Consideration payable to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock entitled to receive such consideration, or the consideration to be
paid to the holders of the Company Stock Options, Company SARs and Company
Performance Shares as set forth in Section 3.03, and Parent shall promptly
                                   ------------
provide additional funds to Paying Agent for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company SARs and
Company Performance Shares entitled to receive such consideration in the
amount of any such losses. Any interest or income produced by such
investment shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be
payable to Parent.

                  (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable
                      ------------------
after the Effective Time, but in no event later than three Business Days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the "CERTIFICATES") whose shares were converted into the right to
            ------------
receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01, (1) a letter of
                                         ------------
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other

                                    -8-


provisions as are reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company)
and (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01, and the
                                                  ------------
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at
                        ------------
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01. No interest shall be paid or
                                ------------
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

                  (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.

upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's
                         -------  -------
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made
by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. After the Effective Time there shall be

                  (f) Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents or
liabilities incurred since September 30, 2004 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any material liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that, individually or

                  (a) The Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first
published or sent or delivered to the Company stockholders or at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the

the SEC thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or
Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the
foregoing documents.

                  (b) The Company has provided Parent with the most recent
draft of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year of the
Company ended December 31, 2004 (the "Company 2004 Form 10-K").
                                      ----------------------

                  (c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect:

                      (i)   the Company 2004 Form 10-K and the other reports
filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange
Act on or after the date of this Agreement but on or prior to the Closing
Date (the "Company Future SEC Filings") will not, on
           --------------------------

                                    -17-


the date they are filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

                      (ii)  the consolidated financial statements of the
Company, including the notes thereto, included or incorporated by reference
in the Company Future SEC Filings will be prepared in accordance with GAAP
and Regulation S-X of the SEC as in effect on the date of filing such
reports (except in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q or Form 8-K of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and will
fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows
for the periods shown (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the
absence of footnotes and normal year-end audit adjustments);

                      (iii) the consolidated financial statements of the
Company included in the Company 2004 Form 10-K will be accompanied by an
opinion, which will not be subject to any qualification or limitation,
issued by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm;

                      (iv)  the Company Future SEC Filings will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder;

                      (v)   to the Company's knowledge, there is no reason why
the Certifications required to be filed with the Company 2004 Form 10-K
cannot be filed without material qualification or exception;

                      (vi)  to the Company's knowledge, (A) the Company's
management will conclude that the Company's internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004 based on the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework and (B) the
management report on internal control over financial reporting included in
the Company 2004 Form 10-K ("Management Report") will not describe any
                             -----------------
"material weaknesses" as defined in the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board's Auditing Standard No. 2, as in effect as of the date hereof
("Auditing Standard No. 2"), in the design or operation of the Company's
  -----------------------
internal control over financial reporting; and

                      (vii) to the Company's knowledge, the attestation report
by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm with respect
to the Management Report included in the Company 2004 Form 10-K will concur
in all material respects with management's assessment included in the
Management Report and will conclude that the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee on
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.

                                    -18-


         For the avoidance of doubt, the Company acknowledges that a
statement of the existence of one or more "material weaknesses" as defined
in Auditing Standard No. 2 with respect to the Company's internal control
over financial reporting contained in the Management Report, or in the
attestation by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm
with respect to the Management Report, will be deemed to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, irrespective of whether the Company had knowledge
thereof as of the date of this Agreement.

Subsidiary has filed, or has caused to be filed on its behalf, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it, except to the extent any failure to

                                ------------------
or as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or in the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or
bound by any Contract (a) with respect to the employment of any directors,
executive officers or employees, or with any consultants that are natural
Persons, involving the payment of salary and cash bonus having a value of
$200,000 or more (or its equivalent in foreign currency) per annum; (b) that

Regulation S-K of the SEC), whether or not filed as an exhibit to the
Company SEC Documents; (c) that contains an annual minimum purchase
obligation of $750,000 or more or that requires annual payments by or to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary of $750,000 or more (in each case
excluding purchase orders in the ordinary course of business); (d) that
limits the ability of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
compete in any line of business, in any geographic area or with any Person,
or that requires referrals of business or exclusive dealing and, in each
case, which limitation or requirement would reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole; (e)
that would prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation
of any of the Transactions; or (f) with respect to supplier or customer
contracts required to be disclosed under (b) and (c) of this Section 4.11,
                                                             ------------
that provide a third party a right to terminate or exercise any other
material right (such as the right to terminate exclusivity or the right to

of the type described in this Section 4.11 (collectively referred to herein
                              ------------

Company, and to the knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto,
except to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their
terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has,
and to the knowledge of the Company, none of the other parties thereto have,
violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no
event or condition exists, which with or without notice, lapse of time or
both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any Company
Contract, except in each case for those violations and defaults that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents or the Company Disclosure Letter and except for matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, to the Company's knowledge, during the
period from September 30, 2004 through the date of this Agreement no

any severance, termination or change in control agreements or arrangements

Agreements covering only employees in the United States ("U.S. BENEFIT PLANS

                  Section 4.13  ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments.
                                -------------------------------------------
(a) With respect to All Benefit Plans and Agreements, the Company Disclosure
Letter contains a list of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")) ("COMPANY PENSION PLANS"), "employee welfare benefit
          -----      ---------------------
plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company Benefit
Plans maintained, or contributed to, by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employees, officers or
directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (determined, for this
purpose only, without regard to the exception in ERISA Section 4(b)(4) for
plans maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of
nonresident aliens). Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms, applicable Law and any
applicable collective bargaining agreement, other than instances of
noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of (1)
each Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit
Plan, a description thereof), (2) the most recent annual report on Form 5500
filed with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Company Benefit
Plan (if any such report was required), (3) the most recent determination
letter (or in the case of a prototype plan, the most recent IRS opinion
letter) for each U.S. Benefit Plan and Agreement intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, (4) the most recent summary plan
description for each Company Benefit Plan for which such summary plan
description is required, and (5) each trust agreement and group annuity
contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan.

                  (b) With respect to any U.S. Benefit Plans and Agreements,
except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or in the Company SEC
Documents, no Company Pension Plan, other than any Company Pension Plan that
is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
(a "COMPANY MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLAN"), had, as of the respective last
    ----------------------------------
annual valuation date for each such Company Pension Plan, an "unfunded
benefit liability" (as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of
ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions that have been furnished to Parent.
None of the Company Pension Plans has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code), whether or not waived. Each U.S. Benefit Plan and Agreement that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (or in the
case of a prototype plan, the most recent IRS opinion letter) to that effect
and each such plan complies in all material respects in form and in
operation with the requirements of the Code and meets the requirements of a
"qualified plan"

                                    -22-


under Section 401(a) of the Code. To the Company's knowledge, no event has
occurred or circumstances exist that will or could give rise to
disqualification or loss of tax-exempt status of any such plan or agreement.
To the Company's knowledge, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any
officer of the Company or any of its Company Subsidiary or, any of the
Company Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, including the Company
Pension Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator
thereof, or any fiduciary, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as
such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code).
None of such Company Benefit Plans and trusts has been terminated, nor to
the Company's knowledge has there been any "reportable event" (as that term
is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan during the last five years. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal"
(as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of
ERISA) with respect to any Company Multiemployer Pension Plan during the
last five years.

                  (c) With respect to any U.S. Benefit Plans and Agreements
that are employee welfare benefit plans, except as disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter, no such Company Benefit Plan is funded through a "welfare
benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) and
each such Company Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as such term
is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) materially complies with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code, except in such
instances in which noncompliance, individually and in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) With respect to U.S. Benefit Plans and Agreements,
other than payments that may be made to the Persons listed in the Company
Disclosure Letter or disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, any amount that
could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property)
as a result of the Merger or any other Transaction by any employee, officer
or director of the Company or any of its affiliates who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination agreement, other
compensation arrangement or Company Benefit Plan currently in effect would
not be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

                  (e) With respect to All Benefit Plans and Agreements,
except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or in the Company SEC
Documents, the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do
not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions and
compliance with the terms hereof will not, (1) entitle any employee, officer
or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to severance pay, (2)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or (3)
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.

                  (f) With respect to All Benefit Plans and Agreements,
except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, (1) other than routine
claims for benefits submitted by or on behalf of participants or
beneficiaries (including alternate payees in connection with qualified

                                    -23-


domestic relations orders as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code), no
claim, legal proceeding or investigation by a Governmental Entity is
pending, or to the Company's knowledge, is threatened, (2) the Company and
each Company Subsidiary have made all contributions due under each Company
Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement in accordance with local Law and past practice, (3) the
liabilities of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as of the date of
this Agreement have been appropriately reflected in all material respects on
the relevant financial statements in accordance with local Law, past
practice, and generally accepted accounting principles in each jurisdiction,

other Person with further access, electronic or otherwise, to any

                                                             ------------
any other provisions contained in this Agreement, if prior to the date the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained the Company receives an unsolicited
Company Takeover Proposal and the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that (i)
the Company Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a
transaction meeting the requirements of the definition of "Superior Company
Proposal" and (ii) failing to take such action would be inconsistent with
the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders
under applicable Law, then, subject to providing at least two Business Days
prior written notice to Parent, the Company may (i) furnish information with
respect to the Company to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal
and its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 7.02) and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
           ------------
(including solicitation of a revised Company Takeover Proposal) with such
Person and its Representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.

shall (i) withdraw or propose publicly to withdraw the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement
or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the

                                    -33-


foregoing, if the Company Board receives an unsolicited Superior Company
Proposal and as a result thereof the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that it is
necessary to do so in order to comply with their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company Board may withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement and, in connection
therewith, approve or recommend such Superior Company Proposal.

                  (e) The Company shall within 48 hours after its receipt of
any Company Takeover Proposal notify Parent of such Company Takeover
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Company Takeover
Proposal, excluding the identity of the acquiring party. In connection with
any determination by the Company Board that a Company Takeover Proposal is a
Superior Company Proposal, the Company shall within 24 hours after the
making of such determination provide Parent with a written summary in
reasonable detail of the reasons for such determination.

                  (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit
                                                ------------
the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law. Any action taken by the Company or the
Company Board in accordance with this Section 6.02(f) shall be deemed not to
                                      ---------------
be a modification of the Company Board's approval or recommendation of the
Merger and this Agreement.

reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The Parent shall promptly provide

filed with the SEC. At the earliest practical date following clearance of
the Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to prepare and file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement and
to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders, in each case at the earliest practicable date following the
filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. If at any time prior
to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval there shall occur any event

Section 7.01(b) notwithstanding any action taken by the Company Board pursuant
---------------

Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to Parent's and its lenders'
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time to all its properties, books and
contracts and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of the Company Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. Any such investigation shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would violate or contravene any Law, order, judgment,
decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. To the
extent practicable, the parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.02

13, 2004 between the Company and Parent (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").
                                              -------------------------

                  Section 7.03  Best Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the
                                --------------------------
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, unless, to
the extent permitted by Section 6.02(d), the Company Board approves or
                        ---------------
recommends a Superior Company Proposal, each of the parties shall use its
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other
Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and
the making of all

                                    -35-

to obtain an approval or waiver from, to secure the expiration of any
mandatory waiting periods of or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this

purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the

                       ---------------
efforts to obtain all necessary consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions shall not be
construed to require Parent or Sub to sell, divest, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or agree to sell, divest, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of, any assets or businesses, including any assets or businesses of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or to enter into or agree to enter
into any compulsory licensing or similar arrangement, in order to obtain
approval, clearance or expiration of any waiting periods under the HSR Act
or any other antitrust or competition Law and (y) the Company and its
Representatives shall not be prohibited under this Section 7.03(a) from
                                                   ---------------
taking any action permitted by Section 6.02.
                               ------------

                  (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent or Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (1) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or
any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect or (2) any failure by it to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.

                  (c) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any
action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing that
would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent Parent's or Sub's
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Merger or the other Transactions.

                  Section 7.04  Employment, Compensation and Benefit Plans.
                                ------------------------------------------
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their respective terms
(as in effect on the date of this Agreement), the Company's written
employment, severance and termination agreements with individual employees
set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter.

                  (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA but without regard to Section 4(b)(4) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including but not
limited to any severance plan), for all purposes, including determining
eligibility to participate or to receive benefits and vesting, service with
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or predecessor entity (and any other
service credited by the Company under similar severance plans), shall be
treated as service with Parent or any of its

                                    -36-


Subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits.

                  (c) With respect to each U.S. Benefit Plan and Agreement
that is an employee welfare benefit plan, Parent shall waive, or cause to be
waived, any pre-existing condition, evidence of insurability, waiting
period, continuing-course-of-treatment, or actively-at-work requirement
limitation under any employee welfare benefit plan, as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(other than the Surviving Corporation) in which each employee who was an
employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time (an "AFFECTED EMPLOYEE") (and their eligible dependents) will
                    -----------------
be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, with respect
to those Affected Employees (and their eligible dependents) except, with
respect to any Person, to the extent that such requirements would have been
applicable to such Person under the comparable employee welfare benefit plan
of the Company or Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount
of all expenses incurred by each Affected Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such year's deductible, co-payment and
"out-of-pocket" maximum limitations under the relevant employee welfare
benefit plans, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

                  (d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent under clauses (a) through (c) of this Section 7.04, shall not be
                                             ------------
terminated, amended, repealed, revoked or modified in any manner which will
adversely affect any director, officer or other person to whom such Sections
apply without the consent of the affected director, officer or other person
(it being expressly agreed that each director, officer or other person to
whom such Sections apply shall be third-party beneficiaries of such
Sections).

                  (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7.04,
                                                             ------------
from and after the Effective Time and subject to the terms of any applicable
collective bargaining agreement or any employment agreement existing as of
the date hereof, the Affected Employees shall be deemed employees at will
and nothing expressed or implied herein will obligate Parent or its
Subsidiaries to provide continued employment to any Affected Employee for a
specified period of time following the Effective Time.

                  Section 7.05  Indemnification; Directors' and Officers'
                                -----------------------------------------

                  Insurance.  (a) The certificate of incorporation and the
                  ---------
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and director exculpation as are set
forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws as in effect at the date
hereof (to the extent consistent with applicable Law), which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the persons who at any time
prior to the Effective Time were entitled to indemnification, advancement of
expenses or exculpation under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws in
respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the Transactions), unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

                                    -37-


                  (b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
 -------------------
fees and expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and pertaining
to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at
or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring
in connection with (1) the approval of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Merger and the other Transactions or (2) serving as fiduciary under
any Company Benefit Plan) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or
have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof by the
Company pursuant to the Company Charter, Company Bylaws and indemnification
agreements in existence on the date hereof with any current or former
directors or officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

                  (c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
obtained, and shall pay the full lump sum premium with respect to, policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing an aggregate
coverage amount of $25 million issued by the Company's current directors'
and officers' liability insurance carriers or other insurance carriers with
ratings by A.M. Best & Co. equal to or higher than the ratings of such
current insurance carriers (the "TAIL INSURANCE"). At least 10 Business Days
                                 --------------
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Company evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the Tail Insurance will be in
full force and effect as of the Effective Time. The Tail Insurance shall
have terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the insured
parties than the directors' and officers' liability insurance currently in
effect for the Company. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained (1) the Tail Insurance and (2) a
letter of credit in an amount of $2,500,000 for the purpose of funding the
trust established pursuant to indemnification agreements in existence on the
date hereof with the Company's directors and officers. Neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall take any action to cause the Tail Insurance
to be modified, terminated or cancelled prior to the end of such six-year
period after the Effective Time.

                  (d) Parent shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Party may incur
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this
Section 7.05.
------------

                  (e) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, as the case may be, shall assume and agree to perform the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.
                              ------------
                                    -38-


                  (f) The provisions of this Section 7.05 (i) are intended
                                             ------------
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs and representatives, (ii) are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have by Law, contract or otherwise and (iii) shall
survive the consummation of the Merger.

                  Section 7.06  Fees and Expenses. Except as provided below,
                                -----------------

                                  ---------

         In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
statute, the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or
repeal the bylaws of the corporation; provided, however, that such
authorization shall not divest the stockholders of the power or limit the
power of the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the
corporation.

                                  ARTICLE 7
                                  ---------

         Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware, as the bylaws of the corporation may provide. The books of the
corporation may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such place or
places as may be designated from time to time by the board of directors or
in the bylaws of the corporation. Election of directors need not be by

         A Director of this corporation shall not be personally liable to
the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except that this Article 9 shall not eliminate
or limit a Director's liability (i) for any breach of the Director's duty of
loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions
not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 or the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the Director derived
an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is
amended after approval by the shareholders of this Article 9 to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a Director of the corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as so amended from time to time.

         Any repeal or modification of this Article 9 shall not increase the
personal liability of any Director of this corporation for any act or
occurrence taking place prior to such repeal or modification, or otherwise
adversely affect any right or protection of a Director of the corporation
existing at the tine of such repeal or modification.

         The provisions of this Article 9 shall not be deemed to limit or
preclude indemnification of a Director by the corporation for any liability
of a Director which has not been eliminated by the provisions of this
Article 9.

         Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this
corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of
equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application
in a summary way of this corporation or of any creditor or stockholder
thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for
this corporation under the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the
Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any
receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of
section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code, order a meeting of the
creditors or class of creditors and/or of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of this corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such
manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing
three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors and/or of the
stockholders or class of stockholders of this corporation, as the case may
be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this
corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said
compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned
by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all
the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class
of stockholders, of this corporation, as the case may be, and also on this
corporation.

                                 ARTICLE 11
