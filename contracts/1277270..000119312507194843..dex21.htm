2.2 Closing; Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware
Law") (the time of such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing
by the Company and Parent prior to the Closing (as defined below), and
specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") on the
Closing Date (as herein defined). The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 2765 Sand Hill Road,
Menlo Park, California, at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, September 14, 2007, or at
such other time, date and location as the Parties hereto agree in writing (the
"Closing Date").



 

8 2.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall be those of the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall be the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

2.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

2.4.1 As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Merger Sub or the Company, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to read the same as
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.7 hereof, until thereafter amended
in accordance with Delaware Law and such certificate of incorporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that as of the Effective Time such certificate of
incorporation shall provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation is
"AccessLine Holdings, Inc."

2.4.2 As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Merger Sub or the Company, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated to read the same as the bylaws of

2.6 Intentionally omitted.

2.7 Adjustment to Number of Parent Shares.

2.7.1 If the Closing Net Working Capital is less than ($3,729,609) (after
giving effect to the $229,609 principal payment to be made by the Company
under the BlueCrest Loan Agreement prior to the Closing Date) (the "Target
Working Capital Amount"), the number of Parent Shares issuable hereunder shall
be reduced by a number of Parent Shares valued at the Per Share Value in the
amount by which the Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target
Working Capital Amount, on a dollar for dollar basis.

2.7.2 Within five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to the Parent an unaudited balance sheet of the Company,
which shall also include a statement of Company Indebtedness, the Montgomery

all accounts payable, (ii) all capital lease obligations, (iii) all accrued
liabilities, including any unpaid Company Merger Expenses, and (iv) deferred

if they constitute both an account payable and an accrued liability). For the
purposes of clarity, Closing Net Working Capital shall not include amounts
owed pursuant to the BlueCrest Loan Agreement, to Counsel Corporation or
to Catch Curve, Inc. or the Montgomery Payment. The Closing Net Working
Capital calculation shall be prepared using the same accounting methods,
standards, policies, practices, classifications, estimation methodologies,

transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any
shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing
shares of Company Capital Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled.

2.10 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of the

to take all such lawful and necessary or desirable action. Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

of the appraised value of such shares of Company Capital Stock held by them
in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any Tax Law. Any amounts withheld shall be paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or

month periods ending December 31, 2007, June 30, 2008, December 31, 2008 and
June 30, 2009 (each an "Earn-out Period") based on a percentage of the Earn-
out Goals met for each such Earn-out Period such that the percentage of
the Earn-out Shares earned for each such Earn-out Period will be equal to the

period shall be measured separately and no cumulative effect shall be carried

the Bridge Lenders and the Company Key Employees that until June 30, 2009

or withdraw resources from the Surviving Corporation with the intent to

continue to operate the Companys business in and through the Surviving
Corporation, and to cause all opportunities presented to Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries related to the Companys business to be directed and made
available to the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that Parent shall agree in writing for the benefit of the Bridge Lenders
and the Company Key Employees that all of the Earn-out Shares pertaining to
Earn-out Periods that have not yet expired shall be unconditionally paid no
later than 30 days after the end of each such Earn-out Period without regard
to the other provisions of this Section 2.14, then the other provisions of
this Section 2.14 (including the restrictions set forth in the first sentence
of this Section 2.14.4) shall terminate and be of no further force or effect.

2.14.5 Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Bridge Lender Representative,
within thirty (30) days after the expiration of each Earn-out Period, a
statement setting forth its good faith calculations of the Surviving
Corporations revenues and gross profit for such Earn-out Period (each, an
"Earn-out Statement"). Revenue shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP as
applied by the Company prior to the Closing, and "gross profit" shall equal
revenue less network expenses. If the Surviving Corporation does not meet at
least 100% of the Earn-out Goals for an Earn-out Period such that all Earn-
out Shares payable for such Earn-out Period will be paid, Parent shall give
the Bridge Lender Representative and its accountants and other appropriate
personnel such assistance and access to the books and records and relevant
personnel of the Surviving Corporation as such accountants or other personnel
may reasonably request during normal business hours in order to enable the
Bridge Lender Representative to review the Earn-out Statement and analyze the
underlying information. The Bridge Lender Representative shall keep all
information obtained from any such access confidential, except as is
reasonably necessary or appropriate to contest the Earn-out Statement in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

2.14.6 The Earn-out Statement for a particular Earn-out Period shall be final
and binding on Parent, the Bridge Lenders and the Company Key Employees
unless the Bridge Lender Representative shall, within fifteen (15) Business
Days following delivery of the Earn-out Statement, deliver to Parent a written
notice of objection (an "Objection Notice") with respect to such Earn-out
Statement. The Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis
for the dispute, including the data that forms the basis thereof, as well  



 

12  as the amount in dispute. If an Objection Notice is timely delivered to
Parent, Parent and the Bridge Lender Representative shall consult with each
other with respect to the dispute and attempt in good faith to resolve the
dispute. If Parent and the Bridge Lender Representative are unable to reach
agreement within thirty days after delivery of the Objection Notice, either
Parent or the Bridge Lender Representative may refer any unresolved disputes
to Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if such firm is unavailable or unwilling to
undertake this engagement, such other independent auditing firm agreed to
between Parent and the Bridge Lender Representative (the "Independent
Accounting Firm"). The Independent Accounting Firm shall be directed to render
a written report as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within thirty
days of the Independent Accounting Firms engagement regarding the dispute.
The resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
final and binding on Parent, the Bridge Lenders and the Company Key Employees.
If the Independent Accounting Firm findings result in at least a 10% increase
in the number of Earn-out Shares payable for such Earn-out Period, Parent
shall pay all fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm incurred in
connection with the Objection Notice. Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be paid by Parent and the number of Earn-out Shares payable with respect
to such Earn-out Period shall be reduced by a number equal to 50% of such
fees and expenses divided by the Per Share Value.

2.15 Adjustments. All share numbers herein, including, but not limited to
the Per Share Value, the Parent Shares, the Earn-out Shares, the Bridge
Lender Escrow Shares and the Plan Participant Escrow Shares, shall be adjusted
to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock occurring after the date of this Agreement.

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Change. To the Companys knowledge, no event has occurred
or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time) would
reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a violation by the Company
or the Company Subsidiary of, or a failure on the part of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary to comply with, any Law, or may give rise under any Law to
any obligation on the part of the Company or the Company Subsidiary to

of funds, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to
any Employee.

3.11.9 There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract covering any

Article 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents and warrants to the Company as set
forth in this Article 4 subject to any exceptions expressly stated in the
disclosure schedule delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company dated as
of the date hereof (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"), that:

4.1 Organization of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent and Merger Sub (i)
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation; (ii) has the corporate or
other power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and property
and to carry on its business as now being conducted; and (iii) is duly
qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified would not result in a Parent Material Adverse
Change. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material violation of any
provisions of its respective certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws
or other organizational documents. 

4.2 Authority; Non-Contravention.

4.2.1 Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or other power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or other action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, subject only
to the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to Delaware Law. No vote
of Parents stockholders is required in connection with the consummation of
the transactions hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger
Sub in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating
to the rights of creditors generally and general principles of equity
regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law.

4.2.2 The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will
not, result in a termination, or breach or  



 

22  violation by Parent or Merger Sub of, or under (i) the certificate or
articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of Parent
or the certificate or articles of incorporation, or bylaws or other
organizational documents of Merger Sub, (ii) any Order or Law applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or assets, or (iii)
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under or impair Parents or
Merger Subs rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party
under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, or result in the creation of an Encumbrance on any of the
properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to, any material note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise, concession, or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or
Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective properties or assets are bound or affected. No consent, waiver or
approval of any Person, nor any notice to any Person, is required to be
obtained or made under any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, lease or
license to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party in connection with the
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement or the
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub.

4.2.3 No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with or notice to any Governmental Entity or other
Person is required to be obtained or made by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger, except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and for filings in
connection with any exemption from registration under U.S. federal or state
securities laws.

4.3 Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to Parents knowledge,
threatened in writing against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub), before any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator that seeks to
restrain or enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or which could reasonably be expected, either singularly or in the
aggregate with all such Actions, to result in a Parent Material Adverse Change
or negatively affect the ability of the Parties hereto to consummate the
Merger.

4.4 Adequacy of Financing. Parent has sufficient funds to satisfy its monetary
and other obligations under this Agreement, and such funds are not subject to
any financing or other contingencies.

4.5 Brokers and Finders Fees. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has incurred,
nor will any of them incur, directly or indirectly, any liability for
brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or any similar charges in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, except
for fees payable to Kaufman Bros L.P. Parent and Merger Sub are solely
responsible for payment of the fees to Kaufman Bros L.P.

4.6 Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no other
business activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated
by this Agreement.

4.7 Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and
$10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001. The Parent Shares
and Earn-out Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement will, upon such
issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable.

4.8 SEC Documents; Financial Statements. As of their respective filing dates,
each report, statement and other filing filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by Parent since the end of its most recent
fiscal year (collectively, the "Parent SEC Documents") complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, as applicable, and none of the Parent SEC Documents as of their
respective filing dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a Parent SEC
Document filed subsequently (but prior to the date hereof). Except as set
forth in any Parent SEC Document, the financial  



 

23  statements of Parent, including the notes thereto, included in the most
recent annual report on Form 10-K and each subsequent quarterly report on Form
10-Q, in each case as amended, if applicable, included in the Parent SEC
Documents (the "Parent Financial Statements") (i) complied as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their
respective dates, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each
other (except as may otherwise be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as
permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act), and (iii) present fairly in
all material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of
operations and cash flows of Parent as of the dates, and for the periods,
indicated therein (subject, in the case of interim period financial
statements, to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments).

4.9 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Parent (on a consolidated basis) has
no material Liabilities of any nature (matured or unmatured, fixed or
contingent) other than (i) those set forth or adequately provided for in the
most recent balance sheet included in Parents Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007 (the "Parent Balance Sheet"), (ii)
those incurred in the ordinary course of business and not required to be set
forth in the Parent Balance Sheet under GAAP, and (iii) those incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the Parent Balance Sheet Date and
consistent with past practice which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be likely to result in a Parent Material Adverse Change.

4.10 Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Parent (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) has unanimously approved this Agreement, the Merger, and
the issuance of the Parent Shares, the Earn-out Shares and the Other Shares.

4.11 Parents Due Diligence. Parent acknowledges that, except for the matters
that are expressly covered by the provisions of this Agreement, it is relying
on its own investigation and analysis in entering into this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent is an informed and sophisticated
participant in the transactions contemplated hereby and has undertaken such
investigation, and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and
information, as it has deemed necessary in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges that it is
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby without any representation
or warranty, express or implied, by the Company or any of its affiliates
or securityholders except as expressly set forth herein. In furtherance of
the foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, Parent acknowledges that no
representation or warranty, express or implied, of the Company or any of its
advisors or any of their respective affiliates, securityholders or
representatives, with respect to the Company, including (i) the information
provided by Montgomery and Co. LLC; (ii) any other information provided to
Parent; or (iii) any financial projection or forecast delivered to Parent
with respect to the revenues or profitability which may arise from the
operation of the Company either before or after the Closing Date, shall
(except as otherwise expressly represented to in this Agreement) form the
basis of any claim against the Company or any of its advisors or any of their
respective affiliates, securityholders or representatives with respect thereto
or with respect to any related matter. Parent has no knowledge of any facts
and/or circumstances that would make any of the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in Article 3 untrue or misleading.

Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors (including
any investment fund affiliated with such director that is a holder of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time), officers or employees
of the Company (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees") with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request
of the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time. Parent agrees that,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume, all rights of the
Company Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company as now in
effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Company
Indemnitees. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall pay any expenses of
any Company Indemnitee under this Section 6.7 as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the
extent required by applicable Law.

6.7.2 Each Company Indemnitee shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
control the defense of, including the investigation of, any litigation, claim
or proceeding (each, a "Claim") relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this Section 6.7 with counsel selected by the Company Indemnitee;
provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Corporation shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense and (ii) the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

6.7.3 In the event any Claim is asserted or made, any determination required
to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnitees conduct complies
with the standards set forth under applicable law, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of the Company, as the case may be, shall be made by independent
legal counsel selected by such Company Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to
Parent.

6.7.4 Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Indemnitees
shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, documents,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.



 

28 6.7.5 The Parties acknowledge that the Company has or will prior to the
Closing purchase a six-year "tail" policy extending the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance policy, and each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation agrees not to terminate or modify in a manner
adverse to the beneficiaries thereof such "tail" policy prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time.

6.7.6 The provisions of this Section 6.7 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

6.7.7 In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.7.8 The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.7 applies
without the consent of the affected Company Indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7).

6.8 Employee Benefits. Parent shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each
employee of the Company who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (a
"Continuing Employee") receives full credit (for all purposes, including
eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance
benefits) for service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the
extent the Company provides such past service credit under its employee
benefit plans) under each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs
and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary,
as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee becomes a participant;
provided, however, that no such service recognition shall result in any
duplication of benefits. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or relevant Subsidiary to, credit to Continuing
Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under
any applicable Company Employee Plan as of the Closing Date. With respect to
each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of any Continuing
Employees, subject only to any required approval of the applicable insurance
provider, if any, which approval Parent shall use all best efforts to obtain,
Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any
evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations under such plan, and (ii) cause each
Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid
by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company Employee Plan for the
plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable plan maintained
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

6.9 Intentionally omitted.

6.10 Expenses. Each Party hereto shall bear the costs and expenses incurred by
it in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including fees and disbursements of investment bankers, brokers, dealers,
finders, other financial advisors, attorneys and accountants (collectively
"Merger Expenses"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Merger is
consummated, all unpaid Company Merger Expenses shall be paid at the Closing.



 

29 6.11 Funds Flow. The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent within two
business days prior to the Closing, a memorandum of wire and payment
instructions regarding the payments to be made by Parent at the Closing
pursuant to Section 2.13 (the "Funds Flow Memorandum").

6.12 State Statutes. If any state takeover law shall become applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective Board of Directors or the Company and its Board of Directors, as

Article 9

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Escrow Fund. All Escrow Shares shall be deposited with an institution as
escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") selected by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, such deposits to constitute the Escrow Fund and
to be governed by the provisions set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate Parent (on behalf of itself
or any other Indemnified Person) for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the
indemnification obligations of the Bridge Lenders and the Incentive Plan
Participants, and for certain other payments expressly provided for in this
Article 9. Subject to Section 9.4, upon expiration of the Claims Period, all
remaining Escrow Shares and other property, if any, in the Escrow Fund shall
be released and paid to the Bridge Lenders and Incentive Plan Participants
based on their respective interests in the Escrow Fund. In addition, on the
first Business Day after the 180-day anniversary of the Effective Time, a
number of Escrow Shares (and any other property in the Escrow Fund that was
distributed with respect to such shares) equal to one third of the Escrow
Shares less any Escrow Shares delivered to Parent or the subject of
outstanding claims for Indemnifiable Damages made pursuant to an Officers
Certificate delivered prior to such 180-day anniversary shall be released
and paid to the Bridge Lenders and Incentive Plan Participants based on their
respective interests in the Escrow Fund. Any additional shares of Parent
Capital Stock or any other securities or property distributed with respect to
the Escrow Shares then forming part of the Escrow Fund, shall form part of
the Escrow Fund, be available to satisfy the indemnification obligations of
the Bridge Lenders and the Incentive Plan Participants, and be released along
with the release of the Escrow Shares with respect to which such additional
shares, securities or property were originally distributed. All such
additional shares, securities or property shall be valued at fair market value
at the time of payment to an Indemnified Person for purposes of paying any
Indemnifiable Damages.

9.2 Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 9,
the Bridge Lenders and the Incentive Plan Participants shall, severally and
not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its officers, directors,
agents and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may control
Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act (each of the foregoing being
referred to individually as an "Indemnified Person" and collectively as
"Indemnified Persons") from and against (a) any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs and expenses, including costs of investigation and defense and
reasonable legal fees and expenses arising from claims, demands, assertions of
liability or actual or threatened actions, suits or proceedings (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) resulting from or in
connection with (i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule) to
be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) any material
breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or agreements
made by the Company in this Agreement, (b) 50% of any fines imposed on and
actually paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as a result of Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, failing to obtain any
consent, approval or authorization identified in Section 3.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule prior to the Effective Time (provided that
such indemnification under this clause (b) shall be in lieu of any other
rights to indemnification any Indemnified Person may have under clause (a)
above or otherwise related to any such failure), and (c) the amount by which
Parent or the Surviving Corporation actually pays to any Bridge Lender that
did not consent to the terms of this Agreement (including such Bridge Lenders
agreement to receive the amounts payable to such Bridge Lender hereunder in
lieu of repayment of such Bridge Lenders Bridge Loan pursuant to its terms)
in satisfaction of such Bridge Lenders Bridge Loan more than the value of the
amounts that such Bridge Lender would have received under  



 

34  this Agreement (provided that such indemnification under this clause (c)
shall be in lieu of any other rights to indemnification any Indemnified
person may have related to being required to make such excess payment under
clause (a) above or otherwise), (collectively, net of any recoveries by the
Indemnified Persons under insurance policies or indemnities from third
parties, "Indemnifiable Damages"). For purposes of clarity, no Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to be indemnified hereunder if such recovery would
result in such Person recovering more than the amount of Indemnifiable Damages
actually incurred from all sources of recovery. The Escrow Fund shall
constitute security for such indemnity obligations, subject to the limitations
in this Agreement. If the Merger is consummated, recovery from the Escrow Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any failure of any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company in this Agreement to be true
and correct or any breach of or default in connection with any of the
covenants or agreements by the Company in this Agreement as aforesaid, the
liability of each Bridge Lender and each Incentive Plan Participant hereunder
shall be limited to such Persons interest in the Escrow Fund existing from
time to time except in the case of (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation
by the Company and (ii) any failure of any of the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.2, 3.6 and 3.13 of this Agreement to be
true and correct as aforesaid; provided that, in the case of (i) fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by the Company or (ii) any failure of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.2, 3.6 and 3.13 of this
Agreement to be true and correct as aforesaid, after the Indemnified Persons
have exhausted any amount in the Escrow Fund, each Bridge Lender and each
Incentive Plan Participant shall be liable only for such holders pro rata
portion (with such pro rata portion being equal to such Persons percentage of
the total number of Parent Shares issued to such Person in connection with
the Closing) of the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages resulting therefrom.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) in no event shall any
Bridge Lender or Incentive Plan Participant be liable hereunder for more than
such Persons interest in the Escrow Fund and the amount of Parent Shares
actually received by such Person from Parent pursuant to this Agreement, (b)
there shall be deducted from the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages an
amount equal to the amount of any Tax benefit realized by an Indemnified
Person in connection with such Indemnified Damages or any of the circumstances
giving rise thereto and (c) in no event shall there under any circumstances
be any liability for any Taxes (i) relating to the Company for any period
after the Closing Date or (ii) resulting from any act, transaction, omission
or election of Parent or the Company made or occurring after the Closing that
is not in the ordinary course of business.

9.3 Indemnifiable Damage Threshold; Other Limitations. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Person may receive
any shares or other property from the Escrow Fund in respect of any claim for
indemnification that is made pursuant to Section 9.2, except with respect to
breaches of the Companys representations and warranties in Sections 3.2, 3.6
or 3.13 or claims under Section 9.2(b) and (c), unless and until Indemnifiable
Damages in an aggregate amount greater than $250,000 (the "Escrow Threshold")
have been incurred, paid or properly accrued, in which case the Escrow
Threshold shall not limit the amount of Indemnifiable Damages that any
Indemnified Person is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article 9. In
determining the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages in respect of the failure
of any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any particular
date, any materiality standard contained in such representation or warranty
shall be disregarded. Except as otherwise required by law, any payments made
pursuant to this Article 9 shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase
price for all Tax purposes.

9.4 Claims Period. The period during which claims for indemnification from the
Escrow Fund may be initiated (the "Claims Period") shall commence at the
Effective Time and terminate at the 18-month anniversary of the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, such portion
of any Escrow Shares or other property in the Escrow Fund at the conclusion of
the Claims Period as may be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or
unsatisfied claims for Indemnifiable Damages specified in any Officers
Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to expiration of the Claims
Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to expiration of
the Claims Period shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims for
Indemnifiable Damages have been resolved or satisfied. Parent shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent a certificate specifying the Effective Time.



 

35 9.5 Claims upon Escrow Fund.

9.5.1 Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before the last day of the Claims
Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an "Officers
Certificate"):

(a) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid or
properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it may incur, pay or
properly accrue, Indemnifiable Damages;

(b) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid or properly accrued, may be the
maximum amount reasonably anticipated to be incurred, paid or properly
accrued); and

(c) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed
by Parent and any other Indemnified Party) the individual items of such
Indemnifiable Damages included in the amount so stated and the nature of the
claim to which such Indemnifiable Damages are related;

subject to the provisions of Sections 9.2, 9.3, 9.6 and 9.7, Parent (on behalf
of itself or any other Indemnified Person) shall be entitled to receive, and
the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Fund as soon
as practicable, shares or other property held in the Escrow Fund having a
value equal to such Indemnifiable Damages; provided, however, that, to the
extent that such Indemnifiable Damages have not then been incurred, paid or
properly accrued by such Indemnified Person, Parent (on behalf of itself or
any other Indemnified Person) shall not be so entitled to receive, and the
Escrow Agent shall not deliver, shares or other property held in the Escrow
Fund in respect thereof unless and until such Indemnifiable Damages are
actually incurred, paid or properly accrued by such Indemnified Person.

9.5.2 For the purpose of compensating Parent (on behalf of itself or any
other Indemnified Person) for any Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to this
Agreement, each Escrow Share in the Escrow Fund shall be valued at the Per
Share Value.

9.6 Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate
to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officers Certificate shall be
delivered to the Bridge Lender Representative by or on behalf of Parent (on
behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) and for a period of 45 days
after such delivery to the Escrow Agent of such Officers Certificate, the
Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of Escrow Shares or other property
pursuant to Section 9.5 unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written
authorization from the Bridge Lender Representative to make such delivery.
After the expiration of such 45-day period, the Escrow Agent shall make
delivery of the Escrow Shares or other property in the Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 9.5; provided that no such payment or delivery may be
made if and to the extent the Bridge Lender Representative shall object in a
written statement to any claim or claims made in the Officers Certificate,
and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent
prior to the expiration of such 45-day period.

9.7 Resolution of Objections to Claims.

9.7.1 In the event the Bridge Lender Representative shall so object in writing
to any claim or claims by any Indemnified Party made in any Officers
Certificate, Parent shall have 45 days after its receipt of such writing to
respond in a written statement to the objection of the Bridge Lender
Representative. If after such 45-day period there remains a dispute as to any
claims, the Bridge Lender Representative and Parent shall attempt in good
faith for 60 days thereafter to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Bridge Lender
Representative and Parent shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and shall distribute the shares or other property from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.



 

36 9.7.2 If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
Parent or the Bridge Lender Representative may, by written notice to the
other, demand arbitration of the dispute unless the amount of the damage or
loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within 15 days after
such written notice is sent, each of Parent and the Bridge Lender
Representative shall select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so
selected shall select a third arbitrator within ten days of their selection.
The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in
such Officers Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the Bridge
Lenders and the Incentive Plan Participants and, notwithstanding anything in
Section 9.6, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such
decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance
therewith.

9.7.3 Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa
Clara County or San Mateo County, California under the commercial rules then
in effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this
Section 9.7.3, in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount
thereof stated in the Officers Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be
deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party unless the arbitrators award Parent more
than one-half of the amount in dispute; otherwise, the Bridge Lenders and
Incentive Plan Participants shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party.
The Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the
fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association, and the expenses, including attorneys fees and costs, reasonably
incurred by the other party to the arbitration. If the Bridge Lenders and
Incentive Plan Participants are deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party, such
fees and expenses shall be paid by the Bridge Lenders and Incentive Plan
Participants solely by distributing to Parent Escrow Shares or other property
out of the Escrow Fund therefor and only to the extent there remain any such
Escrow Shares or other property in the Escrow Fund.

9.8 Bridge Lender Representative.

9.8.1 Jerry E. Keppler is hereby constituted and appointed as the Bridge
Lender Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Bridge
Lender Representative" shall mean the agent for and on behalf of the Bridge
Lenders and the Incentive Plan Participants and the Company Key Employees to:
(i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on behalf
of itself of any other Indemnified Person) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions and other
matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice
or communication shall be given or received by such stockholders
individually); (ii) authorize deliveries to Parent of shares or other property
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by Parent (on behalf
of itself or any other Indemnified Person, including by not objecting to such
claims); (iii) object to such claims pursuant to Section 9.6; (iv) consent or
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, such claims; (v) perform the functions of the Bridge Lender
Representative under Section 2.14 hereof; and (vi) take all actions necessary
or appropriate in the judgment of the Bridge Lender Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain

Bridge Lender Representative may be replaced from time to time by the holders
of a majority in interest of the Escrow Shares or other property then on

to Parent and the Escrow Agent. No bond shall be required of the Bridge Lender
Representative, and the Bridge Lender Representative shall receive no
compensation for his or her services. Notices or communications to or from
the Bridge Lender Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of
the Bridge Lenders and Incentive Plan Participants.

9.8.2 The Bridge Lender Representative shall not be liable to any Bridge
Lender or Incentive Plan Participant or Company Key Employee for any act done
or omitted hereunder as the Bridge Lender Representative while acting in good
faith, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel

Incentive Plan Participants (with respect to acts or omissions of the Bridge
Lender Representative under this Article 9) and Company Key Employees (with
respect to acts or omissions of the Bridge Lender Representative under Section
2.14) shall severally indemnify the Bridge Lender Representative and hold him
or her harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Bridge Lender Representative and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties hereunder.

nonpublic information from or about the Surviving Corporation to anyone

information confidentially).

9.8.4 Any costs or expenses actually incurred by the Bridge Lender
Representative in connection with performing his duties as such, to the
extent not otherwise recovered hereunder, shall be reimbursed to the Bridge
Lender Representative out of the Escrow Fund after the expiration of the
Claims Period, after any amounts due are paid to any Indemnified Person and
prior to releasing the remaining Escrow Fund to the Bridge Lenders and
Incentive Plan Participants, to the extent there remain at such time any
Escrow Shares or other property in the Escrow Fund.

9.9 Actions of the Bridge Lender Representative. Any notice or communication
given or received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of, the Bridge Lender Representative that is within the scope of
the Bridge Lender Representatives authority under Section 9.8.1 shall
constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure
to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of all Bridge Lenders and Incentive Plan
Participants with respect to matters under this Article 9 and, in the case of
matters under Section 2.14, all Bridge Lenders and Company Key Employees, and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such applicable Person; and
each Indemnified Person and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement,
consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such Person.
Except for their gross negligence and willful misconduct, each Indemnified
Person and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by them in accordance with any such notice,
communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent or instruction of the Bridge Lender Representative.

9.10 Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party
claim which Parent believes may result in a claim against the Escrow Fund by
or on behalf of an Indemnified Person, Parent shall promptly notify the Bridge
Lender Representative of such third-party claim, and the Bridge Lender
Representative, on behalf of the Bridge Lenders and Incentive Plan
Participants, shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any
defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
settle any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may not
effect the settlement of any such claim without the prior written consent of
the Bridge Lender Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld and shall be deemed to have been given unless the Bridge Lender
Representative shall have objected within 15 Business Days after a written
request for such consent by Parent. In the event that the Bridge Lender
Representative has consented to any such settlement, neither the Bridge Lender
Representative nor any Bridge Lender or Incentive Plan Participant shall have
any power or authority to object under Section 9.6 or any other provision of
this Article 9 to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Person against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement.

39 10.3 Interpretation; Certain Defined Terms. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and "including"
when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The headings contained in this Agreement are only for
reference purposes and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the
business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include the business
of all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to an
agreement herein is to such agreement as amended in accordance with its terms
up to the date hereof. Reference to a statute herein is to such statute, as
amended.

10.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company and delivered to Parent and the Company, it being
understood that all such Parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

10.5 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, its
Exhibits, Schedules and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the Parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including
the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule (a)
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof;
and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except as set forth in Section 2.14, Section 6.7 and
Section 9 hereof or as otherwise expressly set forth herein.

10.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

10.7 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that,
subject to the terms of Section 10.8, the Parties shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

10.8 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
of the State of California or any other jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_
, that any matters relating to the effectiveness of the Merger shall be
governed by Delaware law. The Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located in or for the State of California for any Actions arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and
the Parties agree not to commence any Action relating thereto except in such
courts). The Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any
objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement
in the state or federal courts located in the State of California, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim
in any such court that any such Action brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.



 

40 10.9 Rules of Construction. The Parties agree that they have been represented
by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

10.10 Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and, at any time after the Required
Stockholder Vote has been taken, holders of Company Capital Stock who hold
such number of shares of Company Capital Stock sufficient to take the
Required Stockholder Vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such consent shall
be required for an assignment by Parent of this Agreement and its rights and
obligations to any entity which directly or indirectly owns all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 10.10 shall be void.

10.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any Action (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the actions of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Company
Capital Stock in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
hereof.
