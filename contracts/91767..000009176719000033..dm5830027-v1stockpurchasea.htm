the parties hereto that the Closing Working Capital be calculated consistently

Working Capital to the Target Working Capital.

(d) The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies)
shall (i) permit the Seller and its agents and advisors to have reasonable
access to the books, records and other documents (including work papers,
schedules, financial statements, memoranda, etc.) pertaining to or used in
connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement and the Purchaser's
calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds and provide the Seller with copies
thereof (as reasonably requested by the Seller) and (ii) provide the Seller
and its agents and advisors reasonable access to the Purchaser's and its
Subsidiaries' (including the Acquired Companies) employees and advisors
(including making the Acquired Companies' chief financial officer(s) and
accountants available to respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of
the Seller or its representatives). If the Seller disagrees with any part of
the Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth on the
Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet, the Seller shall, within sixty
(60) days after the Seller's receipt of the Closing Statement and the Closing
Balance Sheet, notify the Purchaser in writing of such disagreement by setting
forth the Seller's calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of
the components thereof, and describing in reasonable detail the basis for 

such disagreement (an "Objection Notice"). If an Objection Notice is delivered
to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the computation of the
Closing Cash Proceeds. In the event that the Purchaser and the Seller are
unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after the
Purchaser's receipt of such Objection Notice, the Purchaser and the Seller
shall submit such remaining disagreements to a nationally‑recognized
accounting firm as is acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller (the
"Accounting Firm").

(e) The Accounting Firm shall make a final and binding determination with
respect to (i) the Purchaser's and the Seller's compliance with this Section
2.04 and (ii) the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of
the components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and
on Exhibit C. The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate with the Accounting
Firm during the term of its engagement and shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with
respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the
components thereof, as soon as practicable. The Accounting Firm shall consider
only those items and amounts in the Purchaser's and the Seller's respective
calculations of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, that are identified as being items and amounts to which the Purchaser
and the Seller have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Accounting Firm's determination of
the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be
based solely on written materials submitted by the Purchaser and the Seller
(i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions included herein. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review.

(f) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Closing
Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be borne by the
Purchaser, on one hand, the Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the
Purchaser claims the Closing Cash Proceeds are one thousand dollars ($1,000)
less than the amount determined by the Seller, and the Seller contests only
five hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the Purchaser, and if the
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Purchaser
three hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred dollars ($500) contested,
then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated sixty
percent (60%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Seller and forty percent (40%) (i.e.,
200 ÷ 500) to the Purchaser. Prior to the Accounting Firm's determination of
the Closing Cash Proceeds, (i) the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller,
on the other hand, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of any retainer paid to
the Accounting Firm and (ii) during the engagement of the Accounting Firm, the
Accounting Firm will bill fifty percent (50%) of the total charges to each of
the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand. In
connection with the Accounting Firm's determination of the Closing Cash
Proceeds, the Accounting Firm shall also determine, pursuant to the terms of
the first and second sentences of this Section 2.04(f), and taking into
account all fees and expenses already paid by each of the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, as of the date of such
determination, the allocation of its fees and expenses between the Purchaser
and the Seller, which such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties hereto.

(g) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Cash Proceeds, including
each of the components thereof, is finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.04:

(i) if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.04 are less than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, then the
Purchaser and the Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to: (A) pay to the
Purchaser from the Purchase Price 

Adjustment Escrow Funds, and to the extent the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Funds are insufficient, from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, an amount
(which in no case shall exceed the amount of the Escrow Funds) (the "Purchaser
Adjustment Amount") equal to such deficiency, and (B) pay to the Seller an
amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds is greater than the Purchaser Adjustment Amount; and

(ii) if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.04 are greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds (the total
amount of such excess, the "Seller Adjustment Amount"), then (A) the Purchaser
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an amount equal to the Seller
Adjustment Amount and (B) the Purchaser and the Seller shall cause the Escrow
Agent to pay to the Seller an amount equal to all of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds.

(h) All payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.04(g) shall (x) be treated
by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the Closing Cash Proceeds
and (y) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by the Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable. The
payments described in Section 2.04(g)(i) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Purchaser for any and all claims arising under this Agreement
with respect to this Section 2.04.

2.05 Withholding. The Purchaser (and any other Person that has any withholding
obligation with respect to any payment made pursuant to this Agreement) shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person in such amounts as the Purchaser or such other Person
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable provision of Law; provided, that the
Purchaser or such other Person shall provide the Seller with reasonable notice
prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this Section 2.05, and shall work
in good faith with the Seller to minimize any such withheld amounts. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely
paid over to the applicable Tax authority in accordance with applicable Law
and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder ("Section 280G Payments"), a
written agreement waiving such Person's right to receive some or all of such
payment or benefit (the "Waived Benefits"), to the extent necessary so that
all remaining payments and benefits applicable to such Person shall not be
deemed a parachute payment, and accepting in substitution for the Waived
Benefits the right to receive the Waived Benefits only if approved by the

thereunder.

(b) In connection with the foregoing, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller

Payments, could reasonably be considered to be "parachute payments" within the

Regulations thereunder, including Q‑7 of Section 1.280G‑1 of such Treasury
Regulations, of the right of each Person described in Section 7.04(a) to
receive or retain, as applicable, such Person's Waived Benefits, provided that
in no event shall this Section 7.04 be construed to require the Company or any
of the other Acquired Companies to compel any Person to waive any existing
rights under any contract or agreement that such Person has with the Company,
such Acquired Company or any other Person, and in no event shall the Company
or any of the other Acquired Companies be deemed in breach of this Section
7.04 if any such Person refuses to waive any such rights or if the
equityholders fail to approve any Waived Benefits. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.04 or otherwise
in this Agreement, to the extent the Purchaser has provided misinformation, or
the Purchaser's omission of information has resulted in misinformation, with
respect to any Purchaser Payments, (i) there shall be no breach of the
representation contained in Section 5.09 or the covenant contained herein and
(ii) for all purposes of this Agreement, including the calculation of any
Taxes pursuant to Article XII, no payment by, or benefit provided to, any

was provided shall be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code.

7.05 Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date hereof through the
Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01,
the Company shall not, and shall cause the other Acquired Companies not to,

transaction involving any of the Acquired Companies (other than assets sold in

Agreement, the Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions and to do or cause to be done all things necessary to

COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER

8.01 Antitrust Notification.

(a) The Seller and the Purchaser shall file with the United States Federal
Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, as promptly as

The Purchaser agrees to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every



impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Body or any
other Person so as to enable the parties hereto to expeditiously close the

avoid an in depth or second phase review by the relevant Governmental Body)
including consenting to any divestiture or other structural or conduct relief
in order to obtain clearance from any Governmental Body and, at the request of
the Company, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be obligated to contest,
administratively or in court, any ruling, order, or other action of any

redacted to (A) remove references to commercially or competitively‑sensitive
information, and (B) address reasonable attorney‑client privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 6, 2018, by and
between the Purchaser and the Seller (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and it
shall be responsible for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement by any
of the Purchaser's representatives or financing sources. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser is not authorized to and shall not
(and shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or
Affiliates to) contact any officer, director, employee (other than David

of any of the Acquired Companies or any of the Seller Entities prior to the
Closing without the prior written consent and coordination of David Walton (as
representative for the Company). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the

Company and the Seller, on the other hand;

(b) by the Purchaser or by the Seller by written notice to the other upon the

Article V shall be or have become untrue, in either case, such that any of the
conditions set forth in Section 3.01(a), Section 3.01(b) or Section 3.01(c)
would not be satisfied; provided, however, that, if such breach is curable
through the exercise of reasonable best efforts and for so long as the Seller

required pursuant to Section 2.02) is curable by the Purchaser through the

to the other surviving sections hereof), Section 13.17 and Section 13.18,
which shall survive the termination of this Agreement) without any liability
or obligation on the part of any 

party hereto, (a) other than liabilities and obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement and (b) except that no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto of any liability for damages (including expectancy
damages and loss of benefit of the bargain damages) resulting from any willful
breach by such party of this Agreement. For purposes of clarification, the
parties hereto agree that if the Purchaser does not close the transactions
contemplated hereby when required pursuant to Section 2.02, such failure or
refusal to close shall be deemed to be a willful breach of this Agreement by
the Purchaser. In no event will any party's rights to damages after
termination of this Agreement be limited, barred or prejudiced by any action,
suit, claim, investigation or proceeding for injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief as provided in Section 13.16 nor shall this Section
9.02 serve as any limitation on the rights of the Seller or the Company under
Section 13.02 or for breach of the Confidentiality Agreement.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

10.01 Acknowledgements by the Purchaser.

(a) The Purchaser and its representatives (a) have had access to and the
opportunity to review all of the documents in the Project Conan data room
maintained by Merrill Corporation behalf of the Company, and (b) has been
afforded full access to the books and records, facilities and officers,
directors, employees and other representatives of the Acquired Companies for
purposes of conducting a due diligence investigation with respect thereto. The
Purchaser and each of its Non-Recourse Persons have each conducted to its
satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of the financial
condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and
projected operations of each of the Acquired Companies and any of their
respective joint ventures and businesses, and, in making its determination to
proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Purchaser and each of its Non-Recourse Persons (i) have relied solely on the
results of such independent investigation and verification and on the
representations and warranties of the Seller expressly and specifically set
forth in Article IV and the Company expressly and specifically set forth in
Article V, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules, and (ii) have not relied
on any other representations, warranties or statements (including by omission)
of any kind or nature, whether written or oral, expressed or implied,
statutory or otherwise (including, for the avoidance of doubt, relating to
quality, quantity, condition, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose or conformity to samples) of the Company or the Seller or any of their
respective Non-Recourse Persons as to any matter concerning any of the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective joint ventures or businesses or
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any information
provided to (or otherwise acquired by) the Purchaser or any of its Non-
Recourse Persons in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
statements, information, documents, projections, forecasts or other materials
made available to the Purchaser or any of its Non-Recourse Persons in any
"data rooms" or presentations, including "management presentations"). In
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Purchaser has been
represented by, and adequately consulted with, legal counsel of its choice and
the Purchaser and such counsel has carefully read this Agreement and has been
given time to consider this Agreement, understands this Agreement and, after
such consideration, and with such understanding, the Purchaser has knowingly,
freely and without coercion entered into this Agreement and, in particular,
this Section 10.01.

(b) The representations and warranties of the Seller and the Company expressly
and specifically set forth in Article IV and Article V, as qualified by the
Disclosure Schedules, constitute the sole and exclusive representations,
warranties, and statements (including by omission) of any kind or nature,
whether written or oral, expressed or implied, statutory or otherwise
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, relating to quality, quantity,
condition, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or conformity to 

samples) of any of the Company, the Seller or any of their respective Non-
Recourse Persons as to any matter concerning the Acquired Companies or any of
their respective joint ventures or businesses or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or with respect
to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided to (or otherwise
acquired by) the Purchaser or any of its Non-Recourse Persons in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any statements, information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to the
Purchaser or any of its Non-Recourse Persons in any "data rooms" or
presentations including "management presentations") and all other purported
representations and warranties or statements (including by omission) are
hereby disclaimed by the Company, the Seller, the Seller and each of their
respective Non-Recourse Persons and (i) each of the Purchaser and its Non-
Recourse Persons has relied and will only rely on the representations and
warranties of the Seller and the Company expressly and specifically set forth
in Article IV and Article V, respectively, (ii) each of the Purchaser and its
Non-Recourse Persons hereby expressly and irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that he, she or it has not relied on any other representations, warranties or
statements (including by omission on any basis or theory whatsoever (including
in contract, tort or equity, on public policy grounds, under securities laws
or otherwise)), and (iii) none of the Purchaser or any of its Non-Recourse
Persons shall have any claim with respect to their purported use of, or
reliance on, any such representations, warranties or statements (including by
omission). The Purchaser is otherwise acquiring the Acquired Companies, their
joint ventures and their respective businesses on an "AS IS, WHERE IS" basis.
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
projections, forward looking statements and other forecasts and estimates, and
certain business plan information, that the Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties, that the Purchaser and its Non-Recourse Persons are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
any such projections, forward looking statements, forecasts, estimates and
business plan information provided to (or otherwise acquired by) the Purchaser
and its Non-Recourse Persons in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such projections, forward looking statements, forecasts, estimates and
business plan information). Under no circumstances shall any of the
representations and warranties of the Company or the Seller made herein be
imputed to, or deemed to have been made by or conspired to be made by, any
other Person.

10.02 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing, as and when requested in
writing by any party hereto and at such requesting party's expense, any other
party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all
such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem
necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

10.03 Employees and Employee Benefits.

(a) Salary and Wages. The Purchaser will cause the Acquired Companies to
continue the employment effective immediately after the Closing of all
Business Employees, including each such employee on medical, disability,
family or other leave of absence as of the Closing. The Purchaser will cause
the Acquired Companies to continue to provide each such Business Employee with
at least the same base wages, annual base salary and annual rate of cash bonus
potential (determined as a percentage of annual base salary) (but excluding
any equity plan program or arrangement) provided to each such employee on the
Closing Date for a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10.03(a) shall obligate the
Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue
the employment of any such Business Employee for any specific period.

(b) Employee Benefits. Each Plan sponsored and maintained by an Acquired
Company prior to the Closing shall continue to be sponsored and maintained by
such Acquired Company 

immediately following the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, on and following the Closing Date,
the Acquired Companies shall retain all assets, interests, obligations and
liabilities under each of the Plans. As of the Closing Date and for a period
of at least one (1) year thereafter, the Purchaser shall provide, or shall
cause the applicable Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries to provide, each
Business Employee with benefits and other forms of compensation (other than
any equity‑based compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate
to the benefits and other forms of compensation provided to such Business
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
Purchaser agrees to provide or cause the Acquired Companies to provide each
such Business Employee (i) who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement
with terms of employment (including compensation and benefits) as set forth in
such agreement and (ii) who is employed in a jurisdiction outside of the
United States with terms and conditions of employment (including compensation
and benefits) sufficient to meet any statutory or legal requirements in such
jurisdictions, including any such statute that would subject the Seller or its
Affiliates to incur any severance, termination or similar liability.

(c) Employee Service Credit. To the extent the Purchaser establishes any new
benefit or compensation plans for Business Employees after the Closing, the
Purchaser (i) shall give, or cause the Acquired Companies to give, each
Business Employee credit under any benefit plan or personnel policies that
cover the Business Employee after the Closing Date, including any vacation,
sick leave and severance policies, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance benefits for the Business
Employee's service with any of the Acquired Companies and its Affiliates prior
to the Closing Date, to the same extent recognized by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof as of the Closing Date, (ii) shall
allow such Business Employees to participate in each plan providing welfare
benefits without regard to preexisting condition limitations, waiting periods,
evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the
Business Employee by the corresponding Plans immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and (iii) if any Welfare Plan is terminated prior to the end of the plan
year that includes the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall credit the Business
Employee with any expenses that were covered by such Welfare Plan(s) for
purposes of determining deductibles, co‑pays and other applicable limits under
any similar replacement plans.

(d) Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays. The Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Companies to continue to credit to each Business Employee all vacation and
personal holiday pay that the Business Employee is entitled to use but has not
used as of the Closing Date (including any earned vacation or personal holiday
pay to be used in future years), and shall assume all liability for the
payment of such amounts.

(e) No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 10.03 are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or
former employee, officer, director, manager or consultant, or any other
individual associated therewith, shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Section 10.03. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Plan or any other
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the
Purchaser, any Acquired Company, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates;
(ii) alter or limit the ability of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies,
Seller or any other Seller Entity to amend, modify or terminate any Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant, any right to employment or continued
employment or continued service with the Purchaser, any of the Acquired
Companies, Seller or any other Seller Entity, or constitute or create an
employment agreement with any employee.

10.04 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing Date, (i) the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Acquired Companies), Affiliates and its and their 

respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives to, keep
confidential and not to disclose any information, whether written or oral,
relating to the Seller, the Seller Entities, their respective Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies) (the "Seller Restricted Information"), and
(ii) the Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives to, keep
confidential and not disclose any information, whether written or oral,
relating to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (whether in the possession
of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, or their respective Subsidiaries at
the time of the Closing or subsequently obtained by the Purchaser, the
Acquired Companies or their respective Subsidiaries) (the "Purchaser
Restricted Information" and, together with the Seller Restricted Information,
the "Restricted Information"); provided that in no event shall this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement (subject the any confidentiality and non-disclosure
obligations expressly set forth therein) be deemed to be Restricted
Information. The obligation to keep the Restricted Information confidential
shall continue indefinitely from the Closing Date but shall not apply to any
information (i) that is in the public domain, (ii) that is published or
otherwise becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the disclosing
party, (iii) that becomes available to the disclosing party from sources which
are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation known to the disclosing party or (iv) independently
developed without use or referring to any Restricted Information. The
foregoing shall not, however, restrict disclosures in connection with any
dispute between the parties or required by Law, order or the rules of any
officially recognized securities exchange or another Governmental Body,
including in response to any request for information or documents by a
Governmental Body in connection with an investigation of the transactions
described herein, in which case, to the extent legally permissible and
practical under the circumstances, before making such disclosure the
disclosing party shall first provide the Purchaser or the Seller, as
applicable, with prompt notice thereof so that the Purchaser or the Seller, as
applicable, may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy (in either
case, at such party's sole cost and expense) or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Section 10.04. In the event that such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained or the applicable party waives compliance with
the provisions of this Section 10.04, the disclosing party, shall or shall
cause the Person required to disclose such Restricted Information to, furnish
only that portion of the Restricted Information that such Person is advised by
the Seller's or the Purchaser's outside counsel, as applicable, is legally
required and shall exercise reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance
that confidential treatment is accorded to the Restricted Information so
furnished. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.04 to the contrary, the
Seller and its representatives shall be entitled to communicate with and may
disclose the terms and the existence of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein and the Acquired Companies' historical financial
information (but not any proprietary or commercially sensitive information)
for the period during which the Acquired Companies were owned by the Seller,
to their Affiliates in order that such Persons may provide information about
the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein
to their respective current and prospective equity owners, investors and
limited partners in connection with their fundraising and reporting activities
to the extent such Persons are bound by a reasonable obligation of
confidentiality to the Seller or one of its Affiliates.

10.05 Director, Manager and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit the Acquired Companies to, amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any provision in any of such Acquired Companies' certificate or
articles of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent governing documents)
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers, directors or
similar functionaries (each, a "DandO Indemnified Party") (unless to provide for
greater exculpation or indemnification or unless required by Law), it being
agreed by the parties hereto that the current and former officers, directors,
managers and similar functionaries of the Acquired Companies shall continue to
be entitled to and the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide
such exculpation and indemnification (including with respect to advancement of
expenses) to the full extent of the Law. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges
that this Section 10.05 shall be binding on the Purchaser's successors and
assigns. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Closing Date) is made against any individual who was an officer, director
or similar functionary of any of the Acquired Companies at or prior to the
Closing or any other party covered by directors' and officers' liability
insurance, on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, the
provisions of this Section 10.05 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(c) The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses
conferred in this Section 10.05 shall not be exclusive of any other right that
a DandO Indemnified Party is indemnified pursuant to this Section 10.05 may have
or hereafter acquire under any applicable Law, provision of this Agreement,
any agreement or vote of members or disinterested directors or otherwise. The
Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the DandO Indemnified Parties have or may, in
the future, have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or
insurance provided by other entities or organizations (collectively, the
"Other Indemnitors" and, individually, an "Other Indemnitor"). The Purchaser
hereby agrees that, with respect to any advancement or indemnification
obligation owed, at any time, to a DandO Indemnified Party by any Acquired
Company or any Other Indemnitor, whether pursuant to any certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement,
indemnification agreement or other document or agreement or pursuant to this
Section 10.05 (any of the foregoing is herein an "Indemnification Agreement"),
the Acquired Company (a) shall at all times, be the indemnitor of first resort
(i.e., its obligations to a DandO Indemnified Party shall be primary and any
obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by a DandO
Indemnified Party shall be secondary), (b) shall at all times be required to
advance the full amount of expenses incurred by a DandO Indemnified Party and
shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties,
fines and amounts paid in settlement (to the extent legally permitted and as
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Indemnification Agreement),
without regard to any rights that a DandO Indemnified Party may have against the
Other Indemnitors and (c) irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the
Other Indemnitors from any and all claims (i) against the Other Indemnitors
for contribution, subrogation, indemnification or any other recovery of any
kind in respect thereof and (ii) that the DandO Indemnified Party must seek
expense advancement or reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Other
Indemnitor before the Acquired Company must perform their expense advancement
and reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this Agreement. The
Purchaser hereby further agrees that no advancement, indemnification or other
payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of a DandO Indemnified Party with
respect to any claim for which a DandO Indemnified Party has sought
indemnification from the Acquired Company shall affect the foregoing, and the
Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution or be subrogated to the
extent of such advancement, indemnification or other payment to all of the
rights of recovery of such DandO Indemnified Party against the Acquired Company,
and the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless against such amounts
actually paid by the Other Indemnitors to or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified
Party to the extent such amounts would have otherwise been payable by the
Acquired Company to a DandO Indemnified Party. Each Other Indemnitor is an
express third-party beneficiary of the Purchaser's covenants and agreements in
this Section 10.05.

(d) The obligations under this Section 10.05 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee or exculpee to
whom this Section 10.05 applies without the consent of such affected
indemnitee or exculpee. The provisions of this Section 10.05 are intended for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by (as express third party
beneficiaries), each current and former officer, director or similar
functionary of each of the Acquired Companies and his or her heirs and
representatives, successors and assigns and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have had by contract or otherwise.

10.06 RandW Insurance Policy. The Purchaser shall cause the RandW Insurance Policy
to be fully-bound and issued as of the Closing Date (in accordance with the
terms of the conditional binder thereof) 

and remain in full force and effect thereafter, including paying when due all
premiums, fees, costs and taxes payable thereunder and satisfying on a timely
basis all conditions necessary for the issuance, continuance or application of
coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy. The Purchaser shall not, and shall
not permit its Affiliates to, amend, waive coverage under, terminate, commute
or otherwise modify the RandW Insurance Policy or any of the coverage thereunder
in any manner that adversely affects the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

ARTICLE XI 

INDEMNIFICATION

11.01 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each
representation warranty, covenant and obligation contained herein and any
certificate related to any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation will survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for
fifteen (15) months from the Closing Date (such date, the "Survival Expiration
Date"); provided, however, that any covenant contained in this Agreement that,
by its terms, provides for performance following the Closing Date shall
survive until such covenant is performed. No Indemnification Claim may be
asserted pursuant to this Agreement unless (i) on or before the Survival
Expiration Date, such claim is asserted by proper written notice in accordance
with this Article XI, specifying, in reasonable detail, the basis of the claim
and (ii) such claim is made in respect of Damages specified, in reasonable
detail, and incurred prior to the Survival Expiration Date or, to the extent
arising out of an Indemnification Claim asserted in writing prior to the
Survival Expiration Date, such Indemnification Claim is made in respect of a
reasonably estimated amount of Damages reasonably expected to arise in
connection with such claim. No Indemnification Claim arising from a claim (or
an expected claim) by a third-party may be asserted pursuant to this Agreement
unless such third-party has actually commenced an action and, if the third-
party claim is with respect to Taxes, the Indemnified Party has received a
written notice of assessment or written notice of deficiency, in each case,
with respect to the specific matters of such Indemnification Claim.

11.02 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to Section 11.04, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") shall be
entitled to indemnification solely from the Indemnification Escrow Funds for
any and all Damages to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty by the Seller or the Company has made in Article IV
or Article V, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement requiring performance by any Acquired Company or the Seller prior to
or at the Closing or by the Seller after the Closing, or (iii) any Pre-Closing
Taxes (except to the extent amounts with respect to such Taxes were taken into
account in the calculation of the Working Capital or Indebtedness).

(b) Subject to Section 11.04, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller harmless for any and all Damages to the
extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty Purchaser
has made in Article VI, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement requiring performance by Purchaser prior to or at the
Closing or by Purchaser or any Acquired Company after the Closing or (iii) any
Transfer Taxes.

(c) The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this Article XI shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have 

been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The
Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of
Damages suffered by it.

11.03 Indemnification Claim Procedures.

(a) Upon receipt of any notice of an Action that may give rise to an
Indemnification Claim by a Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (each, an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly (i) notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Action, (C) including the Indemnified Party's best
estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from such Action and (D)
describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's request
for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in
accordance with this Section 11.03(a) will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1)
the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
give or cause to be given such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to
notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in
accordance with this Section 11.03(a) prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

(b) An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel
of the Indemnitor's choice and to settle or compromise any such Action, and
each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of
such defense by the Indemnitor (including the making of any related claims,
counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person in connection with the
Action) and/or the settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall not agree to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without
the Indemnified Party's prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement provide for a
complete release of the claims that are the subject of such Action in favor of
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of
an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not thereafter promptly
assume such defense, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of
such Action; provided, however, that (A) the Indemnified Party will not agree
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to such Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (B) the
Indemnitor may thereafter assume at any time the defense of such Action. To
the extent the defense of any Action subject to any Indemnification Claim is
assumed by the Seller as the Indemnitor, at the election of the Indemnitor,
the costs and expenses of such defense of, and any payment in respect of, any
Action, including any settlement thereof, shall be paid from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds and Purchaser and the Seller shall promptly
submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse such portion of the Indemnification Escrow Funds as is
reasonably requested in writing by the Seller to pay such costs and expenses
or other amounts; provided, however, that no amounts will be payable from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds, unless the Indemnified Party is actually
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(c) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable
Indemnification Claim relates. All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified
Party.

11.04 Limitations on Indemnification Liability. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party makes under
this Article XI will be limited as follows: 

(a) Indemnification Cap. The aggregate amount of Damages for which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article XI will, subject to the immediately following sentence, not
exceed $1,100,000. The Indemnification Escrow Amount then remaining in escrow
shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment of any Indemnification
Claim pursuant to Section 11.02(a).

(b) Claims Basket. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i) (other than for claims for
breaches of Fundamental Representations) to the extent the aggregate amount of
all Damages incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.02(a)(i) (other than for claims for breaches of Fundamental
Representations) exceeds $1,100,000 (the "Basket Amount"), and once the
aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds the Basket Amount, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages
to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount. The Basket Amount shall
not apply to any indemnification claims under Section 11.02(a)(ii) or Section
11.02(a)(iii), or for claims for breaches of Fundamental Representations under
Section 11.02(a)(i).

(c) Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Third-Party Recoveries. All
Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Article XI shall be reduced by the amount of any
insurance proceeds (but not including any possible recovery under the RandW
Insurance Policy), indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries
to which any Indemnified Party is entitled in respect of any Damages incurred
by such Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates may be entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or
any third-party recoveries in respect of any Damages (or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI, such Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize
such proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries. In the event that any such
insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are
obtained, received or realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt
by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect
of the claims to which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other
third-party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by
the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such
indemnification payment.

(d) Assignment of Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this Article XI, at the election of the
Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its
claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Damages, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

(e) Calculation of Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or an
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining
the amount of Damages resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in
any representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms
"material", "materiality", or "in all material respects" or any similar term
or phrase will be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that
for the purposes of determining liability under this Article XI, the
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement will
be read as if such terms and phrases were not included in them; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) such terms and phrases when
used as an adjective in any definition set forth in Section 1.01 and (ii) any
representation and warranty set forth in (A) the last sentence of Section
5.05(a), (B) Section 5.06(a), and (C) Section 5.10(a)(xi). 

(f) Damages Reserved for on the Post-Closing Statement or Included in Purchase

any Damages (i) in respect of any liability or obligation accrued or reserved
for in determining Closing Cash Proceeds or (ii) in respect of any liability
included in the calculation of the Purchase Price.

(g) No Duplicate Claims. In the event a Purchaser Indemnified Party or the
Seller, as the case may be, recovers Damages in respect of an Indemnification
Claim, no other Purchaser Indemnified Party or the Seller, as applicable, may
recover the same Damages in respect of a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement.

(h) Limitations on Tax Indemnification. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
be indemnified for the following Taxes (or related Damages): (i) any Tax with
respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period (including as a result of the
unavailability in any Post-Closing Tax Period of any net operating loss
carryforward, capital loss carryforward, Tax credit carryforward or other Tax
attribute from a Pre-Closing Tax Period); (ii) any Tax attributable to a
breach of the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) of any provision of this Agreement; (iii) any Transfer Tax; (iv)
any Tax to the extent included in the computation of the Purchase Price; (v)
resulting from any transaction or event taken by or at the direction of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on the Closing Date after the Closing
outside the ordinary course of business and not specifically contemplated by
this Agreement; or (vi) resulting from any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into at any time by or at the direction of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates.

11.05 Mitigation of Damages. An Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article XI.

11.06 Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, except for
intentional fraud, claims under this Article XI shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow
Funds shall be the sole source of recovery of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties. The parties recognize that any further recovery for breaches of
representations and warranties under this Agreement by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be under the RandW Insurance Policy (subject to the
terms and conditions thereof). In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser and
each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against any indemnifying party
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement based upon predecessor or
successor liability, contribution, tort, strict liability or any Law or
otherwise. All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are
contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set
forth in this Article XI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(a) each of Purchaser hereby waives any statutory and common law remedies,
including remedies that may be available under Environmental Laws, with
respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters);

(b) after the Closing Date, none of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this Article XI
were specifically bargained for between the parties hereto and were taken into
account by the parties hereto in arriving at the Purchase Price; 

(d) the parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement;

(e) the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related
to the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded
pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement); and the parties hereto
hereby agree that no party hereto shall have any remedies or cause of action
(whether in contract or in tort) for any statements, communications,
disclosures, failures to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth
in this Agreement;

(f) the parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arm's-length negotiations and the parties hereto specifically acknowledge that
no party hereto has any special relationship with another party hereto that
would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary
seller in an arm's-length transaction; and

(g) for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.04 shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of
this Section 11.06 and shall not be limited by the terms of this Section
11.06.

11.07 Release of Escrow. The Escrow Agreement shall specify that the
Indemnification Escrow Funds (if any) shall be released to the Seller on the
first Business Day following the Survival Expiration Date; provided, however,
that, if any Indemnification Claim shall have been properly asserted by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to
the Survival Expiration Date and remains pending on the Survival Expiration
Date (any such claim, a "Pending Claim"), (i) the Indemnification Escrow Funds
released to the Seller shall be the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds
then held by the Escrow Agent, minus the aggregate amount of such Pending
Claim and (ii) any funds that remain in escrow following the Survival
Expiration Date in respect of any such Pending Claim shall be released to the
Seller promptly upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of such
Pending Claim. In each case in which this Section 11.07 provides for the
release of Indemnification Escrow Funds, each of Purchaser and the Seller
shall promptly submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute the Indemnification Escrow Funds in
accordance with this Section 11.07 and the Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE XII 

TAX MATTERS

12.01 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

(a) The Company, using its historic Tax Return preparers, shall prepare or
cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, the due date of which (taking into account extensions of the time
to file) is after the Closing Date to the extent not filed prior to the
Closing (the "Company Returns"). All such Company Returns shall be prepared
and filed in a manner consistent with the past procedures and practices of the
Acquired Companies except as required by applicable Law. The Company shall
submit each such Company Return to the Seller at least thirty (20) days prior
to the due date (taking into account any extensions of the time to file) for
the Seller's approval. Seller 

shall respond with any comments within ten (10) days of receipt of such Tax
Returns and any dispute with respect to any Company Return shall be promptly
resolved by a mutually agreeable accounting firm in accordance with the
principles set forth in Section 2.4 mutatis mutandis. Purchaser shall cause
the Acquired Companies to timely file each such Company Return. The Purchaser
shall or shall cause the Acquired Companies to pay, when due or as promptly as
possible thereafter, all Taxes due and payable with respect to any Company
Returns.

(b) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns with
respect to Taxes of the Acquired Companies Straddle Periods, the due date of
which (taking into account extensions of the time to file) is after the
Closing Date to the extent not filed prior to the Closing (the "Purchaser
Returns"). All such Purchaser Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner
consistent with the past procedures and practices of the Acquired Companies
except as required by applicable Law. The Purchaser shall submit each such
Purchaser Return to the Seller at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date
(taking into account any extensions of the time to file) for the Seller's
approval. Seller shall respond with any comments within ten (10) days of
receipt of such Tax Returns and any dispute with respect to any Purchaser
Return shall be promptly resolved by a mutually agreeable accounting firm in
accordance with the principles set forth in Section 2.4 mutatis mutandis.
Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to timely file each such
Purchaser Return. The Purchaser shall or shall cause the Acquired Companies to
pay, when due or as promptly as possible thereafter, all Taxes due and payable
with respect to any Purchaser Returns.

(c) The Purchaser shall cause the Company to join in the Purchaser's
"consolidated group" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-1(h)
beginning of the day following the Closing Date). The tax year of the Company
shall close as of the end of the Closing Date for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, for state, local or
non-U.S. income tax purposes. The Purchaser and the Seller agree that the
Acquired Companies shall (i) allocate all Transaction Deductions accruing on
the Closing Date to the Company's taxable period ending on the Closing Date
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and not
pursuant to the "next day" rule under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or pursuant to the ratable allocation method under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii)) to
the extent "more likely than not" allocable to such taxable period; and (ii)
deduct the Transaction Deductions on the Tax Returns of the Company for the
taxable period that ends on the Closing Date to the maximum extent permitted
under applicable Law.

12.02 Transfer Taxes. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due,
all Transfer Taxes shall be borne by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall or
shall cause the Acquired Companies to pay, when due or as promptly as possible
thereafter, all Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser shall prepare any Tax Returns
with respect to such Taxes, and the Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser
in the preparation of such Tax Returns.

12.03 Certain Tax Covenants. The Purchaser covenants that, on or after the
Closing Date, except as required by Law, it shall not and shall not cause or
permit the Acquired Companies or any of its Affiliates to (i) take any action
or omit to take any action on or after the Closing Date, including the
distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption that the
Purchaser or any applicable Affiliate of the Purchaser is aware, or ought
reasonably to be aware, could give rise to any Tax liability, or reduce any
Tax asset, of the Seller, (ii) without the prior written consent of Seller,
make any claim, surrender, disclaimer, notice, consent election or deemed
election under applicable Law with respect to any of the Acquired Companies in
respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period; (iii) file any Tax Return of the Acquired
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (except as provided in Section
12.01); (iv) make or change any Tax election or amend, re-file or otherwise
modify any Tax Return of the Acquired Companies or take any Tax position on
any Tax Return of the Acquired Companies that the Purchaser is aware, or ought
reasonably to be aware, results in any increased Tax liability or reduction in
any Tax asset of the Seller or the Acquired Companies 

with respect to or that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(v) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any statute of
limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency
related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (vi) make or initiate any voluntary
contact with a Taxing Authority (including any voluntary disclosure agreement
or similar process) regarding any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

12.04 Cooperation. Each party hereto agrees to, and agrees to cause their
Affiliates to, cooperate fully, as reasonably requested by the other parties,
in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return of the Seller, Company or
any Company Subsidiary for a period ending on or before the Closing Date or
any Straddle Tax Period and the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim. Such
cooperation shall include the retention of and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to the
Tax matters and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide the additional information.

12.05 Tax Audits and Claims. Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in
writing upon receipt by any Acquired Company, Purchaser Indemnified Party or
any of their Affiliates of any written notice from any Governmental Authority
of an Action with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired Company that
could give rise to a claim for indemnification under Section 11.02(a) or that
relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (collectively, a "Tax
Contest Claim"). Such notice shall include a copy of any correspondence and
any other written material receiving from the applicable Governmental Body.
Purchaser and the Seller shall in accordance with Section 12.04 cooperate with
each other in the conduct of a Tax Contest Claim and, as necessary or
requested, provide (or cause the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party to
provide) any power of attorneys with respect to such Tax Contest Claim.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Seller shall have
the right to control any Tax Contest Claim with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period of any Acquired Company which could result in a Tax that is subject to
indemnification under Section 11.02(a) or that relates to any Seller Return
(any such claim, a "Seller's Tax Contest Claim"); provided that if the
resolution or settlement of any portion of a Seller's Tax Contest Claim would
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any Purchaser Indemnified
Party in a Post-Closing Tax Period, (i) the Seller shall keep the Purchaser
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Seller's Tax
Contest Claim; (ii) Purchaser shall be entitled at its expense to participate
in such Seller's Tax Contest Claim; and (iii) the Seller shall not compromise
or settle any such portion of a Seller's Tax Contest Claim without obtaining
the Purchaser's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned). Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Purchaser shall control the conduct of any Tax Contest
Claim that the Seller does not have the right to control, or has not yet
elected to control; provided that (x) Purchaser shall keep the Seller informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest Claim; (y)
the Seller shall be entitled at its expense to fully participate in such Tax
Contest Claim; and (z) the Purchaser shall not, and shall not allow any of its
Affiliates, to settle any such Tax Contest Claim without obtaining the
Seller's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Seller shall be solely responsible for
contesting an Action with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Seller,
including those that relate to operations of the Company.

12.06 Sections 336 and 338 of the Code. No party to this Agreement shall make
an election under Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.07 No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. The Purchaser shall not take
any action or cause any action to be taken with respect to the Company
subsequent to the Closing that would cause the transactions contemplated
hereby to constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or
substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described
in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2001‑16, 2001 1 C.B. 730, and Internal
Revenue Service Notice 2008‑20 I.R.B. 2008 6 (January 17, 2008), and Internal
Revenue Service Notice 2008‑111 I.R.B. 1299 (December 1, 2008). 

12.08 Tax Refunds. Except to the extent included as an asset in Working
Capital (as finally determined hereunder), the Seller shall be entitled to all
Tax refunds and credits received by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, or the
Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser will pay over to
the Seller any such Tax refunds or credits promptly (but in all cases within
five (5) Business Days) after receipt of such Tax refunds or credits. If the
Acquired Companies are entitled to any refund of estimated Taxes for the
taxable year ending on the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall cause the
Acquired Companies to file IRS Form 4466 (and any comparable state or local
form) following the Closing Date to obtain any material refund. Purchaser
agrees that the Acquired Companies shall elect to carry back any item of loss,
deduction or credit of the Acquired Companies from the tax period ending on
the Closing Date, to prior taxable years to the fullest extent permitted by
law (using any available short-form or accelerated procedures and filing
amended Tax Returns to the extent necessary) and obtain any potential Tax
refunds or credits related thereto. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Purchaser shall request a refund (rather than a credit in lieu of a refund)
with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

ARTICLE XIII

customers, suppliers or other business relations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, shall be issued or made without the joint approval of the
Purchaser and the Seller, unless required by Law (in the reasonable opinion of

13.04 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by either the Purchaser or the Company without the prior
written consent of the other party; provided, that (i) this Agreement, and all
rights, interests and obligations hereunder, may be assigned, in whole or in
part, without consent, upon written notice to the Purchaser, by the Seller to
any of its Affiliates and (ii) after the Closing each of the Purchaser, the
Seller and the Company may assign their respective rights under this Agreement
to their lenders as collateral security for their obligations under any of
their secured debt financing arrangements.

13.05 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

13.06 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or otherwise
modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. In the event a subject matter is
addressed in more than one (1) representation and warranty in Article V, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to rely only on the most specific representation
and warranty addressing such matter. The specification of any dollar amount
(or dollar equivalent amount) or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedules or exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the
ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of
the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the
parties hereto as to whether any obligation, item or matter not set forth or
included in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits is or is not
required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. In addition,
matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure
Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. The
information contained in this Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules, and
exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any
violation of Law or breach of contract).

13.07 Amendment and Waiver. Except as provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be amended or
waived only in a writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller;
provided, that this proviso, the proviso in Section 13.09, Section 13.11 and
Section 13.13 may not be amended in a manner that is materially adverse to the
Debt Financing Sources without the consent of the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter that have consent rights over amendments to this Agreement.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall
extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent
breach or default. 

13.08 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement
between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or between the parties hereto, written or oral, which
may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

13.09 Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person any legal or equitable right,
remedy, liability or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement, other than (a) the parties to this Agreement or
their respective successors and permitted assigns, (b) for purposes of Section
10.05, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties and his or her heirs and
representatives and the Other Indemnitors, (c) for purposes of Section 10.01,
Section 11.06, Section 13.02, Section 13.12 and Section 13.13, each of the
Purchaser's and the Seller's respective Non-Recourse Persons, as applicable.

13.10 Counterparts. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery") shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto, each other party hereto or thereto shall re
execute the original form of this Agreement and deliver such form to all other
parties hereto. No party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

13.11 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto, and all claims and disputes arising
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, whether
purporting to sound in contract or tort, or at law or in equity, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules
or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby agree and consent to be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, to the extent such court declines jurisdiction, first to any
federal court, or second, to any state court, each located in Wilmington,
Delaware, to the exclusion of other courts, and hereby waive the right to
assert the lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue
in connection with any such suit, action or other proceeding. In furtherance
of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto (a) waives the defense of
inconvenient forum, (b) agrees not to commence any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transactions contemplated
hereby other than in any such court, and (c) agrees that a final judgment in
any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION, PROCEEDING, CROSS‑CLAIM, OR
COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY COURT (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH (i) THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR
(ii) THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION,
DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no party hereto, nor any of its Affiliates, will bring, or
support the bringing of, any claim, whether at law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source in any 

way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter (including the Fee Letters) or the performance thereof,
anywhere other than in (i) a New York State Court sitting in the County of New
York or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (Borough of Manhattan), and the parties hereto further hereby irrevocably
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which they may
now have or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such claim in any such court.

13.12 Legal Representation. Following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of the Acquired Companies' current and former legal
counsel (including KandE LLP) (collectively, "Company Counsel") may serve as
counsel to each and any of the Seller Entities and their respective Non-
Recourse Persons, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement notwithstanding such representation or any continued
representation of any other Person (including Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC
and its Affiliates), and each of the parties (on behalf of itself and each of
its Non-Recourse Persons) hereto consents thereto and waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom. The decision to represent any of the Seller and
its Non-Recourse Persons shall be solely that of Company Counsel. The Company
further agrees that, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries,
Company Counsel's retention by the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries shall be deemed completed and terminated without any further
action by any Person effective as of the Closing.

13.13 Sources of Recovery. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that (i) no Non-
Recourse Persons of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein
except to the extent agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse Persons and
(ii) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability to the Company or the
Seller relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
herein pursuant to this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that
for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser and its Affiliates (if applicable)
shall have recourse against, and nothing in this Agreement shall in any way
limit or modify the rights of the Purchaser and its Affiliates (if applicable)
against (or the obligations of), the Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive documentation with
respect to the Financing).

13.14 Deliveries to the Purchaser. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that
all documents or other items delivered in writing (including by electronic
mail) to the Purchaser or its representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or uploaded and made available in
the online "data room" established by Merrill Corporation for Project Conan on
or before the date that is one (1) Business Day prior to the date hereof shall
be deemed to have been delivered, provided or made available to the Purchaser
or its representatives for all purposes hereunder.

13.15 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement shall govern and control.

13.16 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary relief (including any damages payable pursuant to Section
9.02), even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto
fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the Closing.
It is accordingly agreed that (a) the parties hereto will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts 

described in Section 13.11 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in Section 9.02 are not intended to
and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach
of this Agreement and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any party's right to specific performance or other equitable
relief and (c) the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is
an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and without that
right, neither the Company nor the Purchaser would have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages (including any damages payable pursuant to Section 9.02) would provide
an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at
law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party pursuing an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 13.16 will not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such order. The remedies available to the Company and
the Seller pursuant to this Section 13.16 will be in addition to any other
remedy to which they were entitled at law or in equity, and the election to
pursue an injunction or specific performance will not restrict, impair or
otherwise limit a party from seeking to collect or collecting damages pursuant
to Section 9.02. If, prior to the Outside Date (as it may be extended pursuant
to Section 9.01(c)), any party hereto brings any action, in each case in
accordance with Section 13.11, to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside Date will
automatically be extended (y) for the period during which such action is
pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (z) by such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may be and
this Agreement shall not be terminable pursuant to Section 9.01 during the
pendency of such action.

13.17 Relationship of the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute the parties hereto as joint venturers, alter egos, partners or
participants in an unincorporated business or other separate entity, nor,
except as expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement in any manner
create any principal‑agent, fiduciary or other special relationship between
the parties hereto. No party shall have any duties (including fiduciary
duties) towards any other party hereto except as specifically set forth
herein.

13.18 Prevailing Party. Other than with respect to disputes arising pursuant
to Section 2.04, in any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement,
any of the exhibits or schedules hereto, or any agreement, document,
instrument or certificate contemplated hereby, or any transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, the applicable adjudicating body shall award
to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably
incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the dispute and the
enforcement of its rights under this Agreement, any of the exhibits or
schedules hereto, or any agreement, document, instrument or certificate
contemplated hereby and, if the adjudicating body determines a party to be the
prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party won on some
but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the adjudicating body may award
the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys'
fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the
adjudication and the enforcement of its rights under this Agreement, any of
the exhibits or schedules hereto, or any agreement, document, instrument or
certificate contemplated hereby or thereby.

Exhibit C

Rules of Engagement for Accounting Firm

If an Accounting Firm is engaged pursuant to Section 2.04(c), the Purchaser
and the Seller will instruct the Accounting Firm to analyze and resolve the
parties' dispute in accordance with the following guidelines (which guidelines
and relevant portions of this Agreement the Accounting Firm will be required
to review and commit to acting in accordance with):

Timetable

The timetable for these proceedings will be governed by the following
procedures:

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Within thirty (30) calendar days of retaining the Accounting Firm, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall submit to the Accounting Firm five (5) copies
of a memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth their
respective positions of all unresolved disputed items in accordance with
Section 2.04(c) of this Agreement (the "Initial Report"). 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Within one (1) Business Day upon receipt of both the Purchaser's and the
Seller's Initial Reports, the Accounting Firm will distribute a copy of each
Initial Report to the other party. 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receiving the other party's Initial
Report from the Accounting Firm, each of the Purchaser and the Seller may (but
shall not be required to) submit to the Accounting Firm five (5) copies of a
memorandum responding to the Initial Report submitted to the Accounting Firm
by the other party (the "Rebuttal Report"). The Rebuttal Report is to be
responsive solely to the arguments raised, and information submitted, by the
other party in its Initial Report and no party may introduce new arguments or
rely on new information in the Rebuttal Report that was not part of such
party's Initial Report or which are not directly responsive to an argument
raised by the other party's Initial Report, except to the extent such new
arguments or new information are used in direct response to arguments raised
and information submitted by the other party in its Initial Report. 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Within one (1) Business Day upon receipt of both the Purchaser's and the
Seller's Rebuttal Reports, the Accounting Firm will distribute a copy of each
Rebuttal Report to the other party. 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

At any time before or within fifteen (15) calendar days after the submission
of the Initial Reports or any Rebuttal Reports by the Purchaser and the
Seller, the Accounting Firm may submit written questions to either party
following the procedures set forth below in the Section titled "Submission of
Questions by the Accounting Firm." 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Upon receipt of the Rebuttal Report or notice waiving the right to file such
report from both the Purchaser and the Seller and receipt of all responses to
any written questions submitted by the Accounting Firm (and responses
thereto), the Accounting Firm will endeavor to issue a report containing its
findings within fifteen (15) calendar days after the later of (i) receiving
both the Purchaser's and the Seller's Rebuttal Reports or notice waiving the
right to file such report, as applicable, or (ii) any responses (if any) to
any written questions submitted by the Accounting Firm to either party
following the procedures set forth below in the Section titled "Submission of
Questions by the Accounting Firm." 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Unless requested by the Accounting Firm in writing pursuant to the terms of
the Section titled "Submission of Questions by the Accounting Firm", neither
the Purchaser nor the Seller may 

present any additional information or arguments to the Accounting Firm, either
orally or in writing.

| 
---|--- 

•

|

The Accounting Firm shall render its decision without conducting a hearing. 

Submission of Questions by the Accounting Firm

After receiving both Initial Reports and Rebuttal Reports, if any, the
Accounting Firm may submit written questions to the parties for written
responses or may direct requests for additional information, calculations, or
supporting documentation to the parties reasonably needed by the Accounting
Firm in order to clarify or understand any position or argument made by a
party in its written submission, in which case the parties agree to cooperate
with such requests (including by ensuring that the Accounting Firm is provided
copies of all relevant books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries)
in the manner and procedural timing described in this paragraph. If any such
questions are addressed to only one party, the Accounting Firm shall submit
the questions to that party, with a copy to the other parties. Once received,
the party to whom the questions are addressed shall have ten (10) Business
Days to answer the Accounting Firm's questions, and shall provide a copy of
its written answers to the other parties at the time they are provided to the
Accounting Firm. In response thereto, the other party may, within ten (10)
Business Days, submit a response to such answer(s) to the Accounting Firm and
shall provide a copy of a response to the other parties at the time it is
provided to the Accounting Firm. If any such questions are addressed to both
parties, each party shall have ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt
to respond to the Accounting Firm and shall provide a copy of its written
answers to the other parties at the time they are provided to the Accounting
Firm. In response thereto, each party may, within ten (10) Business Days,
submit a response to the other party's answer(s) to the Accounting Firm and
shall provide a copy to the other parties at the time it is provided to the
Accounting Firm.

Adjustment of Time Periods

If the due date for any written submissions to be submitted to the Accounting
Firm falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the written submission shall
take place on the next Business Day.

Communication between the Accounting Firm and the Parties

The parties agree not to engage in any ex parte communication with the
Accounting Firm except as specifically set forth herein.

The Accounting Firm will be required to include a representation in its
engagement letter that it has not discussed the disputed matter with either
party prior to its joint retention by the parties, and to include a covenant
in its engagement letter not to engage in ex parte communications (except as
specifically set forth herein) with either party throughout the course of the
engagement.

The engagement letter will specifically require the Accounting Firm to review
Section 2.04 of this Agreement, as well as any other provisions of this
Agreement deemed relevant by any of the Purchaser, the Seller or the
Accounting Firm.

Nature of Review by Accounting Firm

The Accounting Firm will make its determination in an objective, impartial
manner based on inquiry, investigation, and other procedures as it, in its
sole discretion may deem necessary, but in all cases consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and this Exhibit C. 

The Accounting Firm shall agree that between the time the Seller delivered the
Objection Notice to the Purchaser and the date on which the Accounting Firm is
engaged, the Purchaser and the Seller may have exchanged certain proposals
relating to the disputed items that were intended solely for purposes of
facilitating settlement discussions and such proposals were confidential and
were provided solely on the condition and understanding that such proposals
would not be permitted to be disclosed in any court or arbitration hearing,
including with respect to the Accounting Firm's engagement in the dispute. The
Accounting Firm will be instructed to disregard any evidence of such
settlement proposals and negotiations in its consideration of the disputed
matter.

Confidentiality

With respect to any information supplied in connection with the Accounting
Firm's engagement and designated by either party as confidential, or which
either party should reasonably believe is confidential based on the subject
matter or the circumstances of its disclosure, the other party agrees to
protect such confidential information in a reasonable and appropriate manner,
and use such confidential information only to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and for no other purpose. This will not apply to information
which is: (i) publicly known, (ii) already known to the recipient without
breach by the recipient of any obligation of confidentiality, (iii) lawfully
disclosed by a third party, (iv) independently developed without use or
referring to any confidential information, or (v) disclosed pursuant to legal
requirement or order (it being understood that any confidential information
that must be disclosed pursuant to legal requirement or order shall remain,
and shall continue to be treated as, confidential information).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no information (whether or not designated as
confidential) may be provided to the Accounting Firm without being made
available to all parties in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement
and this Exhibit C. The Accounting Firm shall not publicly disclose that it
has been retained to resolve any dispute relating to this Agreement or that
they are involved in the dispute, or any information relating to the dispute,
including their determination of the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including in each case each of the components thereof.

At the conclusion of the engagement contemplated hereby, any confidential
information made available hereunder, including copies thereof, shall be
returned or destroyed upon request by the disclosing party.

Other Procedural Matters

Procedural matters for the conduct of the dispute resolution, other than as
specified herein, will be determined by the Accounting Firm in consultation
with the Purchaser and the Seller; provided, however, that any such procedural
matters shall in all cases be consistent with the terms of this Agreement and
this Exhibit C.
