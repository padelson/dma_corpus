transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this
Agreement:

  

  

(a) on the Effective Date, Buyer agrees to pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller

billion six hundred and ninety million dollars ($1,690,000,000) (the " _Base
Purchase Price_ ") _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Closing Working Capital ((i) and
(ii), collectively, the " _Effective Date Payment_ "), pursuant to _Section

(b) on the Effective Date, Buyer agrees to assume the Assumed Obligations; and

  

  

(c) after the Effective Date, Buyer and Seller agree to make the adjustments
and payments described in _Section 3.2_ , as applicable.

  

  

Section 3.2. _Working Capital Adjustment_.

  

  

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth in reasonable
detail the Estimated Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "). The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared by Seller in
accordance with GAAP as modified by the methods, principles and categories
that were used to prepare the sample calculation of the Working Capital as of
June 30, 2017 as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(g)_ _(_ the " _Principles_ ");
_provided_ , that, in the event of a conflict between GAAP and the Principles,
the Principles shall prevail; _provided_ , _however_ , that all amounts
included in the Estimated Closing Statement shall reflect Seller's good faith
and reasonable estimates as of the point in time reflected therein based on
all information then available to Seller.

  

  

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), setting forth the
Working Capital as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior to
the Effective Date (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ") calculated in
accordance with the Principles.

  

  

 

20  

  

(c) During the thirty (30) day period following Seller's receipt of the
Closing Statement, Seller shall be permitted to review the working papers of
Buyer relating to the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall become
final and binding upon the Parties on the 30th day following delivery thereof
to Seller, unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement with the
Closing Statement (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such
date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall be signed by Seller and shall (i)
specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted, (ii)
only include disagreements based on mathematical errors, or based on the
Closing Working Capital not being calculated in accordance with _Section 3.2_
or the Principles, and (iii) specify what Seller reasonably believes is the
correct amount of the Closing Working Capital, including a reasonably detailed
description of the adjustments applied to the Closing Statement in calculating
such amount. If the Notice of Disagreement is received in a timely manner,
then the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence),
shall become final and binding upon Buyer and Seller on the earlier of (i) the
date Seller and Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (ii) the
date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting
Firm as provided below. During the thirty (30) day period following the
delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, if any, (i) Buyer and Seller shall
seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii)
Buyer shall have access to the working papers of Seller prepared in connection
with the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty (30) day period, if
Buyer and Seller have not resolved their disagreement, Buyer and Seller shall
submit to an independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for
resolution any matters that remain in dispute and which were properly included
in the Notice of Disagreement together with a brief written explanation of
each Party's position. The Accounting Firm shall be independent and mutually
agreeable to both Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct
the Accounting Firm that it (i) shall review only the matters that were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement which remain unresolved, (ii)
shall make its determination in accordance with the requirements of this
_Section 3.2_ , and (iii) shall render its decision within twenty (20) days
from the submission of such matters. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
Party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ shall
be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

  

  

(d) The fees, costs and expenses of Buyer incurred in connection with its
preparation of the Closing Statement, its review of any Notice of
Disagreement, and its preparation of any written brief submitted to the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer, and the fees, costs and expenses of
Seller incurred in connection with its preparation and review of the Closing
Statement, its preparation and certification of any Notice of Disagreement and
its preparation of any written brief submitted to the Accounting Firm shall be
borne by Seller.

  

  

(e) If the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Working
Capital, Buyer shall, or if the Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds the
Closing Working Capital, Seller shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the
Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties, make payment by
wire transfer of immediately available funds of the amount of such difference,
together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest from
time to time announced publicly by Citibank, N.A., as its prime rate,
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by three
hundred sixty five (365), from (and including) the Effective Date through (but
not including) the date of payment, to an account designated in writing by the
other Party. The difference between the Closing Working Capital and the
Estimated Closing Working Capital shall be allocated among the Purchased
Assets in accordance with the Allocation Schedule (set forth in _Section
7.9(a)_ below).

  

  

 

21  

  

(f) The Closing Statement, either as accepted or deemed to have been accepted
by Seller or as adjusted and resolved in the manner herein provided, shall fix
the Closing Working Capital, and the payment to be made as discussed in
_Section 3.2(e)_.

  

  

(g) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to whether there were mathematical errors in the Closing Statement and
whether the calculation of the Closing Working Capital was done in accordance
with this Agreement and the Principles, and the Accounting Firm is not to make
any other determination.

  

  

(h) Following the Closing, neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any action with
respect to the accounting books and records of the Business on which the
Closing Statement is to be based that is intended to obstruct, prevent or
otherwise affect the results of the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.2_
(including the amount of the Closing Working Capital or any other amount
included in the preparation of the Closing Statement). From and after the
Effective Date through the resolution of any adjustment contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_ , each of Buyer and Seller shall (i) assist, and shall cause its
Affiliates to assist, the other Party, its Affiliates, accountants, advisors
and other representatives in its preparation of the Closing Statement and the
Estimated Closing Statement and (ii) afford to the other Party, its
Affiliates, accountants, advisors and other representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books and records
of the Business to the extent relevant to the preparation of the Closing
Statement or any adjustment contemplated by this _Section 3.2_.

  

  

Section 3.3. _No Duplication_. For the avoidance of doubt, calculations of the
items described in this _Article III_ , including, without limitation, the
Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement, shall be calculated
without duplication.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

  

  

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedules, Seller hereby
represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

  

  

Section 5.1. _Organization and Good Standing_. Seller is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State
of New Jersey and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease, and operate the Purchased Assets and to carry on the Business as
presently conducted. Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
conduct of the Business, or the ownership or operation of any Purchased
Assets, by Seller makes such qualification necessary, except, in each case,
for any such failures that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.2. _Authority and Enforceability_. Seller has all corporate power
and authority, and has taken all required action on its part, necessary to
execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, and, subject to the
satisfaction of the closing conditions, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller, and (assuming the
due execution and delivery by Buyer) constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, or other similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of
creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity. At the Closing,
each of the Ancillary Agreements to which Seller is contemplated to be a party
will be duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and will (assuming
the due execution and delivery by each other Party thereto) constitute a valid
and binding agreement of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar laws affecting or
relating to enforcement of creditors' rights generally or general principles
of equity.

  

  

Section 5.3. _No Conflicts; Consents_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ ,
neither the execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, will:

  

  

(a) violate or conflict with any of Seller's Governing Documents in any
material respect;

  

  

 

24  

  

(b) assuming that all of the Buyer Required Regulatory Approvals and Seller
Required Regulatory Approvals have been made or obtained, and all conditions
therein which are then required to be satisfied have in fact been satisfied,
and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired, as the case may
be, violate any Law or Order applicable to Seller or any of the Purchased
Assets, except, for any such violations that (i) would not reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect Buyer's operation of the Business
or use of the Purchased Assets in the manner currently used or (ii) arise as a
result of any facts or circumstances relating particularly to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates;

  

  

(c) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of, require any consent or
approval of, or (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) constitute a
default under or pursuant to any Purchased Business Agreement, except, for any

occurrences that (i) would not reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect Buyer's operation of the Business or use of the Purchased
Assets in the manner currently used or (ii) arise as a result of any facts or
circumstances relating particularly to Buyer or any of its Affiliates; or

  

  

(d) other than the Seller Required Regulatory Approvals, require any
declaration, filing, or registration by Seller or any of its GAS Affiliates
with, or notice by Seller or any of its GAS Affiliates to, or authorization,
consent, or approval with respect to Seller or any of its GAS Affiliates of,
any Governmental Entity, except for any such declarations, filings,
registrations, notices, authorizations, consents, or approvals that (i) would
not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Buyer's
operation of the Business or use of the Purchased Assets in the manner
currently used or (ii) arise as a result of any facts or circumstances
particular to Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

been operated, in all material respects, in the ordinary course of business

(the " _Material Contracts_ "):

occupy any interest in real property is granted by or to Seller, except for

of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect and that do not individually involve
expenditures in excess of $3,000,000 in any one (1) year (excluding sales
orders and purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business);

  

  

(iv) all other agreements that individually involve expenditures in excess of
$3,000,000 in any one (1) year;

26  

  

(vi) all agreements for, or relating to, indebtedness, or pursuant to which

(viii) all agreements that, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, would limit the ability of Buyer to compete in any line of business or

(ix) all partnership, joint venture and joint ownership agreements, and all
similar material agreements (however named) relating to the Business,

accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect. Seller has made
available to Buyer copies of each Material Contract together with all
amendments, waivers, or other changes thereto, which are correct and complete

respect or (B) has repudiated or is challenging any material provision of any
Material Contract.

since January 1, 2015 has been, in compliance with all Laws, Orders and
Permits applicable to the Purchased Assets or the Business, except for

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.9(b)_ , Seller possesses all Permits
necessary to own and operate the Business and Purchased Assets as currently
operated, all of such Permits are in full force and effect, and no appeal or
other proceeding is pending or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened in writing
to revoke any such Permits, except where the failure to have such Permit or
for such Permit to be in effect would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.10. _Real Property_.

  

  

(a) _Schedule 2.2(a)(i)_ sets forth a true and correct legal description of
all Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property.

interests in the Leased Real Property and all improvements thereon (to the
extent leased by Seller), free and clear of all Encumbrances except Permitted
Encumbrances and except as would not reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect Buyer's operation of the Business or use of the Purchased
Assets in the manner currently used. Except as otherwise provided in _Schedule

To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no unrecorded outstanding options,
rights of first offer or rights of first refusal to purchase the Owned Real
Property, the Conveyed Easements, or any portion thereof or interest therein.

  

  

(c) All of the Leases are in full force and effect and (i) Seller is not in
default (and has not taken or failed to take any action which with notice, the
passage of time, or both, would constitute a default) under the terms of any
Lease and, to the Knowledge of Seller, Seller has not received written notice
of material default under any Lease which has not been cured within the
applicable grace periods and (ii) to the Knowledge of Seller, no landlord is
in material default under any Lease.

  

  

(d) There is no pending condemnation, eminent domain or similar proceeding
affecting the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property or any portion
thereof, and, to the Seller's Knowledge, Seller has not received any written
notice that any such proceeding is contemplated. To the Knowledge of Seller,
there is no pending condemnation or similar proceeding affecting any Conveyed
Easement (or any portion thereof) and Seller has not received any written
notice that any such proceeding is contemplated.

  

  

(e) To the Knowledge of Seller, Seller has not received any written notice of
existing, pending or threatened zoning, building code or other moratorium
proceedings, or similar matters which would adversely affect the ability of
Buyer to operate the Business as currently conducted in any material respect.
As of the date hereof, neither the whole nor any material portion of the Real
Property has been damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty.

  

  

Section 5.11. _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.11_

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

hereunder will be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by
either Party in connection therewith. Each Party shall retain such books and
records for a period of seven (7) years from the Effective Date.

not disclose any Confidential Information to any Person other than its
Affiliates and Buyer's Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that upon the
Closing, the provisions of this _Section 7.3_ will expire with respect to any
information to the extent primarily related to the Purchased Assets or the
Business (" _Business Confidential Information_ "). " _Confidential
Information_ " means all information in any form heretofore or hereafter

public domain through no violation of this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement by Buyer, its Affiliates, or Buyer's Representatives.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may disclose Confidential Information
to the extent that such information is required to be disclosed by Buyer by
Law or in connection with any proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity,
including any disclosure, financial or otherwise, required to comply with the
rules of any securities commission or exchange. In the event that Buyer
believes any such disclosure is required, Buyer will give Seller notice
thereof as promptly as possible and, at Seller's expense, will cooperate with
Seller in seeking any protective orders or other relief as Seller may
reasonably request.

  

  

(c) If the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, Buyer will
promptly return to Seller or destroy all copies of any Confidential
Information in accordance with the terms of, and as required by, the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

 

36  

  

(d) If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, to the extent
Confidential Information is Business Confidential Information, and only to
such extent, the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby expressly superseded by
this _Section 7.3_.

  

  

Section 7.4. _Confidentiality by Seller to Buyer_. For a period of two (2)
years following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and Representatives and the
Representatives of its respective Affiliates to hold, in confidence any and
all Business Confidential Information, except to the extent that such
information: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by Seller in violation of the terms of this _Section
7.4_ ; (b) was lawfully acquired by Seller, any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives from and after the Closing from sources not known
to be prohibited from disclosing such information to such Person by an
obligation of confidentiality to Buyer or (c) is developed independently by
Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
without the use of Business Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that
such information is required to be disclosed by Seller by Law or in connection
with any proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity, including any
disclosure, financial or otherwise, required to comply with the rules of any
securities commission or exchange. In the event that Seller believes any such
disclosure is required, Seller will give Buyer notice thereof as promptly as
possible and, at Buyer's expense, will cooperate with Buyer in seeking any
protective orders or other relief as Buyer may reasonably request.

  

  

Section 7.5. _Transition Services_. For a period not to exceed twelve (12)
months following the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to Buyer and its Affiliates such of the services currently provided by
Seller or its Affiliates to the Business as Buyer may request, which services
are to be provided in substantially the same manner and at the same level as
such services are presently provided by Seller or its Affiliates, and Buyer
and its Affiliates shall reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for such services
at the fully-loaded costs as specified on _Schedule 7.5_.

  

  

Section 7.6. _Expenses_. Except for Transfer Taxes as provided in _Section
7.9(h)_ below, Buyer shall bear sole responsibility for payment of all filing,
recording, transfer, or other fees or charges of any nature in connection any
Required Regulatory Approvals or otherwise payable pursuant to any provision
of any Law, Order or Franchise in connection with the sale, transfer, and
assignment by Seller of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Obligations to
Buyer. Except as provided in the foregoing or to the extent otherwise
specifically provided herein, and irrespective of whether the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, all other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will
be borne by the Party incurring such costs and expenses.

  

  

Section 7.7. _Further Assurances; Wrong Pockets_.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
7.8_ , each of the Parties will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to
obtain satisfaction of the conditions precedent to each Party's obligations
hereunder.

  

  

 

37  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
the contrary, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall not constitute
an agreement to transfer or assign any contract, agreement, permit, claim or
right or any benefit or obligation arising thereunder or resulting therefrom
if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party,
would constitute a breach or other contravention under any agreement or Law to
which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party or by which it is bound, or
in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates or,
upon transfer, Buyer under such contract, agreement, permit, claim or right.
Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, promptly
following the date hereof, any and all consents of third parties required to
assign to Buyer Seller's rights under the Purchased Business Agreements. Buyer
agrees to take reasonable actions to cooperate with Seller in Seller's efforts
to obtain any consents of third parties required to assign to Buyer Seller's
rights under the Purchased Business Agreements, including the submission of
reasonable, financial or other information concerning Buyer and the execution
of any assumption agreements or similar documents reasonably requested by a
third party provided that such agreements or documents are consistent with the
terms hereof. To the extent that, notwithstanding its commercially reasonable
efforts, Seller is unable to obtain any such required consent prior to the
Closing, and as a result thereof Buyer shall be prevented by such third party
from receiving the rights and benefits with respect to such Purchased Asset
intended to be transferred hereunder, or if any attempted assignment would
adversely affect the rights of Seller thereunder so that Buyer would not in
fact receive all such rights or Seller would forfeit or otherwise lose the
benefit of rights that Seller is entitled to retain, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate to resolve the matter in accordance with _Section 2.6_. Without in
any way limiting the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII,
Buyer agrees that other than liability arising from a failure to comply with
this _Section 7.7_ and _Section 7.8_ or a breach of Seller's representations
and warranties set forth in _Article V_ hereof, Seller shall not have any
liability to Buyer arising out of the failure to obtain any such consent that
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or because of any circumstances
resulting therefrom.

  

  

(c) To the extent that, notwithstanding its commercially reasonable efforts,
Seller is unable to meet ISRA property transfer requirements prior to the
Effective Date for any Real Property, such Real Property shall be excluded
from the Purchased Assets at Closing (" _Holdback Property_ ") and leased to
the Buyer until ISRA property transfer requirements are satisfied. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate in developing a lease for any Holdback Property to
reflect the rights, benefits, and obligations that would otherwise have
applied as of the Closing to the maximum extent feasible and shall close on
the transfer of the Holdback Property to Buyer as soon as commercially
reasonable following satisfaction of ISRA property transfer requirements.

  

  

(d) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute and deliver such
further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional action
as Buyer may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the
sale and transfer to Buyer of the Purchased Assets and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, execute and deliver such further instruments of assumption and take such
additional action as Seller may reasonably request to effect, consummate,
confirm or evidence the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

38  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if at any time following
the Closing it becomes apparent that any Purchased Asset (including any
contract) that should have been transferred to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement was not so transferred, or any Excluded Asset was inadvertently
transferred to Buyer, Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates
to, or Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, as applicable, in each
case as promptly as practicable, (i) transfer all rights, title and interest
in (A) such Purchased Asset to Buyer or as Buyer may direct, or (B) such
Excluded Asset to Seller or as Seller may direct, as applicable, in each case
for no additional consideration; and (ii) hold its right, title and interest
in and to such Purchased Asset or Excluded Asset, as applicable, in trust for
the applicable transferee until such time as such transfer is completed.

  

  

Section 7.8. _Governmental Approvals_.

  

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Seller and
Buyer will each file or cause to be filed with the NJBPU, joint applications
for approval of the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller and Buyer will,
and will cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other and
use reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly prepare and file all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, and filings and execute all agreements and
documents, to the extent required by Law or Order for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Required Regulatory
Approvals and compliance with ISRA), (ii) obtain the transfer to Buyer of all
Transferable Permits and the reissuance to Buyer of all Permits that are not
Transferable Permits, and (iii) obtain the consents, approvals, and
authorizations of all Governmental Entities to the extent required by Law or
Order for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Required Regulatory Approvals). Each Party will, and will cause
its Affiliates to, consult and cooperate with the other Party as to the
appropriate time of all such filings and notifications, furnish to the other
Party such necessary information and reasonable assistance in connection with
the preparation of such filings, and respond promptly to any requests for
additional information made in connection therewith by any Governmental
Entity. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, Seller and Buyer each
will have the right to review in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to it or to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which appear in any filing made by the other Party or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition to the foregoing, each Party agrees that prior to the Closing, other
than in the ordinary course of business, (x) it will not include in any such
applications, notices, petitions or filings to or with the NJBPU, any requests
or proposals that any business subject to the NJBPU's jurisdiction receive
more favorable treatment (whether through increased rates, more favorable
terms of service, or otherwise, to such Party or any of its Affiliates) than
is currently applicable and (y) it will not separately file or make any
applications, notices, petitions or filings to or with the NJBPU that are in
any way inconsistent with obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

39  

  

(b) To the fullest extent practicable and permitted by Law, in connection with
any communications, meetings, or other contacts, oral or written, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
each Party shall (and will cause its Affiliates to): (i) inform the other
Party in advance of any such communication, meeting, or other contact which
such Party or any of its Affiliates proposes or intends to make, including the
subject matter, contents, intended agenda, and other aspects of any of the
foregoing; (ii) consult and cooperate with the other Party, and to take into
account the comments of the other Party in connection with any of the matters
covered by _Section 7.8(a)_ ; (iii) permit for representatives of the other
Party to participate to the maximum extent possible in any such
communications, meetings, or other contacts; (iv) notify the other Party of
any oral communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the
foregoing; and (v) provide the other Party with copies of all written
communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing.
Nothing in this _Section 7.8(b)_ will apply to or restrict communications or
other actions by a Party with or with respect to any Governmental Entity in
connection with its business in the ordinary course of business.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, take any action, including (i) acquiring any asset,
property, business or Person (by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange,
investment, or other business combination, asset, stock or equity purchase, or
otherwise), (ii) making any filing or transfer or (iii) taking any other
action, that in each case could reasonably be expected to materially increase
the risk of not obtaining any consent contemplated by this Section 7.8. In
furtherance of and without limiting any of Buyer's covenants and agreements
under this _Section 7.8_ , Buyer shall, and shall cause each Affiliate to,
take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause to be
made, any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining
the Required Regulatory Approvals, so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable, including (i) agreeing to conditions imposed by, or
taking any action required by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) defending through
litigation on the merits, including appeals, any Claim asserted by any court
or other proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Entity, that
seeks to or could prevent or prohibit or impede, interfere with or delay the
consummation of the Closing; (iii) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets or business of Buyer or
its Affiliates or the Purchased Assets, including entering into customary
ancillary agreements relating to any such sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition; (iv) agreeing to any limitation on the conduct of Buyer or its
Affiliates, including after the Closing with respect to the Purchased Assets;
and (v) agreeing to take any other action as may be required by a Governmental
Entity in order to effect each of the following: (1) obtaining all Required
Regulatory Approvals as soon as reasonably possible and in any event before
the Termination Date, (2) avoiding the entry of, or having vacated, lifted,
dissolved, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of, or impedes, interferes with or delays, the Closing and (3)
effecting the expiration or termination of any waiting period, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing, prohibiting or restricting
consummation of the Closing or impeding, interfering with or delaying the
Closing, in each case as may be required in order to obtain the Required
Regulatory Approvals or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the lifting or
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
delaying the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required to, and Seller shall
not, in connection with obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals, consent
to or take any action with respect to the Purchased Assets, in each case,
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Business taken as a whole. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the exclusions set forth in the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" shall be deemed to apply to any reference to "material adverse effect"
in this _Section 7.8(c)_.

  

  

 

40  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller shall not be required to, and Buyer shall not, in connection
with obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals, consent to (x) the taking of
any action or the imposition of any terms, conditions, limitations or
standards of service the effectiveness or consummation of which is not
conditional upon the occurrence of the Closing or (y) the imposition of any
terms, conditions or limitations on or with respect to Seller, any of its
Affiliates, any of their respective businesses or any of the benefits to
Seller and its Affiliates of the transactions.

  

  

Section 7.9. _Tax Matters_.

  

  

(a) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The sum of the Purchase Price and the
Assumed Obligations (plus any other liabilities treated as assumed for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) will be allocated among the Purchased Assets in
accordance with the principles of section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
thereunder (and any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law, as appropriate) pursuant to an allocation schedule (each an " _Allocation
Schedule_ ") to be prepared by Buyer. Buyer shall deliver to Seller an initial
Allocation Schedule within one hundred twenty (120) days of the Effective
Date. If any indemnification payment is made pursuant to _Article IX_ or any
other adjustment to the Purchase Price occurs, Buyer shall promptly revise any
affected Allocation Schedules to take into account such payment or adjustment
in a manner consistent with the principles of section 1060 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder (and any corresponding provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, as appropriate). Buyer shall provide the Allocation Schedule
(and any revision to the Allocation Schedule necessitated by an adjustment of
the Purchase Price) to Seller for Seller's review and comment. Seller shall
provide any comments to Buyer within forty-five (45) days of receiving the
Allocation Schedule (or any revision to the Allocation Schedule). Buyer shall
consider Seller's comments in good faith. If Buyer objects to Seller's
comments, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to settle
the dispute with respect to such comments promptly. If Buyer and Seller have
not resolved such dispute within thirty (30) days of Buyer's receipt of
Seller's comments, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain a nationally
recognized tax expert (a " _Tax Dispute Referee_ ") to resolve disputed items.
The findings of the Tax Dispute Referee shall be final and binding on the
Parties. Upon final resolution of disputed items, the Allocation Schedule
shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Tax Dispute Referee incurred in connection with a dispute relating to the
Allocation Schedule shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Buyer and
Seller hereby covenant and agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Schedules
for all income Tax purposes, (ii) prepare and file all Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with each such Allocation Schedule and (iii) not take any position
on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Entity charged with the collection
of any Tax, or in any judicial proceeding that is in any way inconsistent with
the terms of any such Allocation Schedule unless required to do so by
applicable Law. Each Party will provide the other promptly with any other
information required to complete Form 8594 under the Code.

  

  

 

41  

  

(b) _Responsibility for Taxes_. Seller shall bear sole responsibility for the
payment of, and shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates from, (i) all Pre-
Closing Taxes and (ii) Seller's share of any Transfer Taxes under _Section
7.9(h)_. Buyer shall bear sole responsibility for the payment of, and shall
indemnify Seller and its Affiliates from, (i) all Post-Closing Taxes and (ii)
Buyer's share of any Transfer Taxes under _Section 7.9(h)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for _Section 9.3(d)_ ,
_Section 9.3(e)_ , _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_ and _Section 9.6_ , the provisions of
_Article IX_ shall not apply to this _Section 7.9_.

  

  

(c) _Proration of Straddle Tax Period Taxes_. In the case of any Taxes (other
than Transfer Taxes) that are payable for a Straddle Tax Period, the portion
of such Taxes that are Pre-Closing Taxes shall (i) in the case of any real and
personal property Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Taxable Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount
of time from the beginning of the relevant Taxable Period to the Effective
Time and the denominator of which is the amount of time in the entire Taxable
Period and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, be equal to the portion of
such Tax that would have been payable if the relevant Taxable Period ended at
the Effective Time. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (ii) shall be made in a manner
consistent with prior practice of Seller, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the type of Taxes
being allocated, any item attributable to any action taken by Buyer during a
Straddle Tax Period after the Effective Time that is not in the ordinary
course of business will not be attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and
any Taxes resulting from such actions shall be borne solely by Buyer.

  

  

(d) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. Buyer shall timely prepare and
file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns with respect to the
Business or the Purchased Assets for any Straddle Tax Period. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared and filed in accordance with past practices and the
requirements of this Agreement except to the extent required by Law. Buyer
shall provide any such Tax Return to Seller for Seller's review and comment at
least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return.
Buyer shall consider Seller's comments in good faith. If Buyer objects to
Seller's comments, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to settle the dispute with respect to such comments promptly. If Buyer and
Seller have not resolved such dispute at least twenty (20) days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Return, Seller and Buyer shall jointly retain a
Tax Dispute Referee to resolve disputed items. The findings of the Tax Dispute
Referee shall be final and binding on the Parties. Upon final resolution of
disputed items, the Tax Return shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution.
Buyer shall timely pay in the manner required by applicable Law to the
relevant tax authority all Taxes that are shown as due on such Tax Returns.
Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to any Pre-Closing Taxes shown as
due on any Tax Return for a Straddle Tax Period no later than five (5) days
before any such Tax is due unless there is a dispute that has not been
resolved by such date, in which case Seller shall pay Buyer the amount of such
disputed Tax within five (5) days of the resolution of such disputed Tax. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Tax Dispute Referee incurred in connection
with a dispute relating to a Tax Return shall be borne equally by Seller and
Buyer.

  

  

 

42  

  

(e) _Tax Contests_. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate with each other to the
extent reasonably required after the Effective Date in connection with any Tax
Contests relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Tax Period.
Promptly (but no more than twenty (20) days) after Buyer (or any of its
Affiliates) or Seller (or any of its Affiliates) receives notice of any such
Tax Contest, the party receiving the notice shall notify the other party in
writing of the Tax Contest; provided, however, that failure to provide such
notice shall not relieve any Party of its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 7.9_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such
Party. Seller shall control all Tax Contests relating exclusively to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods. Additionally, if Seller's Tax liability could be affected
by a Tax Contest relating to a Straddle Tax Period or if Seller could have an
indemnification obligation under this Agreement with respect thereto, Seller
shall have the right to conduct and control the defense of such Tax Contest at
its expense, and Buyer shall provide Seller with all necessary powers of
attorney and other documents and assistance reasonably requested by Seller to
allow Seller to effectively conduct and control such defense. Seller shall not
be responsible for any Taxes to the extent attributable to any action taken by
Buyer with respect to any Tax Contest without Seller's written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld). This _Section 7.9(e)_ , rather than _Section 9.3_ ,
shall govern control of all Third Party Claims that relate to Taxes.

  

  

(f) _Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished
to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets (including access
to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by any tax authority, and the prosecution or defense
of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to furnish or cause to be
furnished any Tax Returns or provide access to any books or records to the
extent not related to the Business or the Purchased Assets. Buyer and Seller
shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the
Business and the Purchased Assets for a period of at least seven (7) years
following the Effective Date. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving
the Business or the Purchased Assets.

  

  

(g) _Tax Refunds_. Any refund or credit received by Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer with respect to Pre-Closing Taxes, whether such refund is received as a
payment or as a credit, abatement or similar offset against future Taxes
payable, shall be for the account of Seller. Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amount of any such refund or credit within five (5) days after receipt.

  

  

(h) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and any transactions contemplated by such
agreements shall be borne and paid, or caused to be paid, by Buyer and Seller
equally. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to minimize the incurrence of any
such Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in timely making and
filing all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the provisions of
laws relating to such Transfer Taxes. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, Seller will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and related documentation. To
the extent any Tax Return with respect to Transfer Taxes is required by
applicable Law to be filed by Seller and Buyer provides Seller with reasonable
notice of such requirement, Seller will file such Tax Return and other
documentation and pay any amount of Tax shown as due on such Tax Return, and
Buyer shall pay to Seller one-half of the amount of Tax shown as due for any
such Tax Return no later than five (5) days before any such Tax is due and, if
required by applicable Law, shall join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and related documentation. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in
providing each other with any appropriate resale exemption certifications and
other similar documentation.

  

  

 

43  

  

(i) _Seller Consolidated Tax Returns_. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements, Seller shall have the exclusive right to control all
matters, including all Tax Contests, relating to any consolidated, combined or
unitary group of corporations that includes Seller or any Affiliate of Seller,
and Seller shall not be required to provide copies of any Tax Returns with
respect thereto to Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

(j) _Post-Closing Covenants_. Except as permitted by _Section 7.9(d)_ or
_Section 7.9(e)_ , or otherwise with the prior written consent of Seller,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (a) amend, refile,
revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (b) make any Tax election or change any accounting
period or method with retroactive effect to any such Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(c) take any action to extend the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (d) surrender any
right to claim a refund of any Pre-Closing Taxes, or (e) take any similar
action relating to Pre-Closing Taxes or Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax
Periods.

  

  

Section 7.10. _Employees_.

  

  

(a) _Schedule 7.10(a)_ sets forth a list of the Business Employees together
with each such Business Employee's date of hire, years of service, and base
pay in effect as of the date hereof, and status as an employee covered by the
Labor Agreement. Business Employees covered by the Labor Agreement are
hereafter referred to as " _Represented Employees_ ". In the event that any
Business Employee ceases to be employed by Seller or its Affiliates prior to
the Effective Time, Seller by delivery of written notice thereof to Buyer,
shall promptly update _Schedule 7.10(a)_ to remove from such list the name of
such person.

  

  

(b) Subject to this _Section 7.10(b)_ , Buyer will give Qualifying Offers of
employment to each of the Business Employees at least fifteen (15) Business
Days prior to the anticipated Effective Date or a later date approved by
Seller in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. As used
herein, a " _Qualifying Offer_ " means an offer by Buyer to continue "at-will"
employment with the Business commencing at the Closing (i) at a level of base
pay (and bonus opportunity) at least equal to such employee's base pay (and
bonus opportunity) in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and as
set forth on _Schedule 7.10(a)_ , (ii) with an initial primary work location
within a thirty (30) mile radius from such employee's primary work location
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) with compensation and
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and
benefits (including equity-based compensation and severance benefits) provided
to such Business Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. All
Qualifying Offers of employment made by Buyer pursuant to this _Section
7.10(b)_ will be made in accordance with all applicable Laws, will be
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and will include such additional
information as shall be mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer. Each Business
Employee who is given a Qualifying Offer and who accepts an offer of
employment from Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.10(b)_ is referred to herein
as a " _Transferred Employee_."

  

  

 

44  

  

(c) Upon the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates will terminate the employment
of all Transferred Employees with Seller and its Affiliates. On and after the
Effective Time, Buyer shall be solely responsible for any and all Losses
related to any Business Employee and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller from and against any such Losses.

  

  

(d) Through the Effective Time, Seller or its Affiliate will maintain the
short term disability and long term disability plans or programs, worker's
compensation and any related insurance policies or other funding or
administrative arrangements, presently in effect with respect to the Business
Employees, and will handle any claim for benefits thereunder in the ordinary
course of business. Prior to the Closing, Seller or its Affiliate will take
all steps reasonably necessary and appropriate to transfer and assign all such
insurance policies and other funding arrangements and Seller's or its
Affiliate's rights to Buyer effective as of the Effective Time, at which time
Buyer will assume responsibility for all such disability benefits in respect
to the Transferred Employees. If Seller, its Affiliate or the insurance
carrier of Seller or its Affiliate makes any payments for worker's
compensation, short term disability or long term disability to or on behalf of
any Transferred Employee that are the responsibility of Buyer as provided in
this Agreement, Buyer shall reimburse Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable,
for the payments, promptly after receipt of any accounting statement from
Seller, to the extent of Seller's or its Affiliate's out-of-pocket costs
therefor.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Date, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and Buyer
shall take all action reasonably necessary in order for Buyer to become a
successor to Seller's obligations under the Labor Agreement, effective for
periods after the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the liabilities and
obligations under the Labor Agreement shall be assumed only to the extent that
such liabilities and obligations arise, relate to and are required to be
performed during periods after the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 7.11. _Employee Benefits_.

  

  

(a) As of the Effective Time and for a period expiring at the end of the first
full calendar year following the year in which the Closing occurs (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Buyer will (i) allow each of the Transferred
Employees to participate in Buyer-sponsored benefit plans on a similar basis
as made available by Buyer to its other employees who are similarly situated
after taking into account such Transferred Employee's service with Seller or
an Affiliate of Seller, (ii) provide to each Transferred Employee base pay
that is not less than such Transferred Employee's base pay immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (iii) provide each Transferred Employee with
compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation and benefits (including equity-based compensation and severance
benefits) provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If any Transferred Employee's employment is terminated within
the Continuation Period, Buyer will provide such Transferred Employee with
severance benefits pursuant to the terms of Buyer's applicable severance plan
or policy; provided, however, that, in accordance with _Section 7.10(b)_ ,
above, the calculation of any such severance benefits shall take into account
such Transferred Employee's service with Seller or an Affiliate of Seller. The
form and terms of any particular benefit plan offered by Buyer (" _Buyer
Benefit Plan_ ") shall be as determined by Buyer, subject to the foregoing and
the other provisions of this _Section 7.11_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this _Section 7.11(a)_ shall not apply to Represented Employees, the terms and
conditions of whose employment shall be as set out in the Labor Agreement (as
it may be amended from time-to-time) and applicable Law.

  

  

 

45  

  

(b) Buyer will recognize the service and seniority of each of the Transferred
Employees recognized by Seller for all benefits purposes, including
eligibility for, vesting and accrual of, and determination of the levels of
such benefits. However, service will not be recognized to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

  

  

(c) Seller shall fully vest all Transferred Employees in their account
balances under the retirement savings plan in which such Transferred Employees
participate (the " _Seller 's 401(k) Plan_"), effective as of the Effective
Time. Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall maintain or designate,
or cause to be maintained or designated, a defined contribution plan and
related trust intended to be qualified under sections 401(a), 401(k) and
501(a) of the Code (the " _Buyer 's 401(k) Plan_"). Effective as of the
Effective Time, the Transferred Employees shall cease participation in
Seller's 401(k) Plan. The Transferred Employees shall be eligible to
participate and shall commence participation in Buyer's 401(k) Plan in
accordance with the terms of Buyer's 401(k) Plan. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate and take, or cause to be taken, reasonable best efforts to permit
each Transferred Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of section 401(a)(31) of the Code) to
Buyer's 401(k) Plan in cash in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributed to such Transferred Employee from Seller's 401(k) Plan. Buyer will
use reasonable best efforts to permit such rollover contributions in the form
of notes representing an employee loan under Seller's 401(k) Plan and Buyer
shall take (or cause to be taken) any and all reasonable action as may be
required to provide that Transferred Employees may continue to service any
such loans through payroll deductions after the Closing. Seller shall fully
vest all Transferred Employees in their account balances under Seller's
nonqualified savings plan, effective as of the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) With regard to the AGL Resources Inc. Retirement Plan or the successor
plan thereto (the " _Seller Pension Plan_ "), each Pension Participant shall
cease to be a participant under such plan effective as of the Effective Time.
Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall have in effect a tax-qualified
defined benefit pension plan (the " _Buyer Pension Plan_ " which may, for the
avoidance of doubt, be a preexisting plan of Buyer) with benefits and other
terms and conditions equivalent to the Seller Pension Plan, in each case, in
which the Pension Participants shall be eligible to participate. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Seller shall cause the calculation and
transfer to the Buyer Pension Plan of assets equal to (i) the amount required
to be transferred pursuant to Section 414(l) of the Code, Treasury Regulation
Section 1.414(l)-1(n)(2) (unless the requirements of such section cannot be
satisfied) and such other applicable law using the actuarial assumptions and
methodology consistent with those used by Seller in its measurement of the
accumulated benefit obligation of the Seller Pension Plan under Accounting
Standards Codification Section 715 (the " _ABO_ ") with respect to the Pension
Participants, as determined by the Seller's actuaries as of the Effective
Time, (for the avoidance of doubt, such actuarial assumptions and methodology
are agreed by Seller and Buyer to satisfy the reasonability requirements
specified in Section 414(l) of the Code), subject to any requirements under
such Section of the Code and ERISA (the " _Section 414(l) Amount_ "); plus
(ii) for the period between the Effective Time and the date such assets are
transferred (the " _Transfer Date_ "), an interest increment on the Section
414(l) Amount at the rate equal to the yield on the three month US Treasury
Bill rate as of the Effective Time; less (iii) any benefit payments that are
made from the Seller Pension Plan to each Pension Participant for the period
between the Effective Time and the Transfer Date; less (iv) any costs or
expenses incurred by Seller in respect of Pension Participant benefits of the
Seller Pension Plan for the period between the Effective Time and the Transfer
Date. The transfer of the amount from the Seller Pension Plan to the Buyer
Pension Plan shall be made in cash. Such transfer shall be subject to Seller's
receipt of a current determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
indicating that the Buyer Pension Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code. The Buyer Pension Plan shall recognize and credit all service
(including, without limitation, for purposes of benefit accrual) of the
Pension Participants credited under the Seller Pension Plan. Following such
transfer from the Seller Pension Plan to the Buyer Pension Plan, the Seller
Pension Plan shall have no liability to or with respect to any Pension
Participant with respect to their accrued benefits under the Seller Pension
Plan, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from all liabilities, costs and expenses that may result to Seller or such
Affiliates or the Seller Pension Plan from any claim by or on behalf of any
Pension Participant for any benefit alleged to be payable under the Seller
Pension Plan. To the extent that the amount of assets transferred to the Buyer
Pension Plan pursuant to this _Section 7.11(d)_ is less than the ABO (i.e.,
because of the operation of Section 414(l) of the Code), Seller shall pay
Buyer the difference in cash at the same time the plan-to-plan asset transfer
is effected.

  

  

 

46  

  

(e) Buyer agrees to provide those employees whose work responsibilities
related primarily to the Business, and who retired prior to the Closing, and
who are listed on _Schedule 7.11(e)_ with benefits that are equivalent to
those benefits that would have been available to those employees had they
remained covered under the Health and Welfare Plan for Retirees and Inactive
Employees of AGL Resources, Inc. for a period of two (2) years from the
Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the assets and
liabilities associated with those employees whose work responsibilities
related primarily to the Business in the NUI Corporation Employee Welfare
Trust (the " _Welfare Trust_ ") shall be transferred to a voluntary employees
beneficiary association plan maintained by Buyer (the " _Buyer VEBA_ "). The
assets shall be transferred in cash. The amount of assets transferred shall be
determined based on a pro-rata allocation of the Welfare Trust assets using
the retiree medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (the "
_APBO_ ") covered under the Welfare Trust for the group for whom the transfer
is effected compared to the APBO for all benefits covered under the Welfare
Trust. For the avoidance of doubt, the retiree life APBO to be transferred to
the Buyer does not have any corresponding assets under the Welfare Trust.

  

  

(f) Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to waive or cause the waiver of any
limitation on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work
exclusions and waiting periods for the Transferred Employees under a Buyer
Benefit Plan that provides group medical benefits to the extent that such
limitations are waived or otherwise inapplicable to a Transferred Employee
under any comparable plan of Seller as of the Effective Date. All health care
expenses incurred by Transferred Employees or any eligible dependent thereof,
including any alternate recipient pursuant to qualified medical child support
orders, in the portion of the calendar year preceding the Effective Date that
were qualified to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any
deductible or out-of-pocket limit under any Seller health care plans will be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket
limit under the health care plan of Buyer for such calendar year.

  

  

 

47  

  

(g) Seller will be responsible for providing COBRA Continuation Coverage to
any current and former employees of Seller, or to any qualified beneficiaries
of such employees, who become entitled to COBRA Continuation Coverage as a
result of loss of medical coverage under a Benefit Plan maintained by Seller
or any of its ERISA Affiliates. Buyer will be responsible for offering and
providing COBRA Continuation Coverage to any Transferred Employees (and their
qualified beneficiaries) who become entitled to such COBRA Continuation
Coverage on or after the Closing as a result of their loss of medical coverage
under any Buyer Benefit Plan.

  

  

(h) Seller hereby acknowledges that, for Federal Insurance Contributions Act
and Federal Unemployment Tax Act tax purposes, Buyer qualifies as a successor
employer with respect to the Transferred Employees. In connection with the
foregoing, the parties agree to follow the "Alternative Procedures" set forth
in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320. In connection with
the application of the "Alternative Procedures," (i) Seller and Buyer each
shall report on a predecessor-successor basis as set forth in such Revenue
Procedure, (ii) _provided_ , that Seller provides to Buyer all necessary
payroll records for the calendar year that includes the Effective Time, Seller
shall be relieved from furnishing Forms W-2 to employees of Seller or its
Affiliates that become employees of Buyer, and (iii) _provided_ , that Seller
provides to Buyer all necessary payroll records for the calendar year that
includes the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume the obligations of Seller to
furnish such Forms W-2 to such employees for the full calendar year in which
the Closing occurs.

  

  

(i) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
_Section 7.10_ and this _Section 7.11_ are included for the sole benefit of
Buyer and Seller, and that nothing contained herein, express or implied, is
intended to (i) confer upon any Person (including any Business Employee) any
right to continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any
specific employee benefit, (ii) constitute an amendment to or any other
modification of any employee benefit plan, program or agreement of any kind or
(iii) create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person,
including any Business Employees (or representatives thereof), former Business
Employees, any participant in any benefit plan or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power
of Buyer, Seller or any of their Affiliates to amend or terminate any
particular employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy.

  

  

Section 7.12. _Signage_. Within ninety (90) days following Closing, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Business to, cease using Seller Marks including
removing Seller Marks from the Purchased Assets or any properties or assets
relating to the Business, and Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Business
not to, use Seller Marks or any logos, Trademarks or trade names belonging to
Seller or any Affiliate thereof, and Buyer acknowledges that it and its
Affiliates have no rights whatsoever to use Seller Marks or such logos,
Trademarks or trade names or related Intellectual Property. Notwithstanding
Buyer's right to use Seller Marks for the time periods set forth above, Buyer
agrees that (a) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be deemed an
agent, representative or joint venture partner of Seller; (b) Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain sole and exclusive ownership of Seller Marks, and all
goodwill and rights related thereto; and (c) Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not knowingly take any action in respect of Seller Marks that would adversely
affect Seller or its Affiliates, or the interest of Seller or its Affiliates
in the Seller Marks.

  

  

 

48  

  

Section 7.13. _Insurance Settlement; Cooperation_.

  

  

(a) Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller to take such steps as may be
reasonably necessary to finalize and implement the insurance settlements
negotiated by Seller prior to Closing with respect to the certain insurance
policies of Seller as described in more detail on _Schedule 7.13(a)_.

  

  

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer and Seller will cooperate on the matters set
forth on _Schedule 7.13(b)_ (the " _Other Indemnified Matters_ ").

  

  

Section 7.14. _Notification of Customers_. As soon as practicable following
the Closing, Seller and Buyer will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be sent to customers of the Business written
notice that such customers have been transferred from Seller to Buyer. Such
notice will contain such information as is required by Law and approved by
Buyer and Seller, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

  

Section 7.15. _Public Statements_. No Party hereto shall issue, or permit any
of its Affiliates or Representatives to issue, any press release or otherwise
make any public statements or announcements regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the
other Party, except as otherwise determined to be necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable Law or any rules or regulations of any supervisory,
regulatory or other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over it or any of
its Affiliates (including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New
York Stock Exchange), in which case the Party required to issue such press
release or public announcement shall use reasonable efforts to provide the
other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or
public announcement in advance of such publication. The Parties hereto will
consult with each other concerning the means by which the employees,
customers, and suppliers of the Business and others having dealings with the
Business will be informed of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit
either Party's (or either Party's respective Affiliates') rights to disclose
the existence of this Agreement and the general nature of the transaction
described herein on any earnings call or in similar discussions with financial
media or analysts, stockholders and other members of the investment community.

  

  

Section 7.16. _Supplements to Seller Disclosure Schedules_. From time to time
prior to the Closing, Seller may supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure
Schedules to properly reflect matters arising after the date hereof (or, in
the case of matters that are based on Seller's Knowledge, matters that first
come to Seller's Knowledge after the date hereof) (i) that result from the
operation of the Business after the date hereof consistent with the
requirements of _Section 7.1_ (an " _Ordinary Course Update_ ") or (ii) that,
if existing on the date hereof would constitute a breach of any of Seller's
representations and warranties hereunder if not set forth on, or described in,
the Seller Disclosure Schedules (a " _Schedule Update_ "). In the event that
Seller provides written notice to Buyer prior to Closing of a Schedule Update
and the Closing nevertheless occurs, any breach of any representation or
warranty made by Seller which would exist absent such Schedule Update will be
deemed cured and all rights of Buyer with respect to such breach shall be
deemed waived.

  

  

 

49  

  

Section 7.17. _Collections; Remittances_. From and after the Effective Time,
(a) Seller shall promptly remit to Buyer any amounts that are collected or
received by Seller that are for the account of Buyer pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and (b) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
promptly remit to Seller any amounts that are collected or received by Buyer
or any such Affiliate that are for the account of Seller pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.18. _Post-Closing Covenants Related to Elizabethtown Gas Name_. At
the Effective Date, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested
in writing by Buyer, Seller shall make appropriate filings and to affect the
transfer of all of Seller's rights to the Assigned IP, including providing for
the transfer of the Assigned IP on the Effective Date. Prior to the Effective
Date, Buyer will establish an account with GoDaddy.com, Inc., the registrar
for the elizabethtowngas.com domain.

  

  

Section 7.19. _Replacement of Guarantees or Other Credit Support_. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any obligations to maintain any guarantee or other form of credit support
to secure performance or payment under any Purchased Business Agreements after
the Closing. Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to
Seller, prior to the Closing and to be effective upon the Closing, a full and
unconditional release of all of the obligations of Seller and its Affiliates
under each of the agreements and instruments set forth on _Schedule 7.19_ (the
" _Guarantees_ ") by providing the counterparties thereto and beneficiaries
thereof with a substitute form of security. In the event that any such
counterparty or beneficiary does not accept a substitute form of security
prior to the Closing, Buyer shall continue to use its reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver to Seller as promptly as practicable after the Closing a
full and unconditional release of all of the obligations of Seller and its
Affiliates under any of the Guarantees that remain outstanding (the "
_Continuing Guarantees_ "). Buyer acknowledges that the obligations of Seller
and its Affiliates under the Continuing Guarantees arising after the Closing
are for the account of Buyer and any Indemnifiable Losses suffered, paid or
incurred by Seller and its Affiliates in respect thereof shall be paid or
reimbursed by Buyer, as applicable, and shall otherwise be subject to
indemnification by Buyer as Assumed Obligations. Buyer agrees to deliver to
Seller at Closing and maintain in effect a letter of credit or other
reasonable form of security in respect of Buyer's indemnification obligations
relating to each Continuing Guarantee until such time as there has been a full
and unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates from all obligations
thereunder. Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to:
(i) renew or extend the term of, (ii) increase the obligations under, or (iii)
transfer to a third party any Business Agreement or other obligation covered
by a Continuing Guarantee.

  

  

Section 7.20. _Financing Covenant_.

  

  

(a) Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, at Buyer's expense and
solely as an accommodation to Buyer, in connection with the arrangement of any
financing to be consummated with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ that (i) such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller and its Affiliates and (ii)
none of Seller and its Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation under
any agreement or document related to such financing or otherwise be required
to incur any liability or obligation in connection with such financing.

  

  

 

50  

  

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for all fees and expenses related to any
financing to be consummated in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.6_
, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable, for
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by
Seller and its Affiliates in connection with such cooperation or otherwise in
connection with any such financing. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any such financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith.

reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in writing by
notice from the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party prior to the
expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not thereafter be
barred by the expiration of the relevant representation or warranty and such
claims shall survive until finally resolved.

  

  

 

52  

  

Section 9.2. _Indemnification_.

  

  

(a) Subject to _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.4_ hereof, from and after the
Closing, Seller **** will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer, its
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives (the " _Buyer
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Claims and Losses (each, an "
_Indemnifiable Loss_ ") incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee to the
extent resulting from or arising out of:

  

  

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach by Seller of any Seller Indemnified
Representation, as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as
if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Effective Date
(except for representations or warranties that expressly relate to any
specified date, the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with
reference to such specified date); and

  

  

(ii) the Excluded Liabilities and the Excluded Assets.

  

  

(b) Subject to _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.4_ hereof, from and after the
Closing, Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller, its
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives (the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses incurred or
suffered by any Seller Indemnitee to the extent resulting from or arising out
of:

  

  

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach by Buyer of any Buyer Indemnified
Representation, as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as
if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Effective Date
(except for representations or warranties that expressly relate to any
specified date, the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with
reference to such specified date); and

  

  

(ii) the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Obligations.

  

  

Section 9.3. _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

  

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Person entitled to receive indemnification
under this Agreement (an " _Indemnitee_ ") receives notice of any Claim by any
Person who is neither a Party to this Agreement nor an Affiliate of a Party to
this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for which has or could reasonably
give rise to a right of indemnification hereunder, or which the Indemnitee may
claim a right to indemnification hereunder from the other Party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnitee will promptly give written notice (a "
_Third Party Claim Notice_ ") of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying
Party. Any such Third Party Claim Notice shall (i) describe the nature, facts
and circumstances of the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, (ii) state
the estimated amount of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnitee, if practicable, (iii) state the method and
computation thereof, and (iv) contain specific reference to the provision or
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises. The Indemnitee shall provide the Indemnifying Party with
such other information known to it or in its possession with respect to the
Third Party Claim as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The
Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense, will have the right, upon
written notice to the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days (or such earlier time
as may be required by the nature of the Third Party Claim) of receiving a
Third Party Claim Notice, to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim
through counsel of its choice, _provided_ , that the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to retain its own counsel, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, if
(i) upon the advice of Indemnitee's counsel, a conflict of interest exists (or
would reasonably be expected to arise) that would make it inappropriate for
the same counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and Indemnitee in
connection with a Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to
diligently prosecute the defense of the Third Party Claim, or (iii) such Third
Party Claim (A) seeks non-monetary relief, or (B) involves criminal or quasi
criminal allegations and, _provided_ _further_ , that if the aggregate dollar
amount of the Third Party Claim, together with all other Third Party Claims of
which the Indemnifying Party is aware or has received Third Party Claim
Notices, and all costs and expenses reasonably estimated to be incurred in
connection with the defense thereof, would exceed the monetary limitation of
the indemnification obligation applicable to such Third Party Claim (the "
_Indemnification Cap_ "), the Indemnitee may, at its option, and to the extent
in excess of the Indemnification Cap at its sole cost and expense, assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice upon written
notice to the Indemnifying Party within fifteen (15) days of receiving a Third
Party Claim Notice.

  

  

 

53  

  

(b) _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ , the Indemnifying
Party will diligently pursue such defense, and will keep the Indemnitee
reasonably informed with respect to such defense. The Indemnitee shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel, including making available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnitee's possession or
under the Indemnitee's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnitee will have the right to participate in
such defense, including appointing separate counsel, but the costs of such
participation shall be borne solely by the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party
will, in consultation with the Indemnitee, make all decisions and determine
all actions to be taken with respect to the defense and settlement of the
Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
not pay, compromise, settle, or otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement
involves only the payment of money, such payment is made in full solely by the
Indemnifying Party without recourse to the Indemnitee, and such settlement
does not impose any obligations or restrictions on the Indemnitee of any
nature other than an obligation to pay monetary damages indemnified hereunder.
In no event will the Indemnifying Party have authority to agree, without the
consent of the Indemnitee, to any relief binding on the Indemnitee other than
the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party without recourse to the
Indemnitee.

  

  

(c) _Failure to Assume Defense_. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnitee in
writing of its election to defend, or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may defend such Third Party
Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Indemnifiable Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitee shall not pay, compromise, settle, or
otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  

  

 

54  

  

(d) _Direct Losses_. Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable
Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Loss_ ") will
be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof,
(i) describing the nature, facts and circumstances of such Indemnifiable Loss
in reasonable detail, (ii) stating the amount of the Indemnifiable Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee, if practicable, (iii) stating
the method and computation thereof, and (iv) containing specific reference to
the provision or provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises. The Indemnitee shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect to the Direct Loss
as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel, including permitting reasonable access to
books, records, and personnel, in connection with determining the validity of
any claim for indemnification by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving
such matters. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of thirty (30)
Business Days within which to respond to such claim of a Direct Loss. If the
Indemnifying Party rejects such claim, or does not respond within such period,
the Indemnitee may seek enforcement of its rights to indemnification under
this Agreement.

  

  

(e) _Delay_. A failure to give timely notice as provided in this _Section 9.3_
will affect the rights or obligations of a Party hereunder only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, the Party entitled to receive such notice
was actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no claim for indemnification first made after expiration of the
applicable survival period with respect to the representation, warranty or
covenant on which such claim is based set forth in _Section 9.1_ will be valid
and any such claim shall be deemed time-barred.

  

  

(f) _Tax Losses_. In the event of a conflict between _Section 7.9_ and this
_Section 9.3_ , _Section 7.9_ shall control with respect to Taxes.

  

  

Section 9.4. _Limitations on Indemnification and Related Matters_.

  

  

(a) A Party may assert a claim for indemnification hereunder only to the
extent the Indemnitee gives notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with _Section 9.3_ prior to the expiration of the Survival Period.

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no time limitation on claims
for indemnification relating to Excluded Liabilities or Assumed Obligations.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) In no event shall either Party be liable for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ hereof (A) for any item or items
arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances where the Indemnifiable
Loss relating thereto is less than $500,000 and (B) in respect of each
individual item where the Indemnifiable Loss relating thereto is equal to or
greater than $500,000, unless and until the aggregate of all such
Indemnifiable Losses which are incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees
or Seller Indemnitees, respectively, exceeds two percent (2%) of the Base
Purchase Price (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which case the Buyer
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, shall be entitled, subject
to Section 9.4(b)(ii), to indemnification only for such Indemnifiable Losses
in excess of the Threshold Amount.

  

  

 

55  

  

(ii) Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to make payments for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ or
_Section 7.9(b)_ , respectively, in an aggregate amount in excess of the Base
Purchase Price.

  

  

(iii) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be obligated under this
_Article IX_ to indemnify any Indemnitee entitled to indemnification hereunder
in respect of any Losses that result from the intentional misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
except for the representations and warranties expressly contained in _Article
V_ , neither Seller, any of its Affiliates or any Seller Representative, nor
any other Person is making any other express or implied representation or
warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever (including with respect to Seller,
the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Obligations or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and Seller hereby disclaims any
other representations or warranties, whether made by such Party or its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, or representatives,
including the implied warranty of merchantability and any implied warranty of
fitness for a particular purpose.

  

  

Section 9.5. _Mitigation_.

  

  

(a) An Indemnitee will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Indemnifiable Losses, including commercially reasonable efforts to recover all
Indemnifiable Losses from insurers of such Indemnitee under applicable
insurance policies or through the rate recovery process so as to reduce the
amount of any Indemnifiable Loss hereunder. In the event the Indemnitee shall
fail to use such commercially reasonable efforts, then notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be required to indemnify the Indemnitee for that portion of Indemnifiable
Losses that would reasonably have been expected to have been avoided if the
Indemnitee had used such commercially reasonable efforts.

  

  

(b) The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss will be reduced to the extent of any
insurance proceeds, rate recovery or other payments actually received from an
insurer or other third party with respect to an Indemnifiable Loss, net of all
costs of recovery. If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time
subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is
reduced by recovery, settlement, or payment under or pursuant to any insurance
coverage, by rate recovery or by recovery, settlement, or payment by or
against any other Person, the amount of such reduction (net of all costs of
recovery), will be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party
reasonably promptly following actual receipt or credit of such amounts.

  

  

 

56  

  

(c) The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss will be reduced to the extent of any
net Tax benefit available to the Indemnitee or its Affiliates arising in
connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Indemnifiable
Loss.

  

  

(d) Upon making any indemnity payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the
extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnitee against any third party in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to
which the indemnity payment relates.

  

  

Section 9.6. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Buyer agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article IX_ or pursuant to
_Section 7.9_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local
and foreign income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by Law.

  

  

Section 9.7. _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law,
no Party will be liable to the other Party, either in contract or in tort, for
any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages of the
other Party, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits
or income, diminution in value or loss of business reputation or opportunity,
relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof or otherwise, whether or not
the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the other Party in
advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by such other Party, and, in
particular, no "multiple of profits," "multiple of cash flow," "multiple of
assets" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the
amount of any Indemnifiable Losses. The exclusion of consequential,
incidental, indirect, special, and punitive damages as set forth in the
preceding sentence does not apply to any such damages actually paid to a third
parties by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, in connection with Losses that
may be indemnified pursuant to this _Article IX_ after Closing.

  

  

Section 9.8. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for injunctive relief and as provided
in _Section 7.2(a)_ , the Parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after
the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or inaccuracy, or
alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty in this
Agreement or any breach or failure to perform, or alleged breach or failure to
perform, any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or any other claim based
upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby, will be indemnification in accordance with this _Article
IX_ and _Section 7.9_ (which shall relate only to Claims related to Taxes). In
furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and Buyer hereby waive, on behalf of
themselves and the other Seller Indemnitees and Buyer Indemnitees,
respectively, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all
other rights, claims, and causes of action (including rights of contribution,
rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Laws,
claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent
misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty) that may be based
upon, arise out of, or relate to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Excluded Assets, the Assumed Obligations, the Excluded Liabilities, this
Agreement, the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement
(including any tort or breach of contract claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), or the transactions contemplated hereby, known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may
have against the other arising under or based upon any Law, common law, or
otherwise.

TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES

  

  

Section 10.1. _Termination_.

  

  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Date
by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.

  

  

(b) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller or Buyer if the Closing has not
occurred on or before twelve (12) months following the date of this Agreement
(the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 10.1(b)_ will not be available to a Party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of,
or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if twelve (12) months
following the date of this Agreement the conditions to the Closing set forth
in _Section 8.1(b)_ , have not been fulfilled but all other conditions to the
Closing have been fulfilled or are capable of being fulfilled at the Closing,
then the Termination Date will be the day which is fifteen (15) months
following the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) This Agreement may be terminated by either Seller or Buyer if (i) any
Required Regulatory Approval has been denied by the applicable Governmental
Entity, and all appeals of such denial have been taken and have been
unsuccessful, or (ii) one or more courts of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or any State has issued an Order preliminarily, temporarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Closing, and
such Order has become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(c)_ shall not
be available to any Party if the denial, restraining, enjoining or other
action described in (i) or (ii) hereof is the result of a failure of such
Party to comply with its obligations pursuant to _Section 7.7_ or _Section
7.8._

  

  

(d) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer by giving written notice to
Seller if there has been a breach by Seller of any representation, warranty,
or covenant made by it in this Agreement which would prevent the satisfaction
of any condition to the obligations of Buyer to effect the Closing and such
breach has not been cured by Seller or waived by Buyer within twenty (20)
Business Days after notice of any such breach; _provided_ , that Buyer shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement if Buyer is then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained herein.

  

  

(e) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller by giving written notice to
Buyer if there has been a breach by Buyer of any representation, warranty, or
covenant made by it in this Agreement which would prevent the satisfaction of
any condition to the obligations of Seller to effect the Closing and such
breach has not been cured by Buyer or waived by Seller within twenty (20)
Business Days after notice of any such breach; _provided_ , that Seller shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement if Seller is then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained herein.

  

  

Section 10.2. _Procedure; Effect of Termination; Termination Fee_.

  

  

(a) In the event that a Party having the right to terminate this Agreement
desires to terminate this Agreement, such Party shall give the other Party
written notice of such termination, specifying the basis for such termination,
and this Agreement will terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby
will be abandoned, without further action by either Party, whereupon the
liabilities of the Parties hereunder will terminate, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this _Section 10.2_.

  

  

 

58  

  

(b) The obligations of the Parties under _Article XI_ , and in _Section 5.16_
, _Section 6.5_ , _Section 7.3_ , _Section 7.6_ , and _Section 7.15_ and this
_Section 10.2_ (and any definitions in _Article I_ referenced in any of the
foregoing) will survive the termination of this Agreement. Nothing herein
shall relieve any Party from liability for any willful and material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such Party contained in
this Agreement.

  

  

(c) If (1) either Buyer or Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.1(b)_ and, at the time of such termination, any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not have been satisfied, (2) either Buyer
or Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_ (if, and
only if, the applicable denial, restraining, enjoining or other action
described in _Section 10.1(c)_ giving rise to such termination arises in
connection with any Required Regulatory Approval or in connection with the
assertion by any other Governmental Entity that its approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is required) or (3) Seller
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_ based on either (x) a
failure by Buyer to perform its covenants or agreements under _Section 7.7(a)_
or _Section 7.8_ , or (y) a failure by Buyer to close the transactions
contemplated hereby when it is otherwise obligated to do so, then, in any such
case, Buyer shall pay to Seller a fee of $80,000,000 in cash (the "
_Termination Fee_ "). Buyer shall pay the Termination Fee to Seller (to an
account designated in writing by Seller) prior to or concurrently with such
termination of this Agreement by Buyer or no later than three (3) Business
Days after the date of the applicable termination by Seller. For the avoidance
of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Seller be entitled to collect the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion and under no circumstances shall the
Seller be permitted to receive both a grant of specific performance of the
obligation to close contemplated by _Section 11.12_ and collect the
Termination Fee.

  

  

(d) Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section 10.2(c)_ are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Seller would not enter into this Agreement. If Buyer
fails to promptly pay an amount due pursuant to _Section 10.2(c)_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, Seller commences a Claim that results in an
Order against Buyer for the amount set forth in _Section 10.2(c)_ or any
portion thereof, Buyer shall pay to Seller its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of any expert or
consultant engaged by Seller) in connection with such Claim, together with
interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at the U.S. prime rate as quoted by The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. Any amount payable pursuant to _Section 10.2(c)_ or _Section 10.2(d)_
shall be paid by Buyer by wire transfer of same-day funds prior to or on the
date such payment is required to be made.

  

  

(e) Without limiting the rights of Seller under _Section 11.12_ prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , if this Agreement
is terminated under circumstances in which Buyer is obligated to pay the
Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Seller pursuant
to _Section 10.2(d)_ , upon payment of the Termination Fee and such costs and
expenses, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no further liability with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to Seller,
and payment of the Termination Fee and such costs and expenses by Buyer shall
be Seller's sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by Seller in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
Seller shall not have, and expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right,
remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at
law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity); _provided_ that,
regardless of whether Buyer pays or is obligated to pay the Termination Fee,
nothing in this _Section 10.2(e)_ shall release Buyer from liability for a
Willful Breach of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful
Breach_ " means a breach that is a consequence of a deliberate act or
deliberate failure to act undertaken by the breaching Party with the knowledge
that the taking of or failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; provided that, without limiting the
meaning of Willful Breach, the Parties acknowledge and agree that any failure
by any Party to consummate the acquisition of the Purchased Assets, the
assumption of the Assumed Obligations and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be completed at the Closing (the " _Acquisition_ ") after
the applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ have been
satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the Acquisition) shall
constitute a Willful Breach of this Agreement by such Party. For the avoidance
of doubt, (i) in the event that all applicable conditions to the Closing set
forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or waived (except for those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which
conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the time of such failure to
consummate the Acquisition) but Buyer fails to close for any reason, such
failure to close shall be considered a Willful Breach by the Buyer and (ii)
the availability or unavailability of financing for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have no effect on Buyer's obligations
hereunder.

  

  

 

59  

  

(f) Upon any termination of this Agreement, all filings, applications and
other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable,
will within a commercially reasonable time thereafter be withdrawn by the
filing Party from the Governmental Entity or other Person to which they were
made.

under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

  

  

Section 11.13. _Disclosure Generally_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement,
the information and disclosures contained in any Seller Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference with respect to
any other representation or warranty of Seller for which applicability of such

not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by
this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein
shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or
"Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.14. _" As Is" Sale; Release_.

Assumed Obligations, effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall and shall cause
its Affiliates to absolutely and unconditionally release, acquit and forever
discharge Seller and its Affiliates, each of their present and former
officers, directors, managers, employees and agents and each of their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, from any
and all costs, expenses, damages, debts, or any other obligations, liabilities
and claims whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both in law and in equity, in
each case to the extent arising out of or resulting from the ownership and/or
operation of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Obligations, or
the assets, business, operations, conduct, services, products and/or employees
(including former employees) of any of the Business (and any predecessors),
whether related to any period of time before or after the Effective Date
including, without limitation, as to liabilities under any Environmental Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , in the event Buyer is sued by Seller or its
Affiliates for any matter subject to this release, Buyer shall have the right
to raise any defenses or counterclaims in connection with such lawsuits.

the contrary contained herein, none of the Financing Sources shall have any
liability to Seller or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Seller or
its Affiliates be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement against any of the Financing Sources.
