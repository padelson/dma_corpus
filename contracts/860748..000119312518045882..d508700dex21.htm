This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 13, 2018 (as amended
in accordance with the terms hereof, this " _Agreement_ "), is by and among
Kemper Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Vulcan Sub, Inc.,
an Ohio corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have each unanimously approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company with the Company as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ "),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (the " _OGCL_ "), whereby
each issued and outstanding share (each, a " _Company Share_ " and,
collectively, the " _Company Shares_ ") of common stock of the Company, no par
value per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), other than Appraisal Shares
and any Company Shares owned by any Parent Company or any Acquired Company,
will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (subject
to any required withholding of Taxes);

 

WHEREAS, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desires to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS, (a) as an inducement to and condition of Parents and Merger Subs
willingness to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of the Persons listed on _Schedule I_ is
entering into a voting agreement with Parent, dated as of the date hereof,
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ (collectively, the "
_Company Voting Agreements_ ") and (b) as an inducement to and condition of
the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Persons listed on
_Schedule II_ is entering into a voting agreement with the Company, dated as
of the date hereof, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit B_
(collectively, the " _Parent Voting Agreements_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the OGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and specified in the OGCL. (b) At the Effective Time, the Company Charter shall be amended and restated
to read as set forth on _Exhibit C_ and shall thereafter be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof, hereof and of the other organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law. At the Effective
Time, the code of regulations of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation
(except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by
references to the name of the Surviving Corporation) until thereafter amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof, hereof and of the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such transactions, including the Merger and
the Share Issuance, the " _Transactions_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m.,
Chicago, Illinois time, on a date to be specified by the parties, such date to
be no later than the third Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all
of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ (other than conditions that
may only be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction of
such conditions), by electronic exchange of documents and signatures, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The
date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date (or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may agree), the Company and Merger Sub shall cause to
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed and acknowledged in
accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the
relevant provisions of the OGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been
duly filed with, and accepted by, the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio
or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in
the Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_."

 

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and
such other individuals as Parent may determine shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case until their respective successors shall have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Surviving Corporations articles of incorporation and
code of regulations and applicable Law.

 



2 ARTICLE II

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any Company Shares or any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub:

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) Each Company Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub, any other direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or any Acquired Company shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.01
per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c)

 

(i) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each issued and outstanding Company Share (in each case,
other than Appraisal Shares and Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the only class of capital stock of the Company then outstanding, shall
be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive the following consideration, without interest thereon and subject to
any required withholding of Taxes, and such certificated Company Share and the
certificate that formerly represented such Company Share (a " _Certificate_ ")
or such non-certificated Company Share in book-entry form (" _Company Book-
Entry Shares_ "), as the case may be, shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the following consideration, without interest thereon and
subject to any required withholding of Taxes (in each case as applicable):

(A) Each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive
a combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been effectively
made and not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ (each, a "
_Mixed Consideration Electing Share_ ") and each Non-Electing Company Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the combination (which
combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Mixed Consideration_ ")
of (1) $51.60 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ ") and (2) 1.2019 of a
share of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common
Stock (the " _Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(ii)_.

 

(B) Each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive only cash
(a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ (each, a " _Cash Electing Company Share_ ")
shall be converted ( _provided_ that the Available Cash Election Amount equals
or exceeds

 



3  the Cash Election Amount) into the right to receive in cash, without
interest, an amount (rounded to two decimal places) (the " _Per Share Cash
Election Consideration_ ") equal to the sum of (1) the Per Share Cash Amount
plus (2) the product of the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio multiplied by
the Fixed Volume-Weighted Average Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (x)
the product of the number of Cash Electing Company Shares and the Per Share
Cash Election Consideration (such product being the " _Cash Election Amount_
") exceeds (y) the difference between (I) the product of the Per Share Cash
Amount and the total number of Company Shares (other than Appraisal Shares
and Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (II)
the product of the Per Share Cash Amount and the number of Mixed
Consideration Electing Shares (including any Non-Electing Company Shares)
(such difference being the " _Available Cash Election Amount_ "), then each
Cash Electing Company Share shall be converted into a right to receive (a) an
amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product (rounded to two decimal
places) of (i) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the
denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being
the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (b) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the
Exchange Ratio and (2) one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

 

(C) Each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive only stock
consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been effectively made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ (each, a " _Stock Electing
Company Share_ ") shall be converted ( _provided_ that the Cash
Election Amount equals or exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount) into a
number of shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(ii)_, equal to (1) the Mixed Election
Stock Exchange Ratio plus (2) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of
the Per Share Cash Amount divided by the Fixed Volume-Weighted Average Price;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds
the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Electing Company Share shall be
converted into the right to receive (x) an amount of cash (without interest)
equal to the amount (rounded to two decimal places) of such excess divided by
the number of Stock Electing Company Shares and (y) a number of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded to four decimal places) of (I) the Exchange Ratio and
(II) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in _clause (x)_ of this
paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration.

 



4 (ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock or the outstanding Company Shares or the securities
convertible into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

(iii) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued and cash payable upon the
conversion of Company Shares pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ and
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ are referred to herein, collectively, as the "
_Merger Consideration_."

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, that have not
been voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and
that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal and payment of the fair cash value of such Company Shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the
OGCL (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into Merger Consideration
as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, but rather the holders of Appraisal
Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are provided by Sections
1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to such Appraisal Shares;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Sections
1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
finally determine that such holder is not entitled to the remedies provided
by Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to the Appraisal
Shares, then the rights of such holder under Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of
the OGCL with respect to such Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration Electing Shares that have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and be deemed to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(i)(A)_, without interest and subject to any
required withholding of Taxes. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and Actions with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer or commit to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.2  _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available with a nationally
recognized financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _ Article_
__ _ II_, through the Exchange Agent, the full number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.1_ in exchange for
outstanding Company Shares based on a good faith estimate thereof. Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall

 



5  cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent all of the cash necessary to pay
the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, and shall, after the Effective
Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be
provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on
such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ (such
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such
deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock. In no event shall Parent be required to issue
certificates or scrip, or make any book-entries, representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange
Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _
Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Parent Common
Stock and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ out
of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

 

(b) Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of
a Certificate whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to any Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Form of Election and any Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and matters relating
thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash and the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-
certificated book-entry form) which the aggregate number of Company Shares
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to _ Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ into the right to receive and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in _ Section_ __ _
2.2(e)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to _Section_
__ _ 2.1(d)_ and the last sentence of _ Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, until
surrendered as contemplated by this _ Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate has been
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no holder of Company Book-Entry Shares shall
be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of

 



6  transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant hereto. In lieu thereof, each
registered holder of one or more Company Book-Entry Shares shall
automatically upon the delivery of a Form of Election (and, in the case of
Company Book-Entry Shares held via a depository, upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of any customary transmission or materials required by the Exchange
Agent), be entitled to receive, the Merger Consideration. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Company Book-Entry Shares shall only be
made to the Person in whose name such Company Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any Certificate formerly representing Company Shares or Company Book-Entry
Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, until the
surrender of such Certificate or (in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares)
delivery of a Form of Election (and, in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares
held via a depository, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of any customary
transmission or materials required by the Exchange Agent), in accordance with
this _ Article_ __ _ II_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of
any such Certificate or (in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares) delivery
of a Form of Election (and, in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares held via
a depository, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of any customary transmission
or materials required by the Exchange Agent), there shall be paid to the
holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or delivery, as the case
may be, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _ Section_
__ _ 2.2(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender or delivery, as the case may be,
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms
of this _ Article_ __ _ II_ upon conversion of any Company Shares shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Shares (other than the right to receive
dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _ Section_ __ _
2.2(c)_). After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Company
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _
Article_ __ _ II_.

 

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Shares pursuant to _
Section_ __ _ 2.1_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For
purposes of this _ Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, all fractional shares to which a
single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated, and calculations
shall be rounded to

 



7  three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of
Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall
be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the
nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share
interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled under _ Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ (or would be entitled but for this _
Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) and (ii) an amount equal to the Fixed Volume-Weighted
Average Price. The amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company
Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock
shall be paid by the Exchange Agent, without interest, to the holders of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash as soon as practicable
after the determination of such amount.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this _ Article_ __ _ II_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent therefor for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration
and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by _ Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(i)_.

 

(g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent in
accordance with _ Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
Immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration or any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by _ Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)(i)_ in respect of a Company Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Company
Share shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and the cash,
unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_ had such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ that no monetary losses on
such investment thereof shall affect the Merger Consideration payable
hereunder and, following any such losses, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_, in
the amount of such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Exchange
Fund is insufficient to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that
remains payable. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent.

 



8 (j) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or under any
provision of U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority,
such amount deducted or withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made, and, in the case of any amounts withheld from any
payments not consisting entirely of cash, Parent shall be treated as though
it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, sold
such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of
such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds
to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

Section 2.3 _Company Election Procedures_.

 

(a) Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Deadline, is a record holder
of Company Shares, other than Appraisal Shares and Company Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, shall be entitled to
specify the number of such holders Company Shares with respect to which such
holder makes a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election in
accordance with the terms hereof.

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the registration statement
on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the Share
Issuance (together with any amendment or supplements thereto, the " _Form_ __
_ S-4_") a form of election (the " _Form_ __ _ of Election_") in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Form of Election shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Form of Election and
any Certificates to the Exchange Agent. The Company shall mail the Form of
Election with the proxy statement relating to the adoption and approval of
this Agreement by the Companys shareholders and the approval of the Share
Issuance by Parents stockholders (together with any amendment or supplements
thereto, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ") to all Persons who are record
holders of Company Shares as of the record date for the Company Shareholder
Meeting. The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of Company
Shares (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner
through proper instructions and documentation) to make a Cash Election, a
Stock Election or a Mixed Election. In the event that a holder fails to make
a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election with respect to any
Company Shares held or beneficially owned by such holder by the Election
Deadline, then such holder shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with
respect to those Company Shares (each such Company Share, a " _Non-Electing
Company Share_"). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
the Form of Election available to all Persons who become record holders of
Company Shares during the period between the record date for the Company
Shareholder Meeting and the Election Deadline.

 

(c) Any such holders election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., New
York City, New York time, on the date that is ten (10) Business Days preceding
the Closing Date (the " _Election Deadline_ "), a Form of Election properly
completed and signed and accompanied by (i) Certificates

 



9  representing the Company Shares represented by Certificates to which such
Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such Form of
Election from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined
in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ that such Certificates
are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such
guarantee of delivery) or (ii) in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, any
documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. After
a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election is validly made with
respect to any Company Shares, no further registration of transfers of such
Company Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company,
unless and until such Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election is
properly revoked.

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, announce any such delay
and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.

(e) Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election may be revoked with
respect to all or a portion of the Company Shares subject thereto by the
holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition,
all Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections shall automatically
be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _
VII_. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked, the Company Shares as
to which such election previously applied shall be treated as Mixed
Consideration Electing Shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(i)_
unless a contrary election is submitted by the holder within the period during
which elections are permitted to be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_.

(f) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint determination of
Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make
any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not
Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and as to when Cash Elections, Stock
Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange
Agent (or Parent and the Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange
Agent declines to make the following computation) shall also make all
computations contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, and absent manifest
error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange
Agent may, with the written agreement of Parent (subject to the consent of
the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), make any rules as are consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_
for the implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock Elections provided for
in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect these Cash
Elections and Stock Elections.

 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Stock Awards_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time: (i) each outstanding award of performance share
units with respect to Company Common Stock (" _Company Performance Share
Awards_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the

 



10  Effective Time shall vest with respect to the target number of Company
Shares subject to such Company Performance Share Award (the " _Target Share
Amount_ ") and shall be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock, which
shall not be subject to any forfeiture restrictions, subject to any required
withholding of Taxes (which may be paid with such shares of Parent Common
Stock) (provided that any such shares of Parent Common Stock held after
payment of required withholding of Taxes shall not be sold or transferred (and
shall be restricted from being sold or transferred) prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date), with the number of such shares of Parent
Common Stock determined by multiplying the Target Share Amount by the Exchange
Ratio; (ii) each outstanding award of restricted Company Shares (" _Company
Restricted Shares_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
non-employee member of the Company Board (" _Director Restricted Shares_ ")
shall immediately vest in full and be eligible to receive the Merger
Consideration; and (iii) each outstanding award of Company Restricted Shares
(other than Director Restricted Shares) that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without any
acceleration of vesting in connection with the Transactions, and in exchange
Parent shall grant, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, a
number of restricted stock units (" _Rollover RSUs_ ") determined by
multiplying the number of cancelled Company Restricted Shares by the Exchange
Ratio, with such Rollover RSUs vesting in accordance with any applicable award
or other agreement between the recipient of such Rollover RSUs and Parent
(or an Affiliate thereof).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate the Company Stock Purchase Plan and all outstanding rights
thereunder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; ___provided_ that
from and after the date hereof, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to (i) ensure that no new Payroll Deduction Period (as defined in the Company
Stock Purchase Plan) commences after the date hereof, (ii) ensure that no new
participants are permitted to participate in the Company Stock Purchase Plan
and that the existing participants thereunder may not increase their
elections with respect to the Payroll Deduction Period in effect on the date
hereof (the " _Final Payment Period_ ") and (iii) provide notice to
participants describing the treatment of the Company Stock Purchase Plan
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_. If the Effective Time occurs during
the Final Payment Period, the Final Payment Period shall terminate no later
than the day that is ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, and the Company
shall cause the exercise date applicable to the Final Payment Period to
accelerate and occur on such termination date with respect to any then-
outstanding options. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A) the
amounts allocated to each participants account under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan at the end of the Final Payment Period shall be used to purchase
whole Company Shares at the applicable price under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan for such Final Payment Period, in accordance with the terms of
the Company Stock Purchase Plan, which Company Shares shall be cancelled at
the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and (B) as promptly as
possible following the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with
_clause (A)_ above, each participant in the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall
be returned the funds, if any, that remain in such Participants account
after such a purchase.

 



11 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company (the "
_Company Board_ ") (or an appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt such
resolutions as are necessary for the treatment of the Company Performance
Share Awards, the Company Restricted Shares and any other outstanding awards
under the Company Stock Plans and rights under the Company Stock Purchase
Plan (collectively, the " _Company Stock Awards and Rights_ ") as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

14 Section 3.3 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding Company Common Stock entitled to vote
thereon (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ "), to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary
to approve this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, subject to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and filing the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio as required by the
OGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
(assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the counterparties
hereto) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except to the
extent that enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally (whether now or hereafter
in effect) and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity (the "
_Enforceability Limitations_ ").

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly and unanimously
adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (ii) determining that the terms of the Merger and the other
Transactions are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders,
(iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted to the shareholders of the
Company for adoption and (iv) recommending that the Companys shareholders
adopt this Agreement. The Company Board has taken all action so that Parent
will not be an "interested shareholder" or prohibited from entering into or
consummating a "business combination" with the Company (in each case, as such
term is used in Chapter 1704 of the OGCL) as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions in the manner contemplated
hereby. The Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock or other securities of the Company
required under applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Regulations,
Contract or otherwise to approve the Transactions, and such vote is not
necessary to consummate any Transaction other than the Merger.

 

Section 3.4 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, do not and will not
(i) conflict with or violate the Company Charter, the Company Regulations or
the comparable organizational documents of any Material Company Subsidiary,
(ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by
_clauses_ __ _ (i)_ through _(iv)_ of _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_ have been
obtained and all filings and notifications described in such clauses have been
made and any waiting periods related thereto have terminated or expired,
conflict with or violate any U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state or local law,
statute, code, directive, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, judgment, writ,

the Exchange Act and SOX, each as in effect on the date so filed. Except to
the extent that information in any Parent SEC Document has been revised or
superseded by a Parent SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof, none of
the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of Parent is subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and no Material Parent
Subsidiary is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of any non-U.S.
Governmental Entity that performs a similar function to that of the SEC or any
securities exchange or quotation system.

consolidated Subsidiaries (including any related notes thereto) that

a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be

respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
their operations, cash flows and stockholders equity for the periods

included in the Parent SEC Documents (A) comply as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable

in the notes thereto or may be permitted by the SEC under the Exchange Act)
and (C) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and
stockholders equity for the periods indicated.

 

(c) Parent maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as required
by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting for the Parent
Companies. Parent has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide

 



46  reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Parents management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX and, based on the most
recent such assessment, concluded that such controls were effective. Since
January 1, 2015, Parent has not identified any significant deficiency,
material weakness or fraud, whether or not material, that involved management
or other employees.

Chief Financial Officer of Parent have signed, and Parent has furnished to
the SEC, all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX; (ii) the statements contained
in such certifications are accurate; (iii) such certifications contain no
qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not
been modified or withdrawn; and (iv) neither Parent nor any of its officers
has received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging
the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such
certifications.

 

(e) Since January 1, 2015, (i) no Parent Company nor, to the knowledge of
Parent, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of any of the Parent Companies has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of any of the Parent
Companies or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that any of the Parent
Companies has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices and
(ii) no attorney representing any of the Parent Companies, whether or not
employed by any of the Parent Companies, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Parent
Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Parent.

 

(f) Parent has timely responded to all comment letters from the staff of the
SEC, and the SEC has not asserted that any of such responses is inadequate,
insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. There are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to any Parent SEC Documents and, to the knowledge of Parent, none of
the Parent SEC Documents (other than confidential treatment requests) is the
subject of ongoing SEC review. There are no internal investigations, or to the
knowledge of Parent, SEC inquiries or investigations or other governmental
inquiries or investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of any of the Parent Companies.

arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or

reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it
is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading or (b) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first
mailed to Parents stockholders and the Companys shareholders or at the time
of the Parent Stockholder Meeting or the Company Shareholder Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not

documents filed by Parent with the SEC in connection herewith will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of applicable
Law, including the Exchange Act, except that no representation is made by

Companies within the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and that are not part of any class action litigation, there is no
Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against any Parent
Company, any Parent Companys properties or assets or any Parent
Companys present or former officers, directors or, to the knowledge of

negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously made available by it or on its behalf in
connection with any actual or potential Company Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify in any respect
any material provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which
any Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the provisions of any such
agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to
waive any standstill provision included in any such confidentiality agreement
or any standstill provision contained in any standstill agreement to which any
Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party solely
to permit any Company Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) that
failure to waive such standstill would constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law.

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall cause
the directors and officers of the Company not to and shall direct their
respective other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly induce or facilitate the making,

negotiations with any Person with respect to any Company Acquisition

Person (other than the Companys Representatives) in connection with a Company
Acquisition Proposal. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, if
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, (i) the
Company receives, after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited _bona_ __ _
fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) such Company Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach of this Agreement and (iii) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisor) that such Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal, then, prior to obtaining the

 



61  Company Shareholder Approval, the Company may (and may authorize and permit
its Subsidiaries and Representatives to): (A) make available information with
respect to the Acquired Companies to the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a Company Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that any non-public information provided or made
available to any Person given such access shall have been previously provided
or made available to Parent or shall be provided or made available to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made
available to such Person; and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquired
Companies shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries and the Companys
directors and officers to, and direct the Companys other Representatives to,
cease any activities described in _clause_ __ _ (A)_ or _(B)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ immediately following the time that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and outside financial advisor) that the applicable Company Acquisition
Proposal ceases to be a Company Superior Proposal or a Company Acquisition
Proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may in any event
have discussions with any Person solely in order to (1) clarify and
understand the terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal made
by such Person and (2) to request that any Company Acquisition Proposal made
orally be made in writing. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any
Company Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Company Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer
and the terms and conditions thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person
prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status of, and any financial or other
changes in, any such Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer,
including providing Parent copies of any correspondence related thereto and
proposed documents to effect such Company Acquisition Proposal (or a written
summary of the material terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal, if not
made in writing).

(d) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, _Section_ __ _
5.3(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i)(A) directly or indirectly, fail to make,
withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the
Company Recommendation or the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other Transactions, take any action (or permit or authorize any of the
Acquired Companies or any of its or their respective Representatives to take
any such action) inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or resolve,
agree or propose to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(i)(A)_ being referred to herein as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or
otherwise declare advisable any Company Acquisition Proposal or resolve, agree
or propose to take any such actions, (ii) cause or permit the Company to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in

venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement related to a

Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, (iii) take any action to make
the provisions of any Takeover Laws or any restrictive provision of any
applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company Charter or the Company
Regulations inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Company
Acquisition Proposal (including approving any transaction under the OGCL)
or (iv) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

 



62 (e) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval, provided that the Acquired Companies have
complied with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ applicable to the
Acquired Companies, then, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Company Board may solely in response to a Company Superior Proposal
received on or after the date hereof that has not been withdrawn or abandoned
and that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in order to cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(iv)_ (including
payment of the Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a binding
definitive agreement to effect such Company Superior Proposal. Neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(d)(iv)_ or cause the Company to enter into a binding definitive agreement
to effect such Company Superior Proposal unless the Company has first complied
with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ and, after so complying, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel) that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal.

 

(f) The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_ unless the Company has first (i) provided written notice to Parent (a
" _Notice of Company Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company
has received a Company Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions
of such Company Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Company
Superior Proposal and providing copies of any agreements intended to effect
such Company Superior Proposal and that the Company Board has made the
determination required under  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, (ii) negotiated, and
caused the Company and its Representatives to negotiate, during the four (4)
Business Day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of Company
Superior Proposal (the " _Company_ _Superior Proposal_ ___Notice Period_ "),
in good faith with Parent to enable Parent to make a counteroffer or propose
to amend the terms of this Agreement (to the extent Parent wishes to do so)
so that such Company Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal, and (iii) after complying with the immediately foregoing
_clauses_ __ _ (i)_ and _(ii)_ , reaffirmed the Company Boards
determination required under _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ in light of any
counteroffer or proposed amendment to the terms of this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that if, during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period any
revisions are made to a Company Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are
material (it being understood and agreed that any change to consideration with
respect to such proposal is material), the Company shall deliver a new Notice
of Company Superior Proposal to Parent and shall comply with the requirements
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ with respect to such new Notice of Company
Superior Proposal, except that any subsequent Company Superior
Proposal Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days following Parents
receipt of such new Notice of Company Superior Proposal.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board,
in circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
from effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the
occurrence of a Company 

 



63  Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) that the failure to do
so would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of
the Company under applicable Law and the Company has first: (i) provided
written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Company Intervening Event_ ")
describing the Company Intervening Event and advising Parent that the Company
Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in
reasonable detail; (ii) negotiated, and caused the Company and its
Representatives to negotiate, during the four (4) Business Days following
Parents receipt of the Notice of Company Intervening Event (the " _Company
Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), in good faith with Parent regarding any
revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by Parent in response to
such Company Intervening Event; and (iii) at the end of the Company
Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel (and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent), that a Company Intervening Event continues to exist and that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would constitute a
breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of
the Company under applicable Law.

(h) The Company agrees that it shall take all actions necessary so that any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this
Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board or any committee thereof
in any respect that would have the effect of causing any of the Takeover Laws
of any state (including the State of Ohio) or other similar statutes to be
applicable to the Transactions, including the Merger.

 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (A) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (B) making any
disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would constitute
a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that
the shareholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any
tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any
Company Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith,
the Company Board effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation
and rejects any Company Acquisition Proposal within the later of (1) three
(3) Business Days after such "stop, look and listen" communication and (2) if
applicable, the deadline for filing a Schedule 14D-9 with respect to such
Company Acquisition Proposal with the SEC.

(j) Any action taken or not taken by any Representative of any of the
Acquired Companies that, if taken or not taken by the Company would constitute
a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, shall be deemed a breach of this
Agreement by the Company.

the consummation of any of the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
in no event shall the following constitute a Company Intervening Event: (A)
the receipt, existence or terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry or matter relating thereto or consequence thereof; (B) events or
circumstances arising from the announcement or the existence of, or any action
taken by either party pursuant to and in compliance with the terms of, this
Agreement or any other agreements or other documents delivered in connection
herewith; and (C) changes in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock (it being understood that the
facts and occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such changes may be
taken into account in determining whether there has been a Company
Intervening Event).

(iv) " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any binding, _bona_ __ _ fide_
written offer made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third
party or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent
(50%) of the outstanding Company Shares or substantially all of the assets of
the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, (A) on terms which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be
superior to the shareholders of the Company to the Transactions, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including the Termination Fee, any changes proposed by Parent to the terms
of this Agreement and the potential time delays and other risks to
consummation associated with such offer), and (B) that is reasonably likely to
be completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such offer.

Section 5.4 _Parent Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Following the execution of this Agreement, the Parent Companies shall, and
Parent shall cause the directors and officers of Parent to and shall direct
their respective other Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal and (ii)
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously made available by it or on its behalf in connection with any actual
or potential Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall not terminate, waive,
amend, release or modify in any respect any material provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which any Parent Company or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any Parent 

 



66  Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall be entitled to waive any standstill provision included in
any such confidentiality agreement or any standstill provision contained in
any standstill agreement to which any Parent Company or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is a party solely to permit any Parent Acquisition
Proposal if the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
Parents outside legal counsel) that failure to waive such standstill would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent
under applicable Law.

(b) The Parent Companies shall not, and Parent shall cause the directors and
officers of Parent not to and shall direct their respective other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly induce or facilitate the making, submission
or announcement of any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
constituting or related to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) make available
any non-public information regarding any of the Parent Companies to any Person
(other than the Company and Parents or the Companys Representatives acting
in their capacity as such) in connection with or in response to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than to state
that they currently are not permitted to have discussions), (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (v) make or authorize
any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, (vi) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in
principle or any Contract providing for, relating to or in connection with any
Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than a Parent Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_) or (vii) reimburse or
agree to reimburse the expenses of any other Person (other than Parents
Representatives) in connection with a Parent Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, if
at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, (i) Parent
receives, after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited _bona_ __ _ fide_
written Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) such Parent Acquisition Proposal did
not result from a breach of this Agreement and (iii) Parent Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with Parents outside legal counsel and
outside financial advisor) that such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, then,
prior to obtaining Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent may (and may authorize
and permit its Subsidiaries and Representatives to): (A) make available
information with respect to the Parent Companies to the Person making such
Parent Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a Parent Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that any non-public information provided or made
available to any Person given such access shall have been previously provided
or made available to the Company or shall be provided or made available to the
Company prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Person; and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal regarding
such Parent Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent
Companies shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries and Parents directors
and officers to, and direct Parents other Representatives to, cease any
activities described in _clause_ __ _ (A)_ or _(B)_ of this _Section_ __ _
5.4(c)_ immediately following the time that the Parent Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with Parents outside legal counsel and outside
financial advisor) that the applicable Parent Acquisition Proposal ceases to
be a Parent Superior Proposal or a

 



67  Parent Acquisition Proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Parent and its Representatives may in any event have
discussions with any Person solely in order to (1) clarify and understand the
terms and conditions of the Parent Acquisition Proposal made by such Person
and (2) to request that any Parent Acquisition Proposal made orally be made
in writing. Parent shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) advise the Company in writing of the receipt of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such
Parent Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer and the terms and
conditions thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall keep the Company informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of the status of, and any financial or other changes in, any
such Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, including
providing Parent copies of any correspondence related thereto and proposed
documents to effect such Parent Acquisition Proposal (or a written summary of
the material terms of such Parent Acquisition Proposal, if not made in
writing).

(d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_, _Section_ __ _
5.4(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_, neither the Parent Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) directly or indirectly, fail to make, withhold,
withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the Parent
Recommendation or the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, take any action (or permit or authorize any of the Parent
Companies or any of its or their respective Representatives to take any such
action) inconsistent with the Parent Recommendation or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)(i)(A)_ being referred to herein as a " _Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or
otherwise declare advisable any Parent Acquisition Proposal or resolve, agree
or propose to take any such actions, (ii) cause or permit Parent to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement related to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, other than a Parent Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_, (iii) take any action to make the
provisions of any Takeover Laws or any restrictive provision of any applicable
anti-takeover provision in the Parent Charter or the Parent Bylaws
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Parent Acquisition Proposal
(including approving any transaction under the Delaware General Corporation
Law) or (iv) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

(e) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_, at any time prior to obtaining
Parent Stockholder Approval, provided that the Parent Companies have complied
with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ applicable to the Parent
Companies, then, prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, the
Parent Board may solely in response to a Parent Superior Proposal received on
or after the date hereof that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did
not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in order to cause Parent to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(iv)_ (including payment of the Termination
Fee) and concurrently enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such
Parent Superior Proposal. Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof
shall make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(iv)_ or cause Parent to enter
into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Parent Superior Proposal
unless Parent has first complied with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _
5.4(f)_ and, after so complying, the Parent Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with Parents outside legal counsel) that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal.

 



68 (f) Parent Board shall not take any action set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.4(e)_ unless Parent has first (i) provided written notice to the Company (a
" _Notice of Parent Superior Proposal_ ") advising the Company that Parent has
received a Parent Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions
of such Parent Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Parent
Superior Proposal and providing copies of any agreements intended to effect
such Parent Superior Proposal and that the Parent Board has made the
determination required under  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_, (ii) negotiated, and
caused Parent and its Representatives to negotiate, during the four (4)
Business Day period following the Companys receipt of the Notice of Parent
Superior Proposal (the " _Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), in good
faith with the Company to enable the Company to make a counteroffer or propose
to amend the terms of this Agreement (to the extent the Company wishes to do
so) so that such Parent Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Parent
Superior Proposal, and (iii) after complying with the immediately foregoing
_clauses_ __ _ (i)_ and _(ii)_ , reaffirmed the Parent Boards
determination required under _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_ in light of any
counteroffer or proposed amendment to the terms of this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that if, during the Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period any
revisions are made to a Parent Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are
material (it being understood and agreed that any change to consideration with
respect to such proposal is material), Parent shall deliver a new Notice of
Parent Superior Proposal to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)_ with respect to such new Notice of Parent
Superior Proposal, except that any subsequent Parent Superior Proposal Notice
Period shall be two (2) Business Days following the Companys receipt of such
new Notice of Parent Superior Proposal.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Parent Board, in
circumstances not involving or relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, from
effecting a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the occurrence
of a Parent Intervening Event if the Parent Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with Parents outside legal counsel) that the failure to
do so would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
Parent under applicable Law and Parent has first: (i) provided written notice
to the Company (a " _Notice of Parent Intervening Event_ ") describing the
Parent Intervening Event and advising the Company that the Parent Board
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable
detail; (ii) negotiated, and caused Parent and its Representatives to
negotiate, during the four (4) Business Days following the Companys receipt
of the Notice of Parent Intervening Event (the " _Parent_ _Intervening Event
Notice Period_ "), in good faith with the Company regarding any revisions to
the terms of the Transactions proposed by the Company in response to such
Parent Intervening Event; and (iii) at the end of the Parent Intervening
Event Notice Period, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with Parents outside legal counsel (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
Company), that a Parent Intervening Event continues to exist and that the
failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would constitute a
breach by the Parent Board of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of Parent under applicable Law.

 



69 (h) Parent agrees that it shall take all actions necessary so that any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement
or any other approval of the Parent Board or any committee thereof in any
respect that would have the effect of causing any of the Takeover Laws of any
state (including the State of Ohio) or other similar statutes to be
applicable to the Transactions, including the Merger.

(i) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or elsewhere in the
Agreement shall prohibit the Parent Board from (A) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (B) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Parent Board determines
(after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Parent
Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that the
stockholders of Parent tender any securities in connection with any tender or
exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Parent
Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith, the
Parent Board effects a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ that any such disclosure
(other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be
deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Parent
Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Parent Recommendation and rejects any
Parent Acquisition Proposal within the later of (1) three (3) Business Days
after such "stop, look and listen" communication and (2) if applicable,
the deadline for filing a Schedule 14D-9 with respect to such Parent
Acquisition Proposal with the SEC.

 

(j) Any action taken or not taken by any Representative of any of the Parent
Companies that, if taken or not taken by Parent would constitute a breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by
Parent.

(k) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
respective meanings assigned below:

(i) " _Parent Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and
(taken as a whole) no less favorable to Parent than, those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_  that such confidentiality agreement

making or amendment of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, except that such
provisions may include an exception solely to allow the other party to the
agreement to (1) make a confidential Parent Acquisition Proposal to the Parent
Board or (2) make confidential requests to Parent for amendments, waivers or

the Parent Companies representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the

a whole, (C) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to

which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence or the consequences
or magnitude of the consequences thereof becomes known to or by the Parent
Board prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if the Parent Intervening Event relates to an event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, then such event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence
shall not constitute a Parent Intervening Event unless (x) it has a Company
Material Adverse Effect or (y) other than with respect to any of the consents,
qualifications, approvals, clearances, orders, waivers or exemptions
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, it materially impairs the ability of
the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or unreasonably
delay the consummation of any of the Transactions; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in no event shall the following constitute a Parent Intervening Event:
(A) the receipt, existence or terms of a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any

circumstances arising from the announcement or the existence of, or any
action taken by either party pursuant to and in compliance with the terms of,

outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be superior to the stockholders of Parent to the

proposal and this Agreement (including the Termination Fee, any changes
proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement and the potential time
delays and other risks to consummation associated with such offer), (B) that
is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,

Section 5.5 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement;
Shareholder and Stockholder Meetings_ _._

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the Form S-4,
in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of the
Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall provide the
other with the opportunity to review and comment on such documents prior to
their filing with the SEC. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to
keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the
others prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other the opportunity to
review and comment thereon. Parent or the Company, as applicable, will advise
the other promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when
the Form S-4 has become effective under the Securities Act or any supplement
or amendment has been filed with the SEC, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or any
oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide the other
with copies of any written communication received from the SEC or any state
securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement so that any such document would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party hereto that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other and an appropriate amendment or
supplement to

 



72  the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC, after the other has had a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the
shareholders of the Company. Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Parents stockholders and the Company will cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders, in each case as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event
later than thirty (30) days) following effectiveness of the Form S-4, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Company
Shareholder Approval. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, _Section_ __ _
5.3(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_, the Company shall, through the Company
Board, recommend that its shareholders adopt and approve this Agreement and
the Transactions, including the Merger (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit from its
shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Shareholder
Approval, and the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, the
Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent. The Company shall have
the right to postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting for no longer
than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate (A) for the absence of a
quorum, (B) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies
to the extent that at such time, taking into account the amount of time until
the Company Shareholder Meeting, the Company has not received a number of
proxies that would reasonably be believed to be insufficient to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholder Meeting or (C) with
the prior written consent of Parent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Companys obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_
shall not be affected by (and the Company shall seek the Company Shareholder
Approval at the Company Shareholder Meeting notwithstanding the occurrence
of) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or public or private
communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or by a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (in the event of such a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, except with respect to the Company
Recommendation) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(iv)_.

 

(c) Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event later
than thirty (30) days) following effectiveness of the Form S-4, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent
Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Parent
Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_, _Section_ __ _
5.4(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_, Parent shall, through the Parent Board,
recommend that its stockholders approve the Share Issuance (the " _Parent
Recommendation_ ") and shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Share Issuance
and (ii) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Parent
Stockholder Approval, and the Parent Board shall not withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify, the Parent Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent. Parent
shall have the right to postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting for
no longer than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate (A) for the absence
of a quorum, (B) to allow reasonable additional time to 

 



73  solicit additional proxies to the extent that at such time, taking into
account the amount of time until the Parent Stockholder Meeting, Parent has
not received a number of proxies that would reasonably be believed to be
insufficient to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval at the Parent
Stockholder Meeting or (C) with the prior written consent of the Company.

 

(d) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to hold the
Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting on the same
date, including by postponing or adjourning the Company Shareholder Meeting or
the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, if the other party postpones or
adjourns the Parent Stockholder Meeting or the Company Shareholder Meeting,
as applicable.

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to contractual
and legal restrictions applicable to the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other and to the
Representatives of such other reasonable access during normal business hours
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or the
date of the termination of this Agreement, as the case may be, to all of their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records (including the work papers of independent accountants, if available
and subject to the consent of such independent accountants) and, during such
period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other and to the
Representatives of such other all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the ordinary
course operations of the Acquired Companies or the Parent Companies, as
applicable. No access, materials, information or investigation pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto. This _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall not require any Acquired
Company or Parent Company to permit any access, or to disclose any materials
or information, that in the reasonable judgment of such party would reasonably
be expected to (i) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or a violation of any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality under any Contract, Law or otherwise (provided that party
shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such access or disclosure), (ii) result in the loss of the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege
with respect to such materials or information or (iii) in the case of
documents or portions of documents relating to pricing or other matters that
are highly sensitive, result in a violation of applicable Law (including a
Governmental Entity alleging that providing such information violates any
Regulatory Law). If any material is withheld by a party pursuant to the
preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other as to the
general nature of what is being withheld and use commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. All materials and
information exchanged or to which access is granted pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 5.6_ shall be subject to the letter agreement, dated as of October 16,
2017 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), by and between the Company and
Parent.

 



74 Section 5.7 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including: (i) obtaining all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and
approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary registrations,
filings and notifications and taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval, clearance, non-action letter, waiver or exemption from
any Governmental Entity (including under the HSR Act and the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals); (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, qualifications,
approvals, waivers or exemptions from non-governmental third parties; (iii)
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed,
but excluding any lawsuits or other legal proceedings brought by or against
any Insurance Regulator; and (iv) executing and delivering any additional
documents or instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to carry
out this Agreement (it being acknowledged and agreed that no Parent Company
shall be obligated to, and no Acquired Company shall, without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall be in the sole discretion of
Parent), in connection with the actions contemplated by the foregoing _clauses
(ii)_ and _(iv)_ , agree to any modification to or accommodation under any
Contract or pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for
or relating to any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
Transactions). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
party hereto agrees to make, if required, appropriate filings and
registrations under applicable Regulatory Laws and Insurance Laws. Each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within a
reasonable time period not to exceed fifteen (15) days after the date hereof
and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other commercially
reasonable actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period
provided for in the HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to make appropriate
filings of Applications for Approval of Acquisition of Control Statements, or
"Form A" statements, and all related filings, with respect to the Transactions
with the applicable Insurance Regulators, as applicable, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be reasonably requested by any Insurance Regulator pursuant to the
Insurance Laws and to take all other commercially reasonable actions
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the applicable consents and
approvals of the applicable Insurance Regulators as soon as practicable.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with and without limiting the obligations to
use certain efforts referenced in _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_, to the extent
relating to the requisite approvals, authorizations and clearances for the
Transactions under the HSR Act and the other Regulatory Laws and the Insurance
Laws, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in 

 



75  connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any Action initiated by a private
party, (ii) keep the other reasonably informed of any communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ "), any Insurance Regulator or any other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any Action by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) permit the other
a reasonable opportunity to review any substantive written communication
given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any scheduled
substantive meeting, discussion or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ, any
Insurance Regulator or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with
any Action by a private party, with any other Person, and, to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, such Insurance Regulator or such other
applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, as applicable, give the other
the reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings,
discussions and conferences and (iv) to the extent practicable and subject to
the other provisions in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, attempt to confer in good
faith in order to (A) exchange and review respective views and positions with
the other as to potential Materially Burdensome Conditions and (B) discuss and
present to, and engage with, the applicable Governmental Entity regarding any
approaches or actions that could mitigate the scope or impact of a potential
Materially Burdensome Condition so that it does not become a Materially
Burdensome Condition. Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other
upon receiving any communication, including promptly furnishing each other
copies of any written or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise
each other when any such communication causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite approval, authorization or
clearance for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval,
authorization or clearance or Requisite Regulatory Approval will
be materially delayed or conditioned or impose or require a Materially
Burdensome Condition. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be made
or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto, including reasonable access
to any materials submitted in connection with any proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any other applicable Regulatory Law, including any
proceeding under 16 C.F.R. § 803.20. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Parent
shall have final approval over all matters pertaining to any Action, meeting,
discussion, conference or response in connection with the HSR Act and any
Requisite Regulatory Approval and (B) the Company and Parent may, as each
deems advisable and necessary (after consultation with the Companys or
Parents outside legal counsel, as applicable), reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other side under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_ as Competitively Sensitive Information (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as supplemented by
the letter agreement, dated as of January 29, 2018 (the " _Clean Team
Addendum_ "), by and between the Company and Parent)). Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the Clean Team Member (as
defined in the Clean Team Addendum) and the outside counsel for matters
relating to Regulatory Law of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
Clean Team Member or outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or
consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates, unless expressly
provided for in and in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as supplemented by
the

 



76  Clean Team Addendum)) or express permission is obtained in advance from the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, or its outside legal counsel. Each of
the Company and Parent shall cause the Clean Team Member and its respective
outside legal counsel for matters relating to Regulatory Law to comply with
this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_.

 

(c) Without limiting any other obligations of Parent hereunder, Parent will
use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and seek to resolve as promptly
as reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions and use reasonable best efforts to take any
and all action necessary to ensure that each requisite approval, authorization
or clearance under the HSR Act and each Requisite Regulatory Approval is
obtained by the Outside Date, in each case, without imposing or requiring a
Materially Burdensome Condition.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Parent
Company shall be obligated to, and no Acquired Company shall, without the
prior written consent of Parent, consent to, take or refrain from taking, or
offer or commit or consent to take or refrain from taking (i) any action that
involves (A) making any divestiture or disposition of any portion of
any business or assets, (B) licensing any portion of any business or assets,
(C) accepting or entering any consent decree or hold separate order or (D)
placing any assets in trust, in each case by Parent or any of the other
Parent Companies or the Company or any of the other Acquired Companies or any
of their respective Affiliates, in each case except for such actions related
to _de minimis_ assets (with such assets measured on a scale relative to the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole), (ii) any action that involves (A)
accepting or entering into any operational restriction or restriction on the
payment or declaration of dividends, (B) making any capital commitment or
capital guaranty or (C) entering into any capital support agreement,
statement of support, guarantee, keep well or other similar capital
maintenance undertaking to maintain a minimum risk-based capital level or
rating, in each case with respect to, or in connection with, Parent or the
other Parent Companies or the Company or the other Acquired Companies or any
of their respective Affiliates which, in each case and together with any other
such action, would or would reasonably be expected to detract from the
benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Parent and the other Parent
Companies as a result of the Merger (with such benefits measured on a scale
relative to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole and to include Parents
ability to operate its business after giving effect to the Merger), or (iii)
any action that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, after giving effect to the
Merger (with such materiality measured on a scale relative to the Acquired
Companies, taken as a whole), in each case of the immediately foregoing
_clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , whether before or after the Closing (any
such action, a " _Materially Burdensome Condition_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
in no event shall a party hereto or any of its Affiliates be required by a
Governmental Entity to agree to take, or enter into any action, which action
is not conditioned upon the Closing.

 

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee of any of the
Acquired Companies immediately prior to the

 



77  Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") to be provided full credit for
prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries as was credited under
similar or comparable Company Plans for purposes of (i) eligibility and
vesting under any Parent Employee Plans, but not for benefit accrual purposes
under any defined benefit plan of any of the Parent Companies or for purposes
of determining eligibility for retiree health and welfare benefits, and (ii)
unless covered under another arrangement with or of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, determination of benefit levels under any Parent Employee Plan or
policy of general application relating to vacation or severance, in either
case for which the Continuing Employees are otherwise prospectively eligible
and in which the Continuing Employees are offered participation, but except
where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. For
the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be retroactively
eligible for any Parent Employee Plan, including any such Parent Employee Plan
that was frozen prior to the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall: (A)
waive, or shall use commercially reasonably efforts to cause to be waived,
any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions, actively-at-
work requirements, waiting periods and similar exclusions, to the same extent
such limitations, exclusions and requirements would not have been applicable
to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the terms
of any comparable medical and dental plan of the Acquired Companies; and (B)
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the similar or comparable Company Plans to be taken into
account for purposes of satisfying all deductibles, co-payments, maximum out-
of-pocket requirements and similar expenses applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable similar or
comparable Parent Employee Plan during the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Parent Employee Plan_
" means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA), "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),
and any other formal written plan or policy under which service with
Parent is relevant to eligibility, vesting or level of benefits, for the
benefit of, or relating to, the current employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries and with respect to which eligibility has not been frozen.

 

(b) To the extent requested by Parent in a written notice to the Company
provided at least five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to
terminate, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, any Company Plan that provides for cash or deferred elections, within
the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code. If Parent provides such a notice
to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing
Date, evidence that the Company Board has validly adopted resolutions to
terminate such Company Plans (the form and substance of which resolutions
shall be subject to the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effective no later than the
date immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans, to
permit the rollover of plan benefits into, or participation in, a Parent
benefit plan or to continue the employment of any specific individual. With
respect to any individual whose employment is terminated by Parent or the
Surviving

 



78  Corporation during the twelve (12) month period immediately following the
Effective Time (but not including any individual who has entered into an
individualized agreement providing for severance benefits upon a qualifying
termination of employment), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide
severance benefits to such individual which shall be determined and payable in
accordance with the severance benefit plan maintained for similarly situated
employees of the Company at the Effective Time, taking into account all
service with the Company in determining the amount of severance benefits
payable. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation
and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees
prior to or following the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
from amending or terminating any Company Plan following the Effective Time or
(iii) confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt
any current or former employees, labor unions, directors or independent
contractors of any of the Acquired Companies or, on or after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement.

 

(d) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or the date of the
termination of this Agreement, as the case may be, subject to  _Section_ __ _
5.1_, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the other Acquired Companies
to, use its best efforts to (i) keep effective the employment with the Company
or any of the other Acquired Companies of, and retain as employees, each of
the Key Managers and Key Employees and (ii) replace any Key Manager or Key
Employee whose employment with the Company or any of the other Acquired
Companies has been terminated, which replacement shall not occur
unless Parent has provided its prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify Parent
of the termination of the employment of any Key Manager or Key Employee with
an Acquired Company or of any Key Manager or Key Employee otherwise ceasing to
be employed by an Acquired Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Excluded Departure).

 

Section 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of the receipt of any written communication
received from any Person alleging that it or any other Person is or may be
required to obtain a material consent of such first-mentioned Person in
connection with the Transactions or a consent from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall not (a) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with,
any other provision of this Agreement or (b) limit the remedies available
to the party sending or receiving such notice.

Section 5.10 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to
or otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of any of the Acquired Companies as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational
documents and any indemnification or

 



79  other agreements of the Acquired Companies with any of the current or former
directors or officers of any of the Acquired Companies as in effect on the
date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For a period of no less than six (6) years from the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation
shall, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of each Acquired Companys certificate of incorporation
and bylaws or other comparable organizational documents in effect as of the
date of this Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the Acquired
Companies with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective
Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of any of the
Acquired Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending
or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Action.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under the Law of the State of Ohio, indemnify and hold harmless (and
advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing and costs of defense to)
each current and former director or officer of any of the Acquired Companies
(each such individual, together with such individuals heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ") in connection with any actual or
threatened Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with the fact that such
Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or fiduciary of any of the
Acquired Companies at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by applicable Law, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
for such expenses. No Indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action for
which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder
unless Parent consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) Parent shall, in its sole discretion, either (i) provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, following the Effective Time, the
Companys current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy or (ii) obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time so long as it does
not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail") directors and
officers insurance and indemnification policies that, in either case, provide
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate
period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing D andO Insurance_") that are no less favorable in the aggregate
(with respect to limits and deductibles) to the Companys existing policy or,
if such insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available similar
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation

 



80  shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the Continuing DandO
Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company s Current
Premium_"). If such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed three
hundred percent (300%) of the Companys Current Premium, then Parent shall
cause to be maintained policies of such insurance which, in Parents good
faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to three hundred percent (300%) of the Companys Current
Premium.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets, then, and in each case, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall ensure that such surviving corporation or entity or the
transferees of such properties or assets assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other comparable organizational
documents of any of the Acquired Companies or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Party with any of the Acquired Companies, in each case in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, or under applicable Law. Except as
otherwise set forth herein, these rights shall survive consummation of the
Merger in accordance with their terms and are intended to benefit, and shall
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

Section 5.11 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. Parent and the Company shall provide to the other, prior to adoption,
copies of the resolutions to be adopted by their respective boards of
directors to implement the foregoing.

Section 5.12 _Takeover Statutes_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
and their respective boards of directors (or other comparable governing
bodies) shall (a) grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate so that no Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger and the other Transactions)
and (b) if any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to this Agreement
(including the Merger and the other Transactions), grant all such approvals
and take all such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate so that
such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on
the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act reasonably to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Takeover Law on such transactions.

Section 5.13 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 



81 Section 5.14 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Action commenced after the date of this
Agreement against any Acquired Company or any of its directors or officers by
any shareholder of the Company arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
Action. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but
not control, the defense or settlement of any such Action, shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to any material developments regarding the
defense or settlement of any such Action and shall give due consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such shareholder Action and shall not settle
or offer to settle any such Action without the prior written consent of
Parent, unless (a) such settlement is solely for monetary damages entirely
paid for with proceeds of insurance (other than the deductibles under
insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof) and in connection
therewith the Company does not (i) disparage Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of the respective affiliates or businesses of
the foregoing or the impact or effect of the Transactions or (ii) disclose
competitively sensitive information of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of the respective affiliates or businesses of the
foregoing and (b) if Parent is a named party in such Action, Parent receives a
full and complete release on terms no less favorable than those received by
the Company.

Section 5.15 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall be
in a form agreed to by Parent and the Company and thereafter Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other and obtain the others prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement (including scheduling of a press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts) with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions,
except (a) as may be required by applicable Law, court process or listing

Agreement, in each case under this _clause (b)_ to the extent the disclosure
contained therein remains current and accurate, (c) in connection with any
Company Acquisition Proposal or any Parent Acquisition Proposal made in
accordance with this Agreement and (d) in connection with any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change made
in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 5.16 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided for in _Section_ __ _
2.2_, all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording
and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any
such Taxes) imposed on the Company or the Surviving Corporation or incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by either

their respective personnel and Representatives, to Parent such

required to be provided by the Company is limited to information about the
Acquired Companies and their business, operations and, in respect of the
cooperation to be provided pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.19(a)(vii)_,
financial projections and prospects and (2) except as otherwise expressly set
forth herein, no Acquired Company shall be required to prepare any information

including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and

parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement.
If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption

authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 8.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits
hereto), the Company Voting Agreements, the Parent Voting Agreements, the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement (although any provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement conflicting with this Agreement shall be superseded by the
provisions of this Agreement) constitute the entire agreement with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior written
agreements, arrangements, communications and understandings and all prior and
contemporaneous oral agreements, arrangements, communications and
understandings among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended as
necessary so that, until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ hereof, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall be
permitted to take the actions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



105 Section 8.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for (a) the provisions of _Article_ __ _ II_ (which, from
and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the holders of
Company Shares, Company Performance Share Awards and Company Restricted Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (b) _ Section_ __ _ 5.10_
(which shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs).

 

Section 8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by the internal Laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely
within such state, without regard to the conflicts of law principles of such
state that would cause the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the matters contained in  _Article_ __ _
I_ and _Article_ __ _ II_, including the matters relating to the filing of
the Certificate of Merger and the effects of the Merger, shall be governed by
the OGCL and (b) all matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board shall be governed by the internal Laws of the State of Ohio, without
regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state that would cause the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

 

Section 8.8 _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_. Each of the parties irrevocably
agrees that any Action with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
Judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
The parties further agree that no party hereto shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.8_,
and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits
with regard to any such Action for itself and in respect of its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Action with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
8.8_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (A) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby consents to service being made through
the notice procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and agrees
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
(return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid) to the respective
addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be effective service of
process for any Action in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



106 Section 8.9 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, as a whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any
party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
provided, however, that Merger Sub may assign in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger
Sub of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 8.10 _Remedies_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_, the parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or breach. Accordingly
and subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_, each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity and no party will allege,
and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an
adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties hereto hereby further waives any
requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

Section 8.11 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision had never been contained herein, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible
in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



107 Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITH AND UPON THE ADVICE OF
COMPETENT COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

 

Section 8.14 _Counterparts; Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties
hereto. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be
sufficient to bind the parties hereto to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 

Section 8.15 _Disclosure Letters_. The Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, except and to the extent expressly provided in this
Agreement. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission that such item is
material or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.
Descriptive headings in the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter are inserted for reference purposes and for convenience of
the reader only and shall not affect the interpretation thereof or of this
Agreement. Nothing contained in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission of liability or
responsibility in connection with any pending, threatened or future matter or
proceeding.
