(i) The Peoples Articles, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until amended in accordance with the OGCL;



(ii) The Peoples Regulations, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the regulations of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with the OGCL; and



(iii) Subject to Section 6.21, each individual serving as a director of
Peoples immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain a director of the
Surviving Corporation for the balance of the term for which such individual
was elected and shall serve as such until his or her successor is duly elected
and qualified in the manner provided for in the Peoples Articles and the
Peoples Regulations or as otherwise provided by the OGCL or until his or her
earlier death, resignation or removal in the manner provided in the Peoples
Articles or the Peoples Regulations or as otherwise provided by the OGCL.



(b) Option to Change Method of Merger. Peoples may at any time prior to the
Effective Time change the method of effecting the Parent Merger and/or the
Subsidiary Merger (including, without limitation, changing the provisions of
this Article II), if and to the extent Peoples deems such change to be
necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided, however, that no such change
shall:



(i) Alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to which the holders
of NBandT Financial Common Shares are entitled in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement;



(ii) Materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;



(iii) Cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Code Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code; or



(iv) Otherwise adversely affect the holders of NBandT Financial Common Shares.



NBandT Financial, if requested by Peoples, shall enter into one or more
amendments to this Agreement in order to effect any such change.

Effective Time), NBTC shall merge with and into Peoples Bank (the "Subsidiary
Merger") pursuant to an agreement to merge (the "Agreement to Merge") to be
executed by NBTC and Peoples Bank and filed with the OCC. Upon the
consummation of the Subsidiary Merger, the separate corporate existence of
NBTC shall cease and Peoples Bank shall survive the Subsidiary Merger and
continue to exist as a national bank (Peoples Bank, as the resulting bank in
the Subsidiary Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "Resulting
Bank") and the separate corporate existence of NBTC shall cease.

2.03 Effectiveness of Parent Merger. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement, the Parent Merger
shall become effective upon the later to occur of the following: (a) the
filing of the certificate of merger with the OSS; or (b) such later date and
time as may be set forth in such certificate of merger. The Parent Merger
shall have the effects prescribed in the OGCL.

2.04 Effective Date and Effective Time. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement, Peoples and NBandT
Financial shall cause the effective date of the Parent Merger (the "Effective
Date") to occur as soon as practicable after the last of the conditions set
forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Effective Date shall
not fall after the date specified in Section 8.01(c) or after the date or
dates on which any Regulatory Authority approval or any extension thereof
expires. The time on the Effective Date when the Parent Merger shall become
effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time".



ARTICLE III

Merger Consideration

3.01 Merger Consideration

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof:

(a) Conversion of NBandT Financial Common Shares. Subject to Sections 3.03,
3.04 and 3.05(b), and except as otherwise provided by paragraph (b) of this
Section 3.01, each NBandT Financial Common Share (other than Treasury Shares and
Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive, as follows, without
interest:

(i) a number of Peoples Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Per
Share Stock Consideration"); and

(ii) an amount of cash equal to $7.75 (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"). 

(b) Adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

(i) If the number of NBandT Financial Common Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time exceeds the number of NBandT Financial
Common Shares issued and outstanding as of the date hereof, except to the
extent such increase is due to the exercise of NBandT Financial Options or the
issuance of NBandT Financial Common Shares pursuant to the dividend reinvestment
feature of the NBandT Financial ESOP, the Merger Consideration will not be
adjusted as a result of such excess, though appropriate adjustments will be
made to the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration.

(ii) If Peoples changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number
of shares of Peoples Common Shares issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or
similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Peoples Common Shares, and
the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted so the shareholders of NBandT Financial at the Effective
Time shall receive Merger Consideration that produces the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

(c) Treasury Shares. All Treasury Shares shall be canceled and retired at the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

(d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or
elsewhere to the contrary, any holder of an outstanding NBandT Financial Common
Share that seeks relief as a dissenting shareholder under Section 1701.85 of
the OGCL shall thereafter have only such rights (and shall have such
obligations) as are provided therein, and the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to deliver only such cash payments to which the Dissenting Shares are
entitled pursuant to 1701.85 of the OGCL. If any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall forfeit such right to payment of the fair value under Section 1701.85 of
the OGCL, each holder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest.

3.02 Rights as Shareholders; Share Transfers. At the Effective Time, holders
of NBandT Financial Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as, shareholders of NBandT Financial, other than (a) to receive any dividend or
other distribution with respect to such NBandT Financial Common Shares with a
record date occurring prior to the Effective Time, (b) to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, or (c) to dissenting shareholders' rights in the
case of Dissenting Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of NBandT Financial or the Surviving
Corporation of any NBandT Financial Common Shares.

3.03 Exchange and Payment Procedures.

(a) Exchange Agent. Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, or any another transfer
agent selected by Peoples, will act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for purposes of conducting the exchange and payment procedures as
described in this Section 3.03. 

(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Peoples shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent cash in an aggregate amount
sufficient to make the appropriate payments (i) of the Per Share Cash
Consideration, (ii) in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.03(d)
and (iii) cash payment due to holders of the NBandT Financial Options pursuant
to Section 3.04 (such certificates and cash being referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund
as directed by Peoples; provided that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of NBandT
Financial Common Shares. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Peoples. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled
to vote or to exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Peoples
Common Shares held by it in the Exchange Fund, except that it shall receive
and hold in trust for the recipients of the Peoples Common Shares until
distributed thereto pursuant to the provision of this Agreement all dividends
or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such Peoples Common
Shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

(c) Exchange Procedures.

(i) Within five business days after the Effective Time, Peoples shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of an outstanding
certificate or certificates which, as of the Effective Time, represented NBandT
Financial Common Shares (other than Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares)
("Old Certificates") or uncertificated shares (i) a letter of transmittal
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the shares of Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Old Certificates, if applicable, or upon delivery of the letter of
transmittal in the case of uncertificated shares, to the Exchange Agent, and
which shall be in customary form as directed by Peoples and reasonably
acceptable to NBandT Financial, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Old Certificates, if applicable, or the letter of transmittal
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the Old
Certificates, if applicable, and a properly completed and duly executed letter
of transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by Peoples or the Exchange Agent, the holders of such
Old Certificates or uncertificated shares shall be entitled to receive the
number of whole shares of Peoples Common Shares that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(i) and a check in the amount equal to
the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
3.01(a)(ii) (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.03, and
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 3.02). Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Within ten days following receipt of the properly completed letter of
transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, the Exchange Agent
shall distribute Peoples Common Shares and cash as provided herein. If there
is a transfer of ownership of any shares of NBandT Financial Common Shares not
registered in the transfer records of NBandT Financial, the Merger Consideration
shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the Old Certificates representing
such NBandT Financial Common Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Peoples
and the Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

(ii) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Peoples Common Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement
shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of Peoples Common
Shares hereunder until such Person surrenders his, her or its Old
Certificates, if applicable, and the letter of transmittal in accordance with
this Section 3.03. Upon the surrender of such Person's Old Certificates, if
applicable, and the letter of transmittal, such Person shall be entitled to
receive any dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which
subsequent to the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect
to shares of Peoples Common Shares represented by such Person's Old
Certificates or uncertificated shares.

(d) No Fractional Peoples Common Shares. No certificates representing
fractional Peoples Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of the Old Certificates, and such fractional Peoples Common Share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
shareholder of the Surviving Corporation. Each holder of NBandT Financial Common
Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional Peoples Common
Share shall receive from the Exchange Agent an amount of cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional Peoples Common Share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all NBandT Financial
Common Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be
entitled by (ii) the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of
Peoples Common Shares as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market® for the
ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective Date.

(e) Release of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of NBandT Financial for six months after the
Effective Time shall be paid to Peoples. Any shareholders of NBandT Financial
who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look
only to Peoples for payment of the Merger Consideration.

(f) No Liability. None of Peoples, NBandT Financial or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any former holder of NBandT Financial Common Shares for any payment
of the Per Share Stock Consideration, the Per Share Cash Consideration, any
cash in lieu of a fractional Peoples Common Share interest, or any dividends
or distributions with respect to Peoples Common Shares delivered to a public
official if required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and substance
acceptable to Peoples and, if required by Peoples or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Peoples or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of NBandT Financial Common Shares
represented by such Old Certificate. 

(h) Withholding Rights. Peoples or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of NBandT Financial Common Shares such amounts as
Peoples or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other provision of
domestic or foreign tax law (whether national, federal, state, provincial,
local or otherwise). To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority by Peoples or the Peoples Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the NBandT Financial Common Shares.

(i) Book Entry. All shares of Peoples Common Shares to be issued in the Merger
shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates; provided,
that Peoples may issue any of such shares in physical form at its sole
discretion.



(j) Waiver. The Surviving Corporation may from time to time, in the case of
one or more Persons, waive one or more of the rights provided to it in this
Article III to withhold certain payments, deliveries and distributions; and no
such waiver shall constitute a waiver of its rights thereafter to withhold any
such payment, delivery or distribution in the case of any person.

3.04 NBandT Financial Options.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all rights with respect to NBandT
Financial Common Shares pursuant to NBandT Financial Option Plans (the "NBandT
Financial Options") shall be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to
$31.00 less the exercise price per share of such NBandT Financial Option (the
"Option Cash-Out Amount"). All unvested NBandT Financial Options will be
accelerated immediately prior to cancellation in exchange for the cash payment
in accordance with this Section 3.04.

(b) The NBandT Financial Board and its compensation committee shall not make any
grants of NBandT Financial Options following the execution of this Agreement,
except grants required to be made to the directors of NBandT Financial pursuant
to the NBandT Financial 2014 Equity Plan immediately following each annual
meeting of shareholders.



(c) The NBandT Financial Board or its compensation committee shall make such
adjustments and amendments to or make such determinations with respect to the
NBandT Financial Options to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.04.



3.05 Tax Consequences.



(a)For federal income tax purposes, the Parent Merger is intended to
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. The parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the tax
opinion referred to in Section 7.02(e) cannot be rendered (as reasonably
determined by Vorys) as a result of the Parent Merger potentially failing to
satisfy the "continuity of interest" requirements under applicable federal
income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the
Code, then Peoples shall increase the Per Share Stock Consideration (and cause
a corresponding decrease in the Per Share Cash Consideration equal to the
economic value of any such increase) to the minimum extent necessary to enable
the relevant tax opinion to be rendered.

either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof, as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04, or to one or more of its respective
covenants contained in Article IV or Article VI; provided, however, that the
mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to have or result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the party making the representation. 

5.02 Standard. No party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a
representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or
taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with
any representation or warranty contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04, has had or
is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect without giving any
effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set
forth in such representations and warranties.

5.03 Representations and Warranties of NBandT Financial. Subject to Sections
5.01 and 5.02 and except as Previously Disclosed in a section of its
Disclosure Schedule, NBandT Financial hereby represents and warrants to Peoples
that the following are true and correct (provided that none of the following
representations and warranties shall be applicable to the Title Agency, which
NBandT Financial does not deem to be, and which for purposes of this Agreement
is not, a Subsidiary):

(a) Organization, Standing and Authority.

(i) NBandT Financial is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in any foreign jurisdictions where its
ownership or leasing of property or assets or the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified. The foreign jurisdictions in which NBandT
Financial conducts business are set forth in the NBandT Financial's Disclosure
Schedule. NBandT Financial is registered as a financial holding company under
the BHCA.

(ii) NBTC is a national banking association duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the United States, and has all the requisite power
and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in any foreign
jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or assets or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified.

(b) Capital Structure of NBandT Financial.

(i) As of June 30, 2014, the authorized capital stock of NBandT Financial
consists of 6,000,000 NBandT Financial Common Shares and 100,000 shares of
preferred stock, with no par value ("NBandT Financial Preferred Shares"). The
NBandT Financial Common Shares and NBandT Financial Preferred Shares are
collectively referred to herein as "NBandT Financial Shares." As of the date
hereof, there are: (A) 3,429,560 shares of NBandT Financial Common Shares issued
and outstanding, including 306,683 shares held by the NBandT Financial Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (the "NBandT Financial ESOP"); (B) 389,390 shares of
Treasury Shares were held by NBandT Financial or otherwise owned by NBandT
Financial or its Subsidiaries; and (C) 518,122 shares of NBandT Financial
reserved for issuance pursuant to the NBandT Financial Option Plans (of which,
collectively, options to purchase 255,122 shares are outstanding at the date
hereof). No shares of NBandT Financial Preferred Shares are issued and
outstanding or reserved for issuance. All of the issued and outstanding shares
of NBandT Financial Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except for the
options, plans and other obligations set forth in this paragraph (i), and
except as set forth in NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule, NBandT Financial
does not have and is not bound by any outstanding or issued Rights with
respect to any NBandT Financial Shares. 

(ii) The NBandT Financial Options have been granted in compliance in all
material respects with the terms of the applicable NBandT Financial Option Plan
and all applicable laws. With respect to each NBandT Financial Option
outstanding as of the date hereof, the name of each optionee, the date of each
option to purchase NBandT Financial Common Shares granted, the number of shares
subject to each such option and the price at which each such option may be
exercised are set forth in NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule. The exercise
price of each NBandT Financial Option is no less than the fair market value of a
share of NBandT Financial Common Shares determined on the date of grant of such
stock option (and as of any later modification thereof within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code). Each NBandT Financial Option intended to qualify as
an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code has been structured
to so qualify.

(iii) Except as set forth in NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule, neither
NBandT Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries have any authorized, issued, or
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness for which the
holders thereof have the right to vote on any matters on which the
shareholders have the right to vote. There are no registration rights, and
there is no voting trust, proxy, rights agreement, "poison pill" anti-takeover
plan or other agreement or understanding to which NBandT Financial is a party or
by which it is bound with respect to any equity security of any class of NBandT
Financial or with respect to any equity security, partnership interest or
similar ownership interest of any class of any of its Subsidiaries.



(c) Subsidiaries.

(i) NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
of each Subsidiary of NBandT Financial.

(ii)(A) NBandT Financial owns all of the issued and outstanding equity
securities of its Subsidiaries, (B) no equity securities of its Subsidiaries
are or may become required to be issued (other than to NBandT Financial) by

understandings or arrangements by which any of its Subsidiaries is or may be
bound to sell or otherwise transfer any equity securities in such Subsidiaries
(other than to NBandT Financial), (D) there are no contracts, commitments,
understandings, or arrangements relating to NBandT Financial's rights to vote or
to dispose of such securities, and (E) all of the equity securities of each of
NBandT Financial's Subsidiaries held by NBandT Financial are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by NBandT Financial free and clear of any Liens.

required to be disclosed by NBandT Financial in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to NBandT Financial's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of NBandT Financial required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. NBandT Financial has disclosed, based on its most

Financial's Knowledge, any of the current or former directors or executive
officers of it or any of its Subsidiaries (and it is not aware of any basis
for any such suit, action, claim or proceeding, or to NBandT Financial's
Knowledge investigation or review) (i) that involves a Governmental Authority,
or (ii) that, individually or in the aggregate, is (A) material to it and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or is reasonably likely to result in a
material restriction on its or any of its Subsidiaries' businesses or, after
the Effective Time, the business of Peoples or any of its Affiliates, or (B)
reasonably likely to materially prevent or delay it from performing its
obligations under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement. There is no injunction, order, award, judgment, settlement or

"Employees"), consultant or former consultant (the "Consultants") or director
or former director (the "Directors") of NBandT Financial or NBTC or any ERISA
Affiliate participates, sponsors or contributes, or to which any such
Employees, Consultants or Directors are a party or under which NBandT Financial
or its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has any present or future liability
(the "Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Except as otherwise provided in this

(ii) Except as set forth in NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule, to the
Knowledge of NBandT Financial: (A) each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code,
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, or any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings,
disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other
applicable law have been timely made; (B) each Compensation and Benefit Plan
which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has either received favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and no circumstances exist which

relating to the Compensation and Benefit Plans; (D) neither NBandT Financial nor

Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA; and (E) no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that could result in a material increase in
premium cost of a Compensation and Benefit Plan that is insured, or a material
increase in benefit cost of such Compensation and Benefit Plans that are self-
insured.

(iii) None of the Compensation and Benefit Plans is subject to Title IV of
ERISA. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by NBandT Financial or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15)

any entity (an "ERISA Affiliate") which is considered one employer with NBandT
Financial under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or (c) of the
Code (an "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). None of NBandT Financial, its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to
either a defined benefit pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or to a
multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA at any time since

Section 4043 of ERISA, has been required to be filed for any Compensation and
Benefit Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate Plan. To the Knowledge of NBandT
Financial, except as set forth in NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule there
is no pending investigation or enforcement action by the U.S. Department of
Labor or the IRS or any other governmental agency with respect to any
Compensation and Benefit Plan.

(iv) Except as set forth in NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule, all
contributions required to be made under the terms of any Compensation and
Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee benefit arrangements
under any collective bargaining agreement to which NBandT Financial or any of
its Subsidiaries was or is a party have been timely made or have been
reflected on financial statements in NBandT Financial SEC Reports. 

(v) Except as otherwise provided under Section 6.10(c), except as set forth in
NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule, neither NBandT Financial nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligations to provide retiree health and life insurance
or other retiree death benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, other
than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code, and each such
Compensation and Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without incurring
liability thereunder. There has been no communication to Employees by NBandT
Financial or its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to promise or
guarantee such Employees' retiree health or life insurance or other retiree
death benefits on a permanent basis.

maintain any Compensation and Benefit Plans covering leased or foreign (i.e.,
non-United States) Employees, independent contractors or non-employees.

respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, if applicable, NBandT Financial

(viii) Except as set forth in NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would not,
directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result of any
termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time) reasonably
be expected to (A) entitle any Employee, Consultant or Director to any payment
(including severance pay or similar compensation) or any increase in
compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of any benefits under
any Compensation and Benefit Plan, or (C) result in any material increase in
benefits payable under any Compensation and Benefit Plan. 

(ix) Except as set forth in NBandT Financial's Disclosure Schedule, neither NBandT
Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate maintains any
compensation plans, programs or arrangements the payments under which would
not reasonably be expected to be deductible as a result of the limitations
under Section 162(m) of the Code and the Treasury regulations issued
thereunder.

this Agreement (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination
of employment prior to or following the Effective Time), none of Peoples, NBandT
Financial or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries will be obligated to make a payment that would be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code and
applicable regulations thereunder) of NBandT Financial on a consolidated basis
or which would violate 12 U.S.C. Section 1828(k) or regulations thereunder.

(o) Labor Matters. Neither NBandT Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
NBandT Financial or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding
asserting that it or any such Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor
practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking
to compel NBandT Financial or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike
or other labor dispute involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to
NBandT Financial's Knowledge, threatened, nor is NBandT Financial aware of any
activity involving its or any of its Subsidiaries' employees seeking to
certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational
activity. NBandT Financial and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours.

Schedule, NBandT Financial has taken all action required to be taken by NBandT
Financial in order to exempt this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the

occurred with respect to any of them or any such property that is reasonably
likely to result in material liability under Environmental Laws; and (2)
neither NBandT Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, in the five
years prior to this Agreement, any notice from any Person that NBandT Financial
or its Subsidiaries or the operation or condition of any property presently,
or previously owned, leased, operated, or held as collateral or in a fiduciary
capacity by any of them are or were in material violation of or otherwise are
alleged to have material liability under any Environmental Law, including, but
not limited to, legal liability (or potential liability) for the cleanup or

Raymond James and Associates, Inc., as of the date hereof, as to the fairness
from a financial point of view to Peoples of the Merger Consideration to be
paid by the Peoples in the Merger.

(n) Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Peoples nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that, either individually or when combined with all liabilities as
to similar matters, would have a Material Adverse Effect on Peoples on a
consolidated basis, except as disclosed in the SEC Reports.

(o) Regulatory Approvals; No Defaults.

(i) No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any

why the approvals set forth in Section 7.01(b) will not be received without
the imposition of a condition, restriction or requirement of the type
described in Section 7.01(b). 

(ii) Subject to the consents and approvals noted in Section 5.03(f)(i) and the
expiration of related regulatory waiting periods, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (A) result in a breach or violation
of, or a default under, or give rise to any Lien, any acceleration of remedies
or any right of termination under, any law, rule or regulation or any
judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or license, or agreement,
indenture or instrument of Peoples or of any of its Subsidiaries or to which
Peoples or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is subject or bound, (B)

in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.



(q) Tax Matters. All material Tax Returns that were or are required to be

available to NBandT Financial true and correct copies of the United States
federal income Tax Returns filed by Peoples and its Subsidiaries for each of
the three most recent fiscal years. Neither Peoples nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material liability with respect to any Taxes in excess of
the amounts accrued with respect thereto that are reflected in Peoples'
financial statements or that have arisen in the ordinary and usual course of
business since March 31, 2014. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of
Peoples or any of its Subsidiaries other than Liens for current Taxes not yet
due and payable.

Peoples in order to exempt this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby from, and this Agreement, the
Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are
exempt from, (i) the requirements of any Takeover Laws, and (ii) any
applicable provisions of the Peoples Articles, the Peoples Regulations and/or

relating to Peoples and its Subsidiaries that is to be contained in the

approvals under applicable state securities laws, any filing pursuant to Rule
165 or Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange
Act, or in any other document filed with any other Governmental Authorities in
connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading and will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other governing
laws or regulations, as applicable.

leading up to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder,
which have not yet been prepared, approved, executed and/or placed in Peoples
minute books, (1) the books of account, minute books, stock record books, and
other financial and corporate records of Peoples and its Subsidiaries, all of

all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with sound
business practices and, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Peoples and its
Subsidiaries; and (2) the minute books of Peoples and its Subsidiaries contain

Agreement, each of NBandT Financial and Peoples shall use its reasonable best
efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall cooperate fully with the other party hereto to
that end.

6.02 Shareholder Approvals.



(a) Each of Peoples and NBandT Financial shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable law and their respective organizational documents
to duly call, give notice of, convene and, as soon as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective, hold a meeting of its
shareholders and, except as otherwise provided herein, use its reasonable best
efforts to take such other actions necessary to obtain the relevant
shareholder approvals, in each case as promptly as practicable for the purpose
of obtaining the Peoples Shareholder Adoption and the NBandT Financial
Shareholder Adoption. Each party shall cooperate and keep the other party
informed on a current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting
results following the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
the shareholders of each party. Each member of the NBandT Financial Board shall
have executed and delivered to Peoples a Voting Agreement concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, NBandT Financial shall not be required to hold the
NBandT Financial Meeting if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01 prior to the scheduled time of the NBandT Financial Meeting.



(b) Except in the case of an Acceptance of Superior Proposal permitted by
Section 6.06, NBandT Financial shall solicit, and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, the NBandT Financial Shareholder Adoption at the NBandT
Financial Meeting. Subject to Section 6.06(d), NBandT Financial shall (i)
through the NBandT Financial Board, recommend to its shareholders adoption of
this Agreement (the "NBandT Financial Recommendation"), and (ii) include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. In connection with the

conduct the vote of participants in accordance with the requirements of Code
section 409(e) and shall vote, or direct the trustee of the NBandT Financial
ESOP how to vote, the NBandT Financial Common Shares at the meeting of the
shareholders contemplated by the terms of this Section in accordance with its
ERISA fiduciary duties.

6.03 Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(a) Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Peoples and NBandT
Financial shall promptly cause the Registration Statement to be prepared and
Peoples shall cause the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC.
Peoples and NBandT Financial shall use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as
soon as practicable after the filing thereof. The parties shall cooperate in
responding to and considering any questions or comments from the SEC staff
regarding the information contained in the Registration Statement. If at any
time after the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, and prior to the
Effective Time, any event relating to NBandT Financial or Peoples is discovered
by NBandT Financial or Peoples, as applicable, which should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Registration Statement, the discovering
party shall promptly inform the other party with all relevant information
relating to such event, whereupon Peoples shall promptly cause an appropriate
amendment to the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC. Upon the
effectiveness of such amendment, each of NBandT Financial and Peoples (if prior
to the meetings of the shareholders pursuant to Section 6.02 hereof) will take
all necessary action as promptly as practicable to permit an appropriate
amendment or supplement to be transmitted to the shareholders entitled to vote
at such meetings. Peoples shall also use reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and NBandT Financial
shall furnish all information concerning NBandT Financial and the holders of
NBandT Financial Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action. NBandT Financial and Peoples shall each furnish the other with
all information concerning each other and its directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Registration Statement. 

(b) Peoples and NBandT Financial each agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts and to cooperate with the other party in all reasonable respects to
prepare the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for filing with the SEC and, when
the Registration Statement is effective, for delivery to its respective
shareholders.

(c) If either party becomes aware prior to the Effective Time of any
information that would cause any of the statements in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, that party shall promptly inform the other
thereof and take the necessary steps to correct the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

6.04 Press Releases. Upon the execution of this Agreement, Peoples and NBandT
Financial shall issue a joint press release regarding this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which joint press release shall be subject
to the prior approval of Peoples and NBandT Financial. Neither NBandT Financial
nor Peoples will, without the prior approval of the other party, issue any
other press release or written statement for general circulation relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, except as otherwise may be required by
applicable law or regulation before such consent can be obtained.

6.05 Access; Information.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of NBandT Financial and Peoples shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford Representatives of the other party,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other
party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
documents filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking or
insurance laws, and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request, including
periodic updates of the information provided in Section 5.03(ii). NBandT
Financial shall invite one Representative of Peoples selected by Peoples from
time to time to attend, solely as observer, all meetings of the NBandT Financial
Board (and committees thereof) and NBTC board after the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall such Peoples
Representative be invited to or permitted to attend any executive session of
NBandT Financial's or NBTC's board, any meeting at which NBandT Financial
reasonably determines that such attendance is inconsistent with the fiduciary
obligations or confidentiality requirements of the NBandT Financial Board or
NBTC board, as applicable, or any meeting or part of a meeting at which the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are to be discussed. Neither NBandT
Financial nor Peoples, nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries, contravene any law, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, or relating to its
directors', officers', employees', agents', investment bankers' or financial
advisors' consideration or deliberation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or an Acquisition Proposed. 

(b) Neither NBandT Financial nor Peoples will, nor shall either party's
Representatives, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05
(as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such information will be subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section
6.16.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated, each
party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof
containing information and data as to another party hereto to be returned to
the party which furnished the same. No investigation by either party of the
business and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
conditions to either party's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
as soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event
more than 30 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date
hereof, each of NBandT Financial and Peoples will furnish to the other (i) its
consolidated financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of
operations and stockholders' equity) to the extent available as of and for
such month then ended, (ii) internal management reports showing actual
financial performance against plan and previous period, and (iii) to the
extent permitted by applicable law, any reports provided to the NBandT Financial
Board or the Peoples Board or any committee thereof relating to the financial
performance and risk management of the company or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.06 No Solicitation.

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the first to occur of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, NBandT Financial shall not,
and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors,
employees, advisors and other agents of NBandT Financial and its Subsidiaries
not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate
(including by way of providing information) or induce any inquiry, proposal or
offer with respect to, or the making or completion of, any Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead
to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person or Group any confidential or nonpublic information with respect to or
in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) take any other action
intended to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose to approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement related thereto, (v) enter
into any agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Transaction or Acquisition Proposal, (vi) enter into any agreement or
agreement in principle requiring, directly or indirectly, NBandT Financial to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or breach its obligations hereunder, or (vii) propose or agree to do any of
the foregoing.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.06(a), if NBandT
Financial or any of its Representatives receives an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of Section 6.06(a), NBandT Financial and its Representatives may take any
action described in Section 6.06(a)(ii), if, and only if, the NBandT Financial
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with NBandT Financial's
outside legal and financial advisors, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably capable of becoming a Superior Proposal, and (ii)
the failure to take such action would cause the NBandT Financial Board to
violate its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of NBandT Financial under
applicable Law; provided, that NBandT Financial receives from such Person or
Group an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable
to NBandT Financial than the confidentiality terms of this Agreement.

(c) As promptly as practicable (but in no event more than two business days)
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, NBandT Financial shall (i) advise Peoples in writing of
the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, (ii) shall
promptly provide to Peoples a written summary of the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry including the identity of the Person
or Group making the Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) shall keep Peoples
promptly apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations
(including providing Peoples with a copy of all material documentation and
correspondence relating thereto) on a current basis. NBandT Financial agrees
that it shall simultaneously provide to Peoples any information concerning
NBandT Financial that may be provided (pursuant to Section 6.06(b)) to any other
Person or Group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which has not
previously been provided to Peoples.



(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
NBandT Financial Meeting, NBandT Financial may accept or approve a Superior
Proposal and withdraw its recommendation of this Agreement ("Acceptance of
Superior Proposal") and terminate this Agreement, if and only if (x) from and
after the date hereof, NBandT Financial has complied with Sections 6.02 and
6.06, and (y) the Board of Directors of NBandT Financial has determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, that the NBandT Financial Board may not effect a Acceptance of
Superior Proposal unless:



(i) NBandT Financial shall have received an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal and the NBandT Financial Board shall have concluded in good
faith (after consultation with NBandT Financial's financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, after
taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement agreed to
or proposed by Peoples;



(ii) NBandT Financial shall have provided prior written notice to Peoples at
least five business days in advance (the "Notice Period") of taking such
action, which notice shall advise Peoples that the NBandT Financial Board has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person or Group making
the Superior Proposal);



(iii) during the Notice Period, NBandT Financial shall, and shall cause its
financial advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Peoples in good
faith (to the extent Peoples desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and



(iv) the NBandT Financial Board shall have concluded in good faith (after
consultation with NBandT Financial's financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that, after considering the results of such negotiations and giving
effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications offered or agreed to by
Peoples, if any, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal.



If during the Notice Period any material revisions are made to the Superior
Proposal, NBandT Financial shall deliver a new written notice to Peoples giving
rise to a new three business day Notice Period and shall again comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.06(d) with respect to such new written notice.



(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the NBandT Financial or
the NBandT Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act.

(f) As used in this Agreement:

(i) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal on
terms which the NBandT Financial Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with NBandT Financial's outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors, and taking into account all the legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, including execution
risk and risks as to certainty and timing of consummation, would, if
consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the holders of
NBandT Financial Common Shares from a financial point of view than the terms of
this Agreement (in each case, taking into account any revisions to this
Agreement made or proposed by Peoples); provided that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20% or more" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed
to be references to "50% or more."



(ii) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal, offer, inquiry, or indication
of interest (whether binding or non-binding, and whether communicated to NBandT
Financial or publicly announced to NBandT Financial 's shareholders) by any
Person or Group (in each case other than Peoples or any of its Affiliates)
relating to an Acquisition Transaction involving NBandT Financial or any of its
present or future consolidated Subsidiaries, or any combination of such
Subsidiaries, the purchase assets of which constitute 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of NBandT Financial as reflected on NBandT Financial's
consolidated statement of condition prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.



(iii) "Acquisition Transaction" means any transaction or series of related
transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
involving (i) any acquisition (whether direct or indirect, including by way of
merger, share exchange, consolidation, business combination or other similar
transaction) or purchase from NBandT Financial by any Person or "group" (as such
term is defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act), other than Peoples
or any of its affiliates, of 20% or more in interest of the total outstanding
voting securities of NBandT Financial or any of its Subsidiaries (measured by
voting power), or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person or Group, other than Peoples or any of its affiliates,
beneficially owning 20% or more in interest of the total outstanding voting
securities of NBandT Financial or any of its Subsidiaries (measured by voting
power), or any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction involving NBandT Financial pursuant to which the
shareholders of NBandT Financial immediately preceding such transaction would
hold less than 50% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction (or, if applicable, the ultimate parent thereof)
(measured by voting power), (ii) any sale or lease or exchange, transfer,
license, acquisition or disposition of a business, deposits or assets that
constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets, business, revenues, net
income, assets or deposits of NBandT Financial, or (iii) any liquidation or
dissolution of NBandT Financial or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.07 Takeover Laws. No party hereto shall take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement to become
subject to requirements imposed by the Takeover Laws and each of them shall
take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from or, if necessary, challenge the validity
or applicability of, the Takeover Laws, as now or hereafter in effect.

6.08 Certain Policies. Before the Effective Time, NBandT Financial shall, upon
the request of Peoples, (i) modify and change its loan, investment portfolio,
asset liability management and real estate valuation policies and practices
(including, but not limited to, loan classifications and levels of reserves)
so that such policies and practices may be applied on a basis that is
consistent with those of Peoples, and (ii) evaluate the need for any reserves
including, but not limited to, reserves relating to any outstanding
litigation, any Tax audits or any liabilities to be incurred upon cancellation
of any contracts as a result of the Merger; provided, however, that NBandT
Financial shall not be obligated to take any such action pursuant to this
Section 6.08 unless and until Peoples irrevocably acknowledges that all
conditions to its obligation to consummate the Merger have been satisfied
(including, but not limited to, the receipt of the regulatory approvals
required by Section 7.01(b) and Peoples Shareholder Approval), irrevocably
certifies to NBandT Financial that Peoples' representations and warranties,
subject to Section 5.02, are true and correct as of such date and that Peoples
is otherwise in material compliance with this Agreement and irrevocably waives
in writing any and all rights that it may have to terminate this Agreement;
provided further, however, that NBandT Financial shall not be obligated to take
any such action pursuant to this Section 6.08 if such action would be
inconsistent with GAAP. NBandT Financial's representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or
breached in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications
or changes undertaken solely on account of this Section 6.08. 

6.09 Regulatory Applications.

(a) Peoples and NBandT Financial and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to allow Peoples to
prepare, submit and file all applications and requests for regulatory
approval, to timely effect all filings and to obtain all consents, approvals
and/or authorizations of all the Regulatory Authorities necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
rights under this Section, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable. Peoples agrees that it will consult with NBandT
Financial with respect to the obtaining of all material consents, approvals
and authorizations from the Regulatory Authorities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to keep NBandT Financial
apprised of the status of material matters relating to obtainment of such
consents, approvals and/or authorizations from the Regulatory Authorities.
NBandT Financial shall have the right to review in advance, subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all material written
information submitted to the Regulatory Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the forgoing
sentence, NBandT Financial shall not have any right to review and/or inspect any
proprietary information submitted by Peoples to any Regulatory Authority with
a request for confidential treatment, including, but not limited to any
business plan and/or financial data or analysis prepared by Peoples in
relation to such consents, approvals and/or authorizations from the Regulatory
Authorities.

(b) NBandT Financial agrees, upon request, to furnish Peoples with all
information concerning itself, NBTC, and their directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary, advisable
and/or required in connection with any filing, notice or application made by
or on behalf of Peoples or any of its Subsidiaries to any Regulatory
Authority.

6.10 Employment Matters; Employee Benefits.

(a) General.

(i) It is understood and agreed that nothing in this Section 6.10 or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract of employment or be
construed to give NBandT Financial's or any of its Subsidiaries' employees any
rights other than as employees at will under applicable law, and NBandT
Financial's and its Subsidiaries' employees shall not be deemed to be third-
party beneficiaries of this Agreement, except as set forth in Section
6.17(a)(with respect to indemnification). Employees of NBandT Financial or any
of its Subsidiaries who become employees of Peoples or any of its Subsidiaries
as a result of the Merger ("Continuing Employees") shall participate in
either: (A) the Compensation and Benefit Plans as defined in Section
5.03(n)(i) (for so long as Peoples determines necessary or appropriate); or
(B) the employee benefit plans sponsored by Peoples or any of its Subsidiaries
for their employees (with credit for years of service with NBandT Financial and
its Subsidiaries for participation and vesting purposes, to the extent such
plans can be amended to permit, including credit for years of service and for
seniority under vacation and sick pay plans and programs, but subject to the
eligibility and other terms of such plans). The prior sentence
notwithstanding, the Continuing Employees shall become eligible to participate
in Peoples' Retirement Savings Plan effective as of the first entry date after
the Effective Date by which a Continuing Employee has satisfied the age and
service eligibility provisions of Peoples' Retirement Savings Plan (taking
into account their years of service with NBandT Financial and its Subsidiaries).
In addition, to the extent Continuing Employees participate in a group health
plan of Peoples or any of its Subsidiaries (instead of continuing to
participate in a group health plan of NBandT Financial or any of its
Subsidiaries), all restrictions and limitations on pre-existing conditions
shall be waived to the extent the group health plan and insurance 

policy of Peoples or it Subsidiary permit (or may be amended to permit). In
the event that Peoples terminates the group health plans(s) of NBandT Financial
or any of its Subsidiaries, those former employees detailed on the Disclosure
Schedule who as of the date of this Agreement are currently participating
under such plan(s) as a result of the post-employment coverage rights
contained within those plan(s), and not as a result of continuation coverage
rights as a result of COBRA (collectively, "Eligible Retirees"), will be
eligible to participate in the group health plan(s) sponsored by Peoples or
any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of those plans, and all
restrictions and limitations on pre-existing conditions shall be waived to the
extent the group health plan and insurance policy of Peoples or it Subsidiary
permit (or may be amended to permit). To the extent the initial period of
coverage for any of the Continuing Employees or Eligible Retirees under any
such plan sponsored by Peoples or any of its Subsidiaries is not a full
12-month period of coverage, the Continuing Employees and Eligible Retirees
shall be given credit under the applicable plan for any deductibles and co-
insurance payments made by them under the corresponding plan sponsored by NBandT
Financial or any of its Subsidiaries during the balance of such 12-month
period of coverage, provided that Peoples can obtain, in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to Peoples, the necessary data and provided that the insurer
agrees. In the event the insurer does not agree, Peoples shall take all action
necessary to ensure that Continuing Employees and Eligible Retirees do not
lose the value of their deductibles and co-insurance payments whether that be
by continuing the group health plan sponsored by NBandT Financial or any of its
Subsidiaries through the end of the applicable plan year or otherwise.

(ii) After the Effective Time, Peoples shall be liable for (A) all obligations
for continued health coverage under COBRA with respect to each qualified

FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT





THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of ________, 2014,
by and among Peoples Bancorp Inc., a financial holding company incorporated
under Ohio law ("Peoples"), and each of the undersigned shareholders of NBandT
Financial Group, Inc., a financial holding company incorporated under Ohio law
("NBandT Financial") (collectively, the "Shareholders").



WHEREAS, the Shareholders collectively own [_________] shares of common stock,
no par value, of NBandT Financial (such common shares, together with all shares
of NBandT Financial which may hereafter be acquired by the Shareholders prior to
the termination of this Agreement, shall be referred to herein as the
"Shares");



WHEREAS, Peoples and NBandT Financial propose to enter into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), which
provides, among other things, that NBandT Financial will merge with and into
Peoples pursuant to the Parent Merger (this and other capitalized terms used
and not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Merger Agreement); and



WHEREAS, Peoples and NBandT Financial have made it a condition to their entering
into the Merger Agreement that the Shareholders agree to vote the Shares in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE 1

Voting of Shares



1.1 Voting Agreement. The Shareholders, individually and not jointly, hereby
agree that, during the time this Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of the
shareholders of NBandT Financial, however called, and in any action by consent
of the shareholders of NBandT Financial, they shall vote their Shares (except
Shares held in a fiduciary capacity): (i) in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement (as amended from time to time) and (ii) against any proposal
for any recapitalization, merger, sale of assets or other business combination
between NBandT Financial or any of its Subsidiaries and any person or entity
other than Peoples or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other action or
agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of NBandT Financial under the
Merger Agreement or that would result in any of the conditions to the
obligations of NBandT Financial under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing contained herein is
intended to restrict any Shareholder from voting or otherwise acting in the
Shareholder's capacity as a director of NBandT Financial with respect to any
matter.





ARTICLE 2

Representations and Warranties



Each of the Shareholders, individually and not jointly, hereby represents and
warrants to Peoples as follows:



2.1 Authority Relative to this Agreement. He/She/It has all necessary power
and authority or capacity, as the case may be, to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform his, her or its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of such Shareholder, enforceable against
such Shareholder in accordance with its terms.



2.2 No Conflict.



(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder does not,
and the performance of this Agreement by him/her/it will not (i) conflict with
or violate any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to
him/her/it or by which the Shares are bound, or (ii) result in any breach of
or constitute a default (or event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
lien or encumbrance on any of the Shares held by him/her/it pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which he/she/it is a party or
by which he/she/it or any Shares of him/her/it are bound, except, in the case
of clauses (i) and (ii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not prevent or delay the performance
by such Shareholder of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by him/her/it does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by him/her/it will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
federal, state, local or foreign regulatory body.



2.3 Title to the Shares. Each of the Shareholders is the owner of the number
and class of Shares specified on Annex I hereto, free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of
any nature whatsoever except as otherwise specified on Annex I. No Shareholder
has appointed or granted any proxy, which appointment or grant is still
effective, with respect to the Shares. Each Shareholder has sole voting power
with respect to his, her or its Shares except as otherwise specified on Annex
I.



ARTICLE 3

Additional Covenants



3.1 Transfer of the Shares. Each of the Shareholders hereby covenants and
agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, the Shareholder will not,
without the prior written consent of Peoples, sell, pledge, transfer, or
otherwise voluntarily dispose of any of the Shares which are owned by the
Shareholder (except Shares held in a fiduciary capacity) or take any other
voluntary action which would have the effect of removing the Shareholder's
power to vote his, her or its Shares or which would otherwise be inconsistent
with this Agreement.



ARTICLE 4

Miscellaneous



4.1 Termination. This Agreement shall terminate on the earlier to occur of (i)
the date of consummation of the Merger and (ii) the date of termination of the
Merger Agreement for any reason whatsoever.



4.2 Specific Performance. The Shareholders agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that Peoples shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
law or in equity.



4.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings with
respect to the subject matter hereof.



4.4 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by all the parties hereto.



4.5 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.



4.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.



4.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one
and the same agreement.



4.8 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise.



4.9 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.



4.10 Transfers, Successors and Assigns.



(a) The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of the parties.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
party other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns
any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.



(b) Each transferee or assignee of the Shares subject to this Agreement shall
continue to be subject to the terms hereof, and, as a condition to the
recognition of such transfer, each transferee or assignee shall agree in
writing to be subject to each of the terms of this Agreement by executing and
delivering an Adoption Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A. Upon the execution and delivery of an Adoption Agreement by any
transferee, such transferee shall be deemed to be a party hereto as if such
transferee's signature appeared on the signature pages of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
party other than the parties hereto or their respective executors,
administrators, heirs, successors and assigns any rights, remedies,
obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement.



4.11 Spousal Consent. If any Shareholder who is a natural person is married on
the date of this Agreement, such Shareholder shall request the Shareholder's
spouse to execute and deliver to NBandT Financial a consent of spouse in the
form of Exhibit B hereto ("Consent of Spouse"), within 5 days of the date of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the execution and delivery thereof, such
consent shall not be deemed to confer or convey to the spouse any rights in
such Shareholder's shares of capital stock that do not otherwise exist by
operation of law or the agreement of the parties.
