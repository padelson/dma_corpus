or by Transferred Subsidiary as applicable, and among the Purchased Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities and the assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries by
asset category in accordance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code
and other applicable Law, except that if a section 338(h)(10) election is not
made, no allocation shall be made to the assets of a Transferred Subsidiary
that is a domestic corporation for purposes of the Code (the " _Proposed
Allocation_ "). Buyer shall have the right to consent or object to the
Proposed Allocation during the thirty (30) day period immediately following
delivery of the Proposed Allocation. If Buyer delivers a notice of objection
to Parent during that thirty (30) day period, Parent and Buyer shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to the Proposed
Allocation. If Buyer makes no objection during that thirty (30) day period or
Parent and Buyer agree on an allocation within the thirty (30) day period
following Buyers delivery of such a notice of objection, the Proposed
Allocation or the agreed allocation, as applicable, shall be final and binding
on Parent, on behalf of itself and Sellers, and Buyer (the " _Agreed-Upon
Allocation_ "). If Parent and Buyer are unable to reach agreement on the
Proposed Allocation within thirty (30) days following the delivery to Parent
of Buyers notice of objection to the Proposed Allocation, the allocation
shall be determined by an internationally-recognized independent accounting
firm mutually selected by Buyer and Parent (the " _Allocation Accounting Firm_
") using customary valuation methodologies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Allocation Accounting Firm shall make its determination within thirty (30)
days following the date on which the Allocation Accounting Firm is selected
pursuant to this _Section 2.03(c)_. The determination made by the Allocation
Accounting Firm of the allocation shall be, absent manifest error, final and
binding on Parent, on behalf of itself and Sellers, and Buyer (the " _Final
Allocation_ "). All negotiations pursuant to this this _Section 2.03(c)_
shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules of
evidence, and all negotiations and submissions to the Allocation Accounting
Firm, and the dispute resolution proceedings under this  _Section 2.03(c)_,
shall be treated as confidential information. The fees and expenses of the
Allocation Accounting Firm for its services rendered pursuant to this _Section
2.03(c)_ shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other,
in inverse proportion as each shall prevail on the dollar amounts of such
disputed items so submitted to the Allocation Accounting Firm as provided in
this _Section 2.03(c)_. The Agreed-Upon Allocation or Final Allocation, as
applicable, may be revised by mutual agreement between the Buyer and Parent,
from time to time, prior to and following the Closing so as to reflect any
matters that need updating (including adjustments to the Purchase Price
under  _Article X_ , if any).

 



29 (d) Each of Parent, Buyer and each of their respective Affiliates shall
prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax
Returns, including Form 8023 and Form 8594 if applicable, on a basis
consistent with the Agreed-Upon Allocation or Final Allocation, as applicable.
None of Parent, Buyer or their respective Affiliates shall take any position
inconsistent with the Agreed-Upon Allocation or Final Allocation, as
applicable, in any Tax Return, in any refund claim for any Tax, in any
litigation or administrative proceeding relating to any Tax, or
otherwise unless required by final determination by an applicable Taxation
Authority. In the event that the Agreed-Upon Allocation or Final Allocation,
as applicable, is disputed by any Taxation Authority, the party receiving
notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
Buyer, Parent and each of their respective Affiliates agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend such allocation in any audit or
similar proceeding.

 

SECTION 2.04. _Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. No later than three (3)
Business Days, but not more than five (5) Business Days, before the Closing
Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith estimate of the Net Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_
"), Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), and the Net Intercompany
Receivable or Net Intercompany Payable, as applicable (the " _Estimated
Net Intercompany Receivable_ " and " _Estimated Net Intercompany Payable_ "),
respectively) in each case as of the Reference Time, and the resulting
calculation of the Closing Payment, which statement shall be prepared in
accordance with _Exhibit C_. If the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the
Target Working Capital, such excess shall be called the " _Estimated Working
Capital Excess_." If the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target
Working Capital, such deficit shall be called the " _Estimated Working
Capital Deficit_." If following delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement,
Parent shall consult in good faith with Buyer regarding the amounts and
calculations therein, provide Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable
supporting documentation for the calculations included therein, and consider
in good faith any comments or modifications from Buyer with respect to such
amounts and calculations; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Estimated Closing Statement as referred to in this Agreement shall refer to
the statement delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.04_ as modified to
reflect such comments or modifications from Buyer accepted by Parent (acting
in good faith).

SECTION 2.05. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent within ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its
calculation of Net Working Capital, Cash, Indebtedness, and Net Intercompany
Receivable or Net Intercompany Payable, as applicable, in each case as of the
Reference Time (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ," " _Closing Cash_ ," "
_Closing Indebtedness_ ," " _Closing Net Intercompany Receivable_ ," and "
_Closing Net Intercompany Payable_ ," respectively), including reasonable
detail with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. Parent and any
accountants and advisors engaged by Parent shall be permitted reasonable
access to the books and records of the Transferred Subsidiaries and any
documents, schedules or workpapers used by Buyer in its calculation of the
Closing Working

 



30  Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and Closing Net Intercompany
Receivable or Closing Net Intercompany Payable, as applicable, for purposes of
evaluating Buyers calculation of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, and Closing Net Intercompany Receivable or Closing Net
Intercompany Payable, as applicable, and making its own calculations of such
amounts; _provided_ that the accountants of Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not be obligated to make any work papers available to Parent or its
Representatives except in accordance with such accountants normal disclosure
procedures and then only after Parent or such Representatives has signed a
customary agreement relating to access to any work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Statement is delivered to
Parent pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_, Parent shall deliver to Buyer either
(i) a written acknowledgement accepting the Closing Statement and the
calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness,
and Closing Net Intercompany Receivable or Closing Net Intercompany Payable,
as applicable, as set forth therein or (ii) a written report setting forth in
reasonable detail Parents objections and any proposed adjustments to the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and Closing Net Intercompany Receivable or Closing
Net Intercompany Payable, as applicable, along with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation (the " _Adjustment Report_ "). If Parent fails to
respond to Buyer within such thirty (30) day period, Parent shall be deemed to
have irrevocably accepted and agreed to the Closing Statement, including the
calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness,
and Closing Net Intercompany Receivable or Closing Net Intercompany Payable,
as applicable, as set forth therein.

 

(c) Following Buyers receipt of the Adjustment Report, if any, the parties
shall work in good faith to resolve Parents objections set forth therein and
the calculation of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, and Closing Net Intercompany Receivable or Closing Net
Intercompany Payable, as applicable. In the event Parent and Buyer fail to
agree on the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and
Closing Net Intercompany Receivable or Closing Net Intercompany Payable, as
applicable, within thirty (30) days after Buyer receives the Adjustment Report
(or such longer period as they may mutually agree), then Parent and Buyer
agree to submit any remaining disputed amounts to Ernst and Young LLP, or if
such firm is unable or unwilling to act, another internationally recognized
independent accounting or valuation firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and
Parent (the " _Working Capital Accounting Firm_ ") for computation or
verification in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Buyer and Parent
shall direct the Working Capital Accounting Firm to review the matters
remaining in dispute and, within thirty (30) days following its engagement (or
within the shortest time frame as the Working Capital Accounting Firm agrees),
deliver a written report to Buyer and Parent setting forth its determination
of the proper amounts of such disputed matters. Buyer and Parent shall enter
into a customary and reasonable engagement letter with the Working Capital
Accounting Firm. The Working Capital Accounting Firm shall consider only
the disputed matters that were included in the Adjustment Report that Buyer
and Parent were unable to resolve. Each of Buyer and Parent shall be entitled
to make a presentation to the Working Capital Accounting Firm regarding the
items and amounts that they are unable to resolve, but neither Buyer nor
Parent shall meet or have any conversations separately with the Working
Capital Accounting Firm (other than conversations limited to the submission of
a request for documents or information by the Working Capital Accounting Firm
to such party)

 



31  without the other partys prior written consent. Each of Buyer and Parent
may also furnish to the Working Capital Accounting Firm such other information
and documents as it deems relevant or such information and documents as may
be requested by the Working Capital Accounting Firm; _provided_ , that it
delivers a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to the other party. In
making its determination, the Working Capital Accounting Firm shall (i) be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the definitions
of Net Working Capital, Cash, Indebtedness, and Net Intercompany Receivable or
Net Intercompany Payable, as applicable, the methodology for calculating such
amounts, and the terms of this _Section 2.05(c)_, (ii) take into account only
the Closing Statement, the Adjustment Report, and information and documents
provided to the Working Capital Accounting Firm by or on behalf of Buyer or
Parent (i.e., not on the basis of independent review) and (iii) not assign any
value with respect to a disputed amount that is in excess of, or less than,
the greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for such item in the
Closing Statement or the Adjustment Report. Buyer and Parent shall cooperate
with the Working Capital Accounting Firm in connection with its determination
pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer and Parent shall, and shall cause their accountants to,
provide the Working Capital Accounting Firm all reasonable and timely access
to the work papers and other books and records and information as reasonably
necessary for the Working Capital Accounting Firm to perform its function as
arbitrator; _provided_ that the accountants of Buyer shall not be obligated to
make any work papers or other books and records or information available to
the Working Capital Accounting Firm except in accordance with such
accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after the Working
Capital Accounting Firm has signed a customary agreement relating to access to
any work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such accountants. The remedies provided this _Section 2.05(c)_ shall be the
exclusive remedy for resolving disputes related to the determination of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and Closing Net
Intercompany Receivable or Closing Net Intercompany Payable, as applicable,
and the decision of the Working Capital Accounting Firm shall be final and
binding on Parent and Buyer absent manifest error. All negotiations pursuant
to this this Section 2.05(c) shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
comparable state rules of evidence, and all negotiations and submissions to
the Working Capital Accounting Firm, and the dispute resolution proceedings
under this _Section 2.05(c)_, shall be treated as confidential information.
The costs and expenses of the Working Capital Accounting Firm for its services
rendered pursuant to this _Section 2.05(c)_ shall be borne by Parent, on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other, in inverse proportion as each shall prevail
on the dollar amounts of such disputed items so submitted to the Working
Capital Accounting Firm.

 

(d) The date on which the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, and Closing Net Intercompany Receivable or Closing
Net Intercompany Payable, as applicable, are finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.05_ shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Settlement
Date_."

 

(e) If (i) Closing Working Capital _plus_ Closing Cash _minus_ Closing
Indebtedness _plus_ Closing Net Intercompany Receivable, if applicable,
_minus_ Closing Net Intercompany Payable, if applicable, as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.05 _exceeds (ii) Estimated Working Capital plus
Estimated Cash _minus_ Estimated Indebtedness _plus_ Estimated Net
Intercompany Receivable, if applicable, _minus_ Estimated Net Intercompany

 



32  Payable, if applicable, then Buyer shall pay to Parent such excess. If (i)
Closing Working Capital _plus_ Closing Cash _minus_ Closing Indebtedness
_plus_ Closing Net Intercompany Receivable, if applicable, _minus_ Closing
Net Intercompany Payable, if applicable, as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.05_ is less than (ii) Estimated Working Capital _plus_
Estimated Cash  _minus_ Estimated Indebtedness _plus_ Estimated Net
Intercompany Receivable, if applicable, _minus_ Estimated Net Intercompany
Payable, if applicable, then Parent shall pay to Buyer such deficit.

 

(f) Any payment required pursuant to (i) the first sentence of _Section
2.05(e)_ shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Settlement
Date by the transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by Parent in writing to Buyer within three (3) Business Days after
the Settlement Date, or (ii) the second sentence of  _Section 2.05(e)_ shall
be made within five (5) Business Days after the Settlement Date by the
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Buyer
in writing to Parent within three (3) Business Days after the Settlement
Date. All such payments shall be considered an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, including for purposes of any Tax, and this adjustment to the Purchase
Price will include any applicable VAT in relation to the Purchase Price
as provided in _Section 7.08_.

SECTION 2.06. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Interests and the Purchased Assets
and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement
shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at the offices of
Alston and Bird LLP, One Atlantic Center, 1201 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta,
GA 30309 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the third (3rd) Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereto set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions
that by their terms cannot be satisfied until Closing, but subject to their
satisfaction or waiver at the Closing); _provided_ , that if the Marketing
Period has not ended on or prior to the time the Closing would have otherwise
been required to occur pursuant to the foregoing, the Closing shall not occur
until the earlier to occur of (i) a Business Day during the Marketing
Period specified by Buyer on no fewer than three Business Days written
notice to Parent (it being understood that such date may be conditioned upon
the simultaneous completion of the Debt Financing) and (ii) the third Business
Day following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject, in the case of
each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of all of the conditions set forth
in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot
be satisfied until Closing, but subject to their satisfaction or waiver at the
Closing)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may be consummated at
such other place or at such other time or on such other date as Parent and
Buyer may mutually agree in writing (the date of the Closing, the " _Closing
Date_ ").

35 ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

 

Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule to which such representation and warranty relates, Parent and
Sellers hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Buyer as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as follows:

 

SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Authority and Qualification_.

 

(a) Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all necessary
corporate power and authority to (i) own, operate or lease the properties,
rights and assets owned, operated or leased by it that are related to the
Business (including the Purchased Assets or the Interests, as applicable) and
to carry on the Business as it has been and is currently conducted, (ii)
enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is or will be a party, (iii) carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and (iv) consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Parent is duly authorized, licensed or qualified to do business and
is in good standing (or its local equivalent) under the Laws in each
jurisdiction in which the properties, rights or assets owned or leased by it
or the operation of the Business by it makes such authorization, licensing or
qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing has not had and would not have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. Assuming the accuracy of Buyers
representation in _Section 4.10_, the execution and delivery by Parent of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a
party, the performance by Parent of its obligations hereunder and thereunder
and the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the
part of Parent. This Agreement has been, and upon their execution each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which Parent is a party will be, (i) duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent, and, (ii) assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto and thereto (other
than Affiliates of Parent), a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting enforcement of creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding
at law or in equity) (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ "). 

(b) Each Seller has been duly incorporated or formed, is a validly existing
legal entity and, where applicable, is in good standing (or its local
equivalent) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
formation, and has all necessary corporate (or other) power and authority to
(i) own, operate or lease the properties, rights and assets now owned,
operated or leased by it that are related to the Business (including the
Purchased Assets or the Interests, as applicable) and to carry on the Business
as it has been and is currently conducted, (ii) enter into, 

 



36  execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is or will be a party, (iii) carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and (iv) consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Each Seller is duly authorized, licensed or qualified to do business
and is in good standing (or its local equivalent) under the Laws in each
jurisdiction in which the properties, rights or assets owned or leased by it
or the operation of the Business by it makes such authorization, licensing or
qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing has not had and would not have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller is a wholly owned, direct or
indirect, Subsidiary of Parent. The execution and delivery by each Seller of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party,
the performance by such Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder
and the consummation by such Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby will be, when executed as provided in this Agreement, duly
authorized by all requisite corporate (or other) action on the part of such
Seller. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which a Seller is a
party will be, when executed as provided in this Agreement, (i) duly and
validly executed and delivered by such Seller and, (ii) assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto and
thereto (other than Parent or any Affiliates of Parent), a legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Seller enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions.

SECTION 3.02. _Organization, Authority and Qualification of the Transferred
Subsidiaries_. Each Transferred Subsidiary has been duly incorporated or
formed, is a validly existing legal entity, is in good standing (or its local
equivalent) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
formation and has all necessary power and authority to own, operate or lease
the properties, rights and assets now owned, operated or leased by it and to
carry on the Business as it has been and is currently conducted.
Each Transferred Subsidiary is duly authorized, licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing (or its local equivalent) under the Laws in
each jurisdiction in which it, the properties, rights or assets owned or
leased by it or the operation of the Business by it makes such authorization,
licensing or qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing has not had and would not have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery by a Transferred
Subsidiary of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party, the
performance by such Transferred Subsidiary of its obligations thereunder and
the consummation by such Transferred Subsidiary of the transactions
contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate (or
other) action on the part of such Transferred Subsidiary. Each Ancillary
Agreement to which a Transferred Subsidiary is a party will be, when executed
as provided in this Agreement, (i) duly and validly executed and delivered by
such Transferred Subsidiary and, (ii) assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by each of the other parties hereto and thereto (other than
Parent or any Affiliates of Parent), a legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Transferred Subsidiary enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions. True and complete copies of the Governing Documents of each
Transferred Subsidiary have been made available to Buyer prior to the date
hereof.

 



37 SECTION 3.03. _Capitalization; Ownership of Interests_.

 

(a) _Section 3.03_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the
Transferred Subsidiaries and Minority Investment, and sets forth, for each
Transferred Subsidiary and Minority Investment, the name, type of entity,
jurisdiction and date of its incorporation, its authorized capital stock or
similar ownership interests, the number and type of its issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or similar ownership interests and the
owners thereof. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
similar ownership interests of each Transferred Subsidiary and the equity
interests of the Minority Investment owned by Parent or its Affiliates were
duly authorized for issuance and are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar
rights, and are owned directly by Parent or an Interest Seller,
as applicable, free and clear of all Encumbrances and free of any restriction
on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or similar ownership interests of each Transferred
Subsidiary and Minority Investment.

(b) Except for this Agreement, there are no options, warrants, calls,
subscriptions, convertible or exchangeable securities or other rights,
securities, or Contracts relating to the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock or similar ownership interests of any Transferred Subsidiary, or
obligating Parent, its Affiliates, any Transferred Subsidiary or any Seller
to issue, transfer or sell, or cause to be issued, transferred or sold, any
shares of capital stock or similar ownership interests of any Transferred
Subsidiary or Minority Investment or other equity security of any Transferred
Subsidiary or Minority Investment, or other security convertible into,
exchangeable for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase shares
of capital stock or other equity securities of any Transferred Subsidiary or
Minority Investment, or grant, extend or enter into any such Contract. There
are no outstanding contractual obligations of Parent or its Affiliates to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Interests or any other interest in
the Transferred Subsidiaries or Minority Investment. No shares of capital
stock or similar ownership interests of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries
are reserved for issuance for any purpose. There are no voting trusts,
proxies, or other agreements or understandings to which any Transferred
Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of any shares of capital
stock or similar ownership interest of any Transferred Subsidiary, nor is
there any voting trust, proxy or other agreement to which Parent or its
Affiliates is a party with respect to the voting of any shares of capital
stock or similar interest of any Minority Investment. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness issued by any Transferred Subsidiary
which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders
of such Transferred Subsidiaries are entitled to vote. No Transferred
Subsidiary holds, directly or indirectly, equity interests or capital stock
(or rights to acquire equity interests or capital stock) of any Person, and
no Purchased Assets include the equity interests or capital stock of any
Person.

 

(c) Each foreign Transferred Subsidiary is in compliance with all statutory
minimum capitalization requirements of applicable Law.

 

SECTION 3.04. _No Conflict_. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent
and each Seller of this Agreement and by Parent, each Seller and each
Transferred Subsidiary of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a

process, summarize and report financial information of the Business and there
has not been any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or

5.01(a)(xi)_).

the products currently being sold by or on behalf of the Business. The
Business is not subject to any current obligation or requirement arising under
any consent decree, untitled letter, warning letter, enforcement letter or
similar communication issued by or entered into with the FDA or any other

similar Law. The Business has not retained or employed debarred or
disqualified Persons and is not subject to FDAs Application Integrity Policy.

 

(d) Each of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business has in effect all
material Permits required by Law or any Governmental Authority for the
Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business to own, lease or operate its
properties, rights and other assets and to carry on its activities and
operations as currently conducted, including the sale and distribution of
products of the Business. All of such Permits are current and valid and in
full force and effect, and all currently marketed products that require a

that covers that product as currently manufactured and labeled, and no
suspension, restriction, cancellation or adverse modification of any material
Permit is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Sellers, threatened, and
to the Knowledge of Parent and Sellers, there is no basis for any
such suspension, restriction, cancellation or adverse modification. No
violation, default, Governmental Order or deficiency exists with respect to
any of such Permits.

 

SECTION 3.10. _Environmental Matters_. (a) The Business and the Transferred
Subsidiaries have during the past three (3) years complied (and, to the

Agreement Date, a complete and accurate list (in all material respects) of
all patents and applications therefor, registered Trademarks and applications

(other than Permitted Encumbrances). All Persons who created or invented
material Business Intellectual Property have assigned in writing to an Asset
Seller or Transferred Subsidiary all of their rights in same that did not vest
initially in such companies by operation of Law. No material Business
Intellectual Property that is proprietary software, used in the operation
of the Business, and has been licensed, conveyed or made available to third
parties uses, is derived from or interacts with "open source" or similar
software in a manner that would require the licensing or making available of
the source code version of such software. No material proprietary source code
used in the operation of the Business has been placed into escrow or is
subject to the right of current or contingent access by any third party.

 



42 (c) The Business as currently conducted does not materially infringe or
otherwise violate any third partys Intellectual Property rights (other than
patent rights) and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Sellers, the Business as
currently conducted does not materially infringe or otherwise violate any
third partys patent rights. There is no Action of infringement or violation
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Sellers, threatened in writing

years against the Business, the Business Intellectual Property or any
Transferred Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of Parent and Sellers, no third party
is infringing or otherwise violating the Business Intellectual Property. There

Asset Seller or a Transferred Subsidiary alleging infringement or other
violation of the Business Intellectual Property.

measures to protect the confidentiality of its trade secrets and Personal Data
and to prevent unauthorized access to the IT Assets, trade secrets, and
Personal Data, in each case relating to the Business, and there have been no
material outages or unauthorized uses of the IT Assets or misuses,
destruction, loss, or unauthorized access to, disclosure, use or modification

the obligation to notify any data subject to any other Person under applicable
Law.

of the Leased Real Property, and none of them has received or delivered

each Parent Plan, the material terms of such Parent Plan, and benefits to be
provided thereunder, are consistent with market practice for a multi-national
business in the applicable jurisdiction for such Parent Plan.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws. Each
Parent Plan and Subsidiary Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
or is maintained pursuant to a prototype, volume-submitted, or other pre-
approved plan and is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion or advisory
letter issued by the IRS. No event has occurred since the date of the most
recent determination, opinion, or advisory letter that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualification of such Parent Plan or
Subsidiary Plan. Neither Parent nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has, since
November 1, 2014, maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to

(i) all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Plan required by
law or by the terms of such Foreign Plan have been made, or, if applicable,
accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices;

(ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the
book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the Closing Date, with respect to all current or former
participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Foreign Plan and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause
such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations;
and

(iii) each Foreign Plan required to be registered has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with applicable Governmental Authorities.

 



45 (e) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in connection with any
other event(s)) could reasonably be expected to (i) except as provided in

bonus or similar compensation or benefits or any increase in severance,
retention, bonus or similar compensation or benefits as a result of any
termination of employment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any payment or funding of compensation or benefits under, or

contributions, by virtue of their employment having previously transferred to
the Business pursuant to the Transfer Regulations.

manner (taking into account any valid extension), and all such Tax Returns are
true, correct and complete in all material respects, and all Taxes shown to be
due thereon have been timely paid.

with regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of any Transferred Subsidiary or the
Purchased Assets. No Seller has received any written claim by a Taxation
Authority in a jurisdiction where a Transferred Subsidiary does not file
Tax Returns to the effect that that Transferred Subsidiary is or may be
subject to taxation in that jurisdiction, and no Seller has received any
written claim by a Taxation Authority in a jurisdiction alleging that Seller
has a duty to file Tax Returns and pay any Tax with respect to any Purchased
Asset (it being understood that a "nexus questionnaire" or similar inquiry by
a Taxation Authority shall not constitute a written claim described in this
representation).

 



46 (e) None of the Transferred Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
Contract for the sharing or indemnification of any Tax (including any advance
pricing agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with

arising in a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date, (iii) a prepaid amount received, or paid, prior to the Closing
Date, (iv) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
Law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date, (v) intercompany transactions
or any excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Section
1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax Law) or (vi) an election under Section 108(i) of the Code
(or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 

Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

SECTION 4.01. _Organization, Authority and Qualification_. Buyer is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Virginia and has all necessary corporate power and
authority to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is or will be a party, to carry out its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party, the performance by
Buyer of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by
Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of Buyer. This
Agreement has been, and 

 



52  upon their execution each of the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer is a
party will be, (a) duly and validly executed and delivered by Buyer, and, (b)
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other
parties hereto and thereto, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. 

SECTION 4.02. _No Conflict_. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a
party, do not and will not (a) conflict with or violate the Governing
Documents of Buyer, (b) assuming that all consents, waivers, approvals,
orders, authorizations and other actions described in  _Section 4.03_ have
been obtained, all filings and notifications have been made and any applicable
waiting period has expired or been terminated, conflict with or violate any
Law or Governmental Order applicable to Buyer, (c) conflict with, result in a
breach of or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a
default under, or require any consent, approval, or authorization under or
give rise to any right of termination, amendment, suspension,
revocation, acceleration or cancellation of, or loss of benefit under, any
Contract to which Buyer is party or by which its properties or assets are
bound, except with respect to clauses (b) and (c) of this _Section 4.02_, to
the extent any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences would not prevent or materially delay Buyers ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 4.03. _Governmental Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery
and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to
which it is or will be a party do not and will not require any consent,
approval, waiver, authorization or Permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except (a) applicable requirements of the HSR
Act and any foreign acquisition control or Competition Laws and (b) such other
consents, approvals, waivers, authorizations or permits, the failure of which
to obtain would not prevent or materially delay Buyers ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 4.04. _Brokers_. Except for fees payable to Lazard Freres and Co. LLC
and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, which fees will be
paid by Buyer, none of Buyer or any of its officers, directors or employees,
has employed any broker, finder or investment banker or incurred any
brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 4.05. _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to Buyers
Knowledge, threatened against Buyer, other than Actions that, if determined
adversely to Buyer, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay Buyers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 4.06. _Solvency_. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions to
Buyers obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_
of this Agreement (without giving effect to any Knowledge, materiality or
Seller Material Adverse Effect qualifiers) and that all material contingent
liabilities are disclosed therein and in the Seller Disclosure Schedule and
(iii) the estimates, projections or forecasts provided by Parent or its
Affiliates to Buyer prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith
on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, then immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer will not (a)

 



53  be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of
its debts is greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the
fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its
probable Liability on its existing debts as they mature), (b) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business, or (c) have
incurred debts or obligations beyond its ability to pay them in the ordinary
course of business as they become due.

SECTION 4.07. _Financing_. Buyer has delivered to Parent true and
complete copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement
Date, among Buyer and certain of its Affiliates and Bank of America, N.A. and
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have
agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Debt Commitment
Letter, to lend the amounts set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter for the
purposes of financing the transactions contemplated hereby and related fees
and expenses (the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter and the
related fee letter are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "
_Financing Agreements_." None of the Financing Agreements has been amended or
modified prior to the Agreement Date; and none of the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Agreements have been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect prior to the Agreement Date. As of the Agreement Date, the Financing
Agreements are in full force and effect and are the valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other
parties thereto, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and the availability of equitable remedies (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).
Except for fee letter(s) relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing
(complete copies of which have been provided to Parent, with only the fee
amounts and certain economic terms of the market flex (none of which would
adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) redacted),
as of the Agreement Date there are no side letters or other Contracts related
to the funding or investment, as applicable, of the Debt Financing other than
as expressly set forth in the Financing Agreements delivered to Parent prior
to the Agreement Date. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Financing Agreements that are payable by it
on or prior to the Agreement Date. The only conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the obligations of the lenders to fund the full
amount of Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter. As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Buyer or any direct investor in Buyer under any term, or a failure of
any condition, of the Financing Agreements or otherwise would be reasonably
likely to result in any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to
be unavailable. As of the Agreement Date, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions in _Sections 8.02(a)(i)_ , _8.02(a)(ii)_ and _8.02(a)(iii)_ , Buyer
has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any term or condition of the Financing Agreements required to be satisfied by
it. Based on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the proceeds from the
Debt Financing, together with the cash or cash equivalents otherwise
available to Buyer, will provide Buyer at the Closing with sufficient funds to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and otherwise satisfy all of
its obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Purchase
Price and all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred by Buyer in
connection therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of Buyer
under this Agreement are not contingent in any respect upon the funding of
amounts contemplated by the Debt Financing.

 



54 SECTION 4.08. _Restricted Securities_. Buyer is acquiring the Interests for
its own account, with the intention of holding the Interests for investment
and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part of the
Interests, and Buyer does not have any present intention of selling, granting
any participation in or otherwise distributing the Interests. Buyer
understands that the Interests have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, by reason of specific exemptions from the
registration provisions, which depend upon, among other things, the bona fide
nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Buyers representations as
expressed in this Agreement. Buyer understands that the Interests are
"restricted securities" under applicable United States federal and
state securities Laws and that, pursuant to such Laws, Buyer must hold the
Interests indefinitely unless they are registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") and qualified by state authorities or an
exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is available.

SECTION 4.09. _Investment Canada Act_. Buyer is a WTO Investor within the
meaning of the Investment Canada Act and is not a state-owned enterprise
within the meaning of the Investment Canada Act.

 

SECTION 4.10. _Interested Stockholder_. From the date that is three years
prior to the Agreement Date, none of Buyer or any of its "affiliates" or
"associates" is or has been an "interested stockholder" of Parent (as those
terms are defined in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law).

 

SECTION 4.11. _Independent Investigation; Exclusivity of Representations and
Warranties_. Buyer has conducted its own independent investigation, review
and analysis of the Business, and acknowledges that it has been provided
adequate access to the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and
records, and other documents and data of Parent and its Affiliates for
such purpose. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN
_ARTICLE III_ OF THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF PARENT, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES MAKE OR
HAVE MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF PARENT, ITS AFFILIATES
OR THE BUSINESS.

reflected in the Closing Statement, in each case without ongoing limits on the
conduct or operation of the Business, the Transferred Subsidiaries or the
Assets and which contains no admission of fault or wrongdoing on the part of
the Business or the Transferred Subsidiaries;

 

(xiii) enter into any new line of business other than the Business;

 

(xiv) fail to keep current and in full force and effect in all material
respects or fail to apply for or renew any material Permit or Registration
necessary for the operation of the Business as currently conducted;

(xv) accelerate or alter in any material respect practices and policies
relating to the rate of collection of accounts receivable or payment of
accounts payable; or

(xvi) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, it
is understood and agreed that Buyer shall not have the right to control or
direct the operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing.
Prior to the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall exercise, consistent
with the terms of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their
respective operations.

 



58 SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Between the Agreement
Date and the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates will (a) give Buyer and its
officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financial advisors, consultants and financing sources and other
Representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Representatives_ ") reasonable
access, upon reasonable notice and during Parents and its Affiliates normal
business hours, to the offices, facilities, Books, Records and Files of the
Business and to the Businesss executive officers, directors, agents,
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors and other
Representatives (collectively, the " _Business Representatives_ "), and (b)
furnish or make available to Buyer and the Buyer Representatives such
financial and operating data and such other information with respect to the
business and operations of the Business as Buyer or the Buyer Representatives
may from time to time reasonably request. Buyer and the Buyer Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as to minimize any
disruption to the Businesss business and not interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Business or otherwise cause any unreasonable
interference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing, without the
prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), neither Buyer nor any Buyer Representative shall contact
any employee, officer, director, independent contractor, supplier, client or
customer of Parent or its Affiliates in connection with any information or
matter regarding the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer or a Buyer
Representative may contact such Persons in the ordinary course of Buyers
business as long as Buyer or such Buyer Representative does not mention,
discuss or allude to the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may withhold (i) any document or information, the
disclosure of which would conflict with the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party in existence as of the date hereof, (ii)
information that, if disclosed, would waive an attorney-client or other
privilege or would constitute a waiver of rights as to attorney work product
or attorney-client privilege, or (iii) information, the disclosure of which
poses a material risk of violating applicable Law pursuant to advice of
counsel. If any material is withheld by Parent pursuant to the preceding
sentence, Parent shall inform Buyer as to the general nature of the material
being withheld and the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the
foregoing limitations would not apply. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section, materials provided to the other party or its counsel
may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Business, privileged communications or other competitively sensitive
information. Each party may also reasonably designate any material provided to
the other as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions (it
being understood that such materials and the information contained therein to
be provided only to the outside legal counsel of the receiving party and not
to be disclosed by such outside legal counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the receiving party without the prior written consent of the
party providing such materials). Except as otherwise agreed to by Parent, and
notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 2, 2017 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between Buyer and Parent shall apply to all information
furnished to Buyer or any Buyer Representative by any Business Representative
under this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
Buyers obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate at the
Closing.

 



59 SECTION 5.03. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, each of Buyer and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) cooperate with one another in determining which filings are
required to be made by each of them prior to the Closing with, and which
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required or reasonably
advisable to be obtained by each of them prior to the Closing from,
Governmental Authorities or other Persons in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, and (ii) subject to  _Section 5.03(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, assist one another in timely making all such filings and timely
seeking all such consents, approvals, permits, authorizations and waivers
required or reasonably advisable to be made and obtained by the others.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide any guarantees of obligations under
a Contract or Permit required by any Person or Governmental Authority as
a condition to granting such Persons or Governmental Authoritys consent,
approval, permit, authorization or waiver with respect to such Contract or
Permit. In addition, prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall each use,
and shall each cause their respective Affiliates to use, commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents for the assignment and
transfer of the IT Contracts and provision of the services under the
Transition Services Agreements, it being agreed that in connection with
obtaining such consents (i) Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for
one-half (1/2) of all costs and expenses owed to the counterparties of (x) the
IT Contracts and (y) any other Contracts for which consent is required to
provide the services under the Transition Services Agreements, and (ii)
neither party shall be obligated to make, or responsible to pay the cost of,
any unreasonable concession, alteration, modification, or amendment of, to,
or under any IT Contract or such other Contract (including increased prices,
fees, or volumes, term extensions, or entering into a new agreement for
additional services) in connection with obtaining such consents.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with obtaining
the consent of any Person (other than a Governmental Authority), no party
shall be obligated to offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to obtain any consent or approval required or reasonably advisable
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Contract (other than the IT Contracts or Contracts for which consent is
required to provide the services under the Transition Services Agreements, as
provided above); _provided_ , that, other than with respect to IT Contracts or
Contracts for which consent is required to provide the services under the
Transition Services Agreements, as provided above, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall commit to pay to any
third party whose consent or approval is being solicited any amount of cash or
other consideration or make any commitment or incur any Liability in
connection therewith, in each case to the extent it would be an Assumed
Liability. Prior to making any application to or filing with (such as
confidential information relating to valuation of the Business, competitively
sensitive information or privileged communications) any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement, Buyer and Parent shall provide
one another with drafts of such application or filing (excluding or, as
appropriate, restricting access to any confidential information included in
such application or filing) and afford one another a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such drafts. As promptly as practicable, Buyer and Parent shall
file or cause to be filed any filings required under any
applicable Competition Laws in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including filing the Notification and Report
Forms required pursuant to the HSR Act no later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Agreement Date, and using reasonable best efforts to file or
cause to be filed the applicable filings under the Competition Laws set forth
on _Section 5.03(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule no later than fifteen
(15) Business Days following the Agreement Date. Buyer shall bear the filing
fees of any required filing under the applicable Competition Laws.

 



60 (b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.03(a)_, each of Buyer and
Parent shall (and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and
representatives to) consult and fully cooperate with and provide assistance to
one another in seeking early termination of any waiting period under the HSR
Act or any foreign acquisition control or Competition Laws, if applicable, and
use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any Governmental Order that would restrain, prevent or
materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject
to the provisions of this _Section 5.03_, neither Buyer nor Parent shall
knowingly impede or delay the termination or expiration of any waiting period
under the HSR Act or any Competition Laws or enter into any agreement with the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice or any similar foreign Governmental Authority
responsible for overseeing acquisition control Laws or Competition Laws not to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written
consent of one another, and neither Buyer nor Parent, nor their respective
Affiliates, shall withdraw its initial filing under the HSR Act contemplated
by this _Section 5.03_, or any similar filing concerning acquisition control
Laws or Competition Laws, with the intent to refile such filing unless
the other party has consented in advance to such withdrawal and refiling.

(c) Each of Buyer and Parent shall (i) promptly notify one another of any
written or verbal communication to that party from any Governmental Authority
located in the United States or outside of the United States with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any application to or
filing with such Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement
and, subject to applicable Law, if practicable, permit one another to review
in advance or engage in consultation, as appropriate, concerning any proposed
substantive written or verbal communication with respect to such matters to
any such Governmental Authority and incorporate the other parties reasonable
comments, (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend, (iii) respond as fully and promptly as reasonably
practicable to any inquiries or requests for information or documents received
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the filings under the
HSR Act or other similar filings concerning acquisition control Laws or
Competition Laws related to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv)
furnish one another with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between such parties and their Affiliates and their respective
representatives on one hand, and any such Governmental Authority or its staff
on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section, materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted
to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business, privileged
communications or other competitively sensitive information. Each party may
also reasonably designate any material provided to the other as "Outside
Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions (it being understood that
such materials and the information contained therein to be provided only to
the outside legal counsel of the receiving party and not to be disclosed by
such outside legal counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
receiving party without the prior written consent of the party providing such
materials).

 



61 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
any administrative or judicial Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of
the HSR Act or any foreign acquisition control Laws or Competition Laws, or if
any Law or Governmental Order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by
a Governmental Authority that would make the transactions contemplated hereby
illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or
conduct its business in a specified manner, (ii) agree to sell, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business in a specified manner or
(iii) permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of
Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or conduct its business in a specified manner, and
(iv) contest and resist any such Action, in all of such cases of (i) through
(iv), as may be required to avoid the commencement of any such Action, or if
already commenced, to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Governmental Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and to have such Law or Governmental Order
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that neither Buyer nor its
Affiliates shall be required to take any action, or commit to take any action,
or agree to any condition or restriction, that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, Liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of
Buyer and its Affiliates as they would exist after the Closing, taken as a
whole. Parent shall not, without the written consent of Buyer, publicly or
before any Governmental Authority or other Person, offer, suggest, propose or
negotiate, and shall not commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, any sale, divestiture, disposition, prohibition
or limitation or other action of a type described in this _Section 5.03(d)_.

(e) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or agree
to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or
any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or
equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of
any Governmental Authority seeking or entering a Governmental Order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii)
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Governmental Order on
appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially delay or prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



62 SECTION 5.04. _Trademarks; Transition Period; Names; Website_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
retain the ownership of the trade name Avent and any Trademarks and domain
names that include the name Avent or Kimberly-Clark (or variations thereof),
all of which such domain names are set forth on _Section 5.04(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Seller Licensed Marks_ " and " _Seller
Licensed Domains_ ," respectively). Except as expressly provided in this
_Section 5.04_, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no right to use in any
way Seller Licensed Marks.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in no event later
than six (6) months after the Closing, Buyer shall cease to use and remove or
cover the Seller Licensed Marks from all signs, billboards, telephone
listings, stationery, office forms or other materials in any media of the
Business (" _Business Materials_ "). Buyer may use the Seller
Licensed Domains on the Internet for twelve (12) months after the Closing,
solely to redirect Internet users to websites using domain names other than
those containing the Seller Licensed Marks. The Parties shall cooperate to
facilitate such redirection during such time period, such as by creating a
shared landing page for the Seller Licensed Domains or otherwise directing
users to websites for the Business or the Medical Device Business. After such
time period, Seller shall have sole control of the home page for the Seller
Licensed Domains. Seller shall remain the registrant and administrative and
technical contact for the Seller Licensed Domains after the Closing, and each
Party shall have exclusive control over the websites of its business linked
to such domains during the shared time period.

(ii) Buyer shall cease the use of the Seller Licensed Marks on any packages
and labels of the products of the Business (" _Business Labels_ ") as promptly
as practicable after the Closing, but in any event before the end of the Sell-
Off Period. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Parent
hereby grants to Buyer and its Affiliates a nonexclusive, non-assignable,
worldwide and royalty-free license, right and privilege to use (A) the
Seller Licensed Marks and Seller Licensed Domains for the Sell-Off Period
applicable to a particular product of the Business in a particular
jurisdiction, solely on any Business Labels used by Buyer and its Affiliates
for such product in such jurisdiction; (B) the Seller Licensed Marks and
Seller Licensed Domains on the Business Materials for six (6) months after the
Closing; and (C) the Seller Licensed Domains as permitted in clause (i) above
for 12 months after the Closing.

(b) Solely for purposes of clarity, at the Closing, pursuant to certain of the
Bills of Sale, Buyer or its Affiliate is acquiring from Parent or its
Affiliates its and their worldwide right, title and interest in the trade name
Halyard and all Trademarks and domain names that include the name Halyard (or
variations thereof) (collectively, the " _Buyer Licensed Marks_ " and such
domain names, the " _Buyer Licensed Domains_ "), including those set forth on
_Section 5.04(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in no event later
than six (6) months after the Closing, Parent shall file to change its and
its Affiliates legal names and Parents stock ticker symbol to a name and
symbol that does not include the Buyer Licensed Marks or any Trademarks
confusingly similar thereto, and shall diligently prosecute such
changes until completion. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, but in no event later than the earlier of (A) nine (9) months after
the Closing Date and (B) ninety (90) days after the date Parent changes its
legal name, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cease to use and
remove or cover the Buyer Licensed Marks from all signs, billboards, telephone
listings, stationery, office forms or other materials in any media (" _Seller
Materials_ "), unless such use is

 



63  required by a Governmental Authority during the Registration Transition
Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the earlier of (A) nine (9)
months after the Closing Date and (B) three (3) months after the date Parent
changes its legal name (such earlier date, the " _Initial Transition Date_ "),
Parent and its Affiliates may (x) use the Buyer Licensed Marks on the websites
for the Medical Device Business that receive redirected traffic from the
shared landing pages below for the Buyer Licensed Domains, solely in a manner
consistent with past practice and traditional phase-out use; and (y) refer to
halyardhealth.com in Parents press releases and filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. From the Initial Transition Date until the end of the
Name Transition Period, at Parents request, Buyer shall display on
Buyers websites operating under any Buyer Licensed Domains that appear on
any Device Materials a redirect to websites using domain names other than the
Buyer Licensed Marks, to the extent necessary to enable Parent and its
Affiliates to comply with applicable Laws. The Parties shall create a shared
landing page for each of the Buyer Licensed Domains or cooperate to otherwise
facilitate direction of Internet users to websites for either the Business or
the Medical Device Business until the Initial Transition Date, after which
time, Buyer shall have sole control of the home pages for the Buyer Licensed
Domains. Buyer shall be the registrant and administrative and technical
contact for the Buyer Licensed Domains at all times after the Closing, and
each Party shall have exclusive control over the websites of its business
linked to the shared home pages of the Buyer Licensed Domains until the
Initial Transition Date.

 

(ii) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cease the use of the
Buyer Licensed Marks on any packages and labels of products of the Medical
Device Business or any other business of Parent or its Affiliates (" _Device
Materials_ ") as promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in any event
before the end of the Name Transition Period. Subject to the terms
and conditions contained herein, Buyer hereby grants to Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, a non-exclusive, non-assignable,
worldwide and royalty-free license, right and privilege to use the Buyer
Licensed Marks and Buyer Licensed Domains (A) for the Name Transition Period,
on any Device Materials distributed as of the Closing Date by Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and (B) until the deadline in _Section 5.04(b)(i)_, on the
Seller Materials, in each case solely in a manner consistent with past
practice and transitional phase-out use.

 

(c) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees
that Parent or its Affiliate is the owner of all right, title, and interest
in and to the Seller Licensed Marks, and all such right, title, and interest
shall remain with Parent and its Affiliates. All rights to Seller Licensed
Marks not expressly granted to Buyer or its Affiliates under this Agreement
shall remain the exclusive property of Parent and its Affiliates. Buyer shall
not (and shall ensure its Affiliates do not) otherwise contest, dispute, or
challenge the right, title, and interest of Parent and its Affiliates in and
to the Seller Licensed Marks. Buyer shall not (and shall ensure its
Affiliates do not) file applications to register any Trademarks or apply for
any domain names in any jurisdiction worldwide that are (i) confusingly
similar to any of the Seller Licensed Marks or (ii) consist of, in whole or
part, any of the Seller Licensed Marks. All goodwill and improved reputation
generated by Buyers or its Affiliates use of the Seller Licensed Marks shall
inure to the benefit of Parent. These provisions apply to Parent and its
Affiliates with respect to the Buyer Licensed Marks, _mutatis mutandis_.

 



64 (d) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Buyer shall make the necessary
filings in the applicable jurisdictions that are required to change the legal
name of each of the applicable Transferred Subsidiaries to a name that does
not include "Avent" and shall diligently prosecute such filings to completion.
Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall
make the necessary filings in the applicable jurisdictions to change the legal
name of each of the applicable Asset Sellers to a name that does not include
"Safeskin" and shall diligently prosecute such filings to completion.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates may use the
Seller Licensed Marks at all times after the Closing in a non-trademark
manner (i) as required by Law; (ii) for internal use only, on legal documents
and materials; and (iii) to describe the history of the Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Affiliates may use the Buyer
Licensed Marks at all times after the Closing in a non-trademark manner (i) as
required by Law; (ii) for internal use only, on legal documents and
materials; and (iii) to describe the history of Parent and its Affiliates.

(f) At Buyers request, for 180 days after the Closing Date, Parent will
display on all websites and social media venues referencing the Business owned
or controlled by Parent or its Affiliates a mutually-agreed statement about
the transactions contemplated hereby and a link to a website and venue
designated by Buyer.

(g) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent and/or Asset Sellers shall make
all filings and take all actions that are required to ensure that (i) all
Registered Intellectual Property is recorded at the applicable Governmental
Authority as exclusively owned by a Transferred Subsidiary, Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer, in each case as agreed to by the parties and (ii)
there are no outstanding chain of title issues with such Registered
Intellectual Property, and shall diligently prosecute all of such filings to
completion promptly after the Closing Date.

(h) Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) agrees that it shall not,
during the term of its license herein, directly or indirectly take or permit
any actions which will or may dilute the Seller Licensed Marks, tarnish or
bring into disrepute the reputation of or goodwill associated with the Seller
Licensed Marks or applicable licensor, or which will or may invalidate or
jeopardize any registration of the Seller Licensed Marks. Parent (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates) agrees that it shall not, during the term of its
license herein, directly or indirectly take or permit any actions which
will or may dilute the Buyer Licensed Marks, tarnish or bring into disrepute
the reputation of or goodwill associated with the Buyer Licensed Marks or
applicable licensor, or which will or may invalidate or jeopardize any
registration of the Buyer Licensed Marks. Each of Parent and Buyer (on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates) agrees that the nature and quality of all
products and services provided by such party pursuant to its license herein
shall conform to the historical standards, quality, style, and image of the
licensing party and any reasonable guidelines and standards as are provided in
writing from time to time by the licensing party.

 

(i) Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries), covenants and agrees that none of them will bring or threaten
to bring any Action against Buyer or its Affiliates alleging that their
current or future operation of the Business infringes any Intellectual
Property (other than Trademarks, which are governed by this _Section
5.04_) that is owned by Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and used in connection with the Business as of the Closing Date
(the " _Covenant IP_ "). Buyer and its 

 



65  Affiliates may extend the benefit of this covenant to its and their vendors,
service providers, distributors, customers and end users in connection with
their operation of the Business and may assign this covenant, in whole or in
part, to any successors to or acquirers of one or more businesses to which
this covenant relates. Any assignee or purchaser of the Covenant IP is
automatically bound to this _Section 5.04(i)_.

 

SECTION 5.05. _Further Action; Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.03_, each of Parent and Buyer shall (and each shall
cause each of its respective Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause to be
done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law and the
Contracts and Permits included in the Assets, and to execute and deliver such
documents and other papers and any other agreements, as may be necessary to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either inside or outside the
United States, including to effect the separation of the Business and the
Assets from other assets or other businesses of Parent and its Affiliates,
including, to the extent practicable, reasonable steps to divide Shared Assets
that are divisible.

 

(b) With respect to each Shared Contract that is an Excluded Asset, Parent
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the counterparty to such Shared Contract to enter into a new
contract (a " _Stand-Alone Contract_ "), on the best terms reasonably
available, with Buyer or its designee in order for Buyer or its designee
to receive the applicable benefits under a Stand-Alone Contract as were
provided under the applicable Shared Contract. With respect to each Shared
Contract that is a Purchased Asset, Buyer shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
counterparty to such Shared Contract to enter into a Stand-Alone Contract, on
the best terms reasonably available, with Parent or its designee in order for
Parent or its designee to receive the applicable benefits under a Stand-Alone
Contract as were provided under the applicable Shared Contract. The costs of
any fees or other payments to the counterparties under such Shared Contracts
that may be necessary in connection with entering into any Stand-Alone
Contract shall be borne by the party receiving the benefit of such Stand-Alone
Contract. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Shared Contract_ " means a
Contract between Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a
third Person, on the other hand, pursuant to which, immediately prior to the
Closing Date, both (i) the Business or a Transferred Subsidiary and (ii) the
Medical Device Business or Parent or its Affiliate (other than with respect
to the Business or a Transferred Subsidiary), received the benefits of
tangible or intangible goods and/or services.

(c) To the extent that (i) any Asset Sellers rights under the Purchased
Assets may not be assigned without the consent of another Person (including
any Governmental Authority, but excluding Parent and its Affiliates), which
consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing, or (ii) the attempted
assignment of any Asset Sellers rights under the Purchased Assets would be
ineffective or a violation of any Law or Governmental Order, then this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to transfer or assign the same.

 



66 (d) To the extent that any of the transfers, distributions, deliveries and the
assumptions required to be made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been so consummated at the
Closing pursuant to _Section 5.05(c)_, and subject to the terms of the
Ancillary Agreements to the extent addressed thereby, following the Closing
(i) Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
necessary consents to the transfer or assignment thereof (provided that
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party without the prior
written approval of Buyer to the extent it would be an Assumed Liability) and
(ii) the parties shall cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under
which Buyer or its Affiliates would, in compliance with applicable Laws and
the terms of any applicable Contract or Governmental Order, obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated
with such Purchased Asset in accordance with this Agreement, including
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer or its Affiliates, or
under which Parent would enforce for the benefit (and at the expense) of Buyer
or its Affiliates any and all of Parents or its Affiliates rights against a
third party (including any Governmental Authority) associated with such
Purchased Asset, and Seller and its Affiliates would promptly pay to Buyer or
its Affiliates when received all monies received by them under any such
Purchased Asset. Upon receiving the requisite third party consent thereto (or
if any transfer or assignment would no longer constitute a violation of any
applicable Law or the terms of any applicable Contract or Governmental Order),
the parties shall for no additional consideration effect the consummation of
the transfer of the applicable Purchased Asset as promptly thereafter as
reasonably practicable, including executing and delivering such further
instruments of transfer and taking such other actions as the parties may
reasonably request in order to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement or to
more effectively transfer to Buyer or confirm Buyers right, title to or
interest in, the Business and all of the Assets, to put Buyer in actual
possession and operating control thereof and to permit Buyer to exercise all
rights with respect thereto (including rights under Contracts, Permits and
other arrangements as to which the consent of any third party to the transfer
thereof shall not have previously been obtained). The provisions of _Section
5.05(c)_ and _Section 5.05(d)_ shall in no way limit the obligation of Parent
or the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement to seek such consents prior to the
Closing or excuse Parent or any Seller from responsibility for any breach of
any of its representations and warranties or covenants hereof. Following the
Closing, this _Section 5.05(d)_ shall not apply to consents of third parties
required for assignment of the IT Contracts or to provide services under the
Transition Services Agreements, which shall be governed by the Transition
Services Agreements.

 

(e) In the event that a party becomes aware that any assets, rights or
properties that properly constitute Assets were omitted from any portion of
_Section 2.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and not transferred to
Buyer at the Closing via a Transfer Agreement, then such party shall promptly
notify the other parties, and Parent shall promptly take all steps reasonably
necessary to modify the applicable schedule and to transfer and deliver any
and all of such Assets to Buyer without the payment by Buyer of any further
consideration therefor. In the event that a party becomes aware that any
assets that do not properly constitute Assets were included on any portion of
_Section 2.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and transferred to Buyer
at Closing (including by way of transfer of the Transferred Subsidiaries) via
a Transfer Agreement, then such party shall promptly notify the other
parties, and Buyer shall promptly take all steps reasonably necessary to
transfer and deliver any and all of such assets to Parent without the payment
by Parent of any further consideration therefor.

5.06_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule), between Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and
the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other hand, subject to the settlement of
Liabilities relating thereto pursuant to this _Section 5.06_. Within five (5)
Business Days after the Settlement Date, all intercompany receivables,
payables, loans and other Liabilities between Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and a Transferred
Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be paid (other than any Ancillary
Agreements or as set forth in  _Section 5.06_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule) with the result that there will not be any intercompany receivables,
payables, loans or other Liabilities between Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and a Transferred
Subsidiary, on the other hand, after such payment.

(b) Such payment shall be made in the manner described in _Section 2.05(f)_,
except that such payment shall not be considered an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for any purpose and shall not be subject to VAT.

 

SECTION 5.07. _Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, distribute or otherwise transfer from
the Transferred Subsidiaries to Parent any Excluded Assets, Excluded
Liabilities and other assets that are not Assets and take the actions
described in _Section 5.07_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule for
the purposes of transferring to certain Transferred Subsidiaries certain
Assets and Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the " _Restructuring_ ").
Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.01_ to the contrary, prior to or
after the Agreement Date and before the Closing, Parent shall be free to
distribute or otherwise transfer from the Transferred Subsidiaries to Parent
or any of its Affiliates any Parent Retained Intellectual Property. Parent
shall provide Buyer with all documentation relating to the Restructuring no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the execution of any documentation

opportunity to review and consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to all documentation and other matters
relating to such transfers.

 

SECTION 5.08. _Books, Records and Files_. Subject to Parent counsels
retention right in _Section 2.01(a)(x)(A)_ and the terms, if any, of the

deliver all Transferred Books and Records to Buyer or its Affiliates at the

to the extent relating to the Medical Device Business or Excluded Assets from
such Books, Records and Files.

 

SECTION 5.09. _Accounts Receivable that are Purchased Assets or Excluded

deliver promptly to Parent all cash, checks or other funds or property
received directly or indirectly by Buyer or any of its Affiliates with respect
to such receivables and other items. With respect to all accounts receivable
and other items that are Assets (and are not Excluded Assets), following the
Closing Parent agrees to deliver promptly to Buyer all cash, checks or other
funds or property received directly or indirectly by Parent or any of its
Affiliates with respect to such receivables and other items.

 



68 SECTION 5.10. _No-Shop_. Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
to, and shall cause its and their Representatives to, (i) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or any
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
terminate access by any Person to any physical or electronic data room or
other access to data of Parent and its Affiliates, in each case relating to or
in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) request any such Person
and its representatives to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning Parent and its Affiliates relating to, or in
connection with, an Acquisition Proposal. Until the earlier of the Closing or

shall, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
Affiliate, agent, intermediary or representative in his or her official or
personal capacity: (a) solicit, initiate or encourage submission of proposals
or offers from any Person relating to any sale by Parent or its Affiliates of
(x) a material amount of the business or assets of the Business, including the
Assets, whether by sale of assets, sale of equity, merger, liquidation or
otherwise, or (y) any equity interests in the Sellers (or any Person that is
required to be a Seller pursuant to _Section 5.19_) (an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "); (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise
respond to, cooperate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person
to make an Acquisition Proposal; or (c) enter into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. Parent
shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of learning of
the relevant information) notify Buyer if any Person makes any proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact with respect to any of the foregoing.

 

SECTION 5.11. _Financing Commitments_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and shall use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer to obtain the Debt Financing,
including, as promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date and receipt
from Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, delivering to the Lead Arranger
(as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter), the documents and information
required under the Debt Commitment Letter to commence the marketing period
under the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including any "flex" provisions) or on other terms that, in the
Buyers sole discretion, (A) would otherwise be permitted by _Section
5.11(b)_ and (B) would not reasonably be expected to materially delay or
adversely affect, in any material respect, the ability of Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at
or prior to the Closing and (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter. Buyer shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment
Letter or any ancillary letters referred to therein without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) adds any new
conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing or
amends, replaces, supplements or modifies any existing

 



69  conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, or impede or
materially delay the Debt Financing, (B) reduces (or has the effect of
reducing) the amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount
of fees to be paid or original issue discount in respect of the Debt Financing
(except as set forth in any flex provisions existing on the date hereof)) to
an amount that, together with other available cash or other funds of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, would on the Closing Date be less than the amount required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C) could
otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay
availability of the Debt Financing or (D) materially adversely affects the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter or
any Alternative Financing. In the event that the Debt Commitment Letter is
amended, replaced, supplemented or Alternative Financing is obtained, Buyer
shall comply with its covenants in this _Section 5.11(a)_ and _Section
5.11(b)_ with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or with respect to the Alternative Financing, if applicable, to
the same extent that Buyer would have been obligated to comply with respect to
the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be permitted
to amend, modify or supplement the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar entities who have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof on terms substantially similar
to those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter.

(b) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter for any reason and such portion is reasonably required to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby at or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall
promptly notify Parent and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event, alternative financing from alternative sources (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient (when taken together with other
available cash or other funds of Buyer and its Subsidiaries) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby with terms and conditions no less favorable,
taken as a whole, to Buyer (or its Affiliates) than the terms and conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and its and their respective Representatives to use reasonable
best efforts to provide such cooperation as is reasonably requested by Buyer
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any Alternative
Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not (1) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Parent and its Affiliates), (2)
require the board of directors of Parent to waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other cost or expense (in each case, on or prior to the Closing) that is not
reimbursed by Buyer, (3) require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Transferred Subsidiaries) to take any action that would violate any of
their organizational documents or any Laws or would result in a violation or
breach by the Parent of any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Subsidiaries), or default under, any contract or agreement to which such
Person is a party as of the date hereof, or (4) result in any officer or
director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any personal
liability), including by using reasonable best efforts to: (i) to the extent
customary and reasonable, participate in a reasonable number of meetings
(including meetings with prospective lenders), presentations, road shows,

 



70  drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, including using commercially
reasonable best efforts to coordinate direct contact between senior management
and the independent auditors of Asset Sellers, the Transferred Subsidiaries
and Parent on the one hand, and the actual and potential lenders, on the other
hand and sessions with rating agencies, at reasonable times and with
reasonable advance notice, (ii) facilitate the pledging of, and perfection of
security interests in, the Assets and the Interests, effective no earlier than
the Closing Date; provided that the delivery of any original stock
certificates and other certificated securities shall be delivered in
escrow pending release at the Closing, (iii) furnish to Buyer and its
financing sources as promptly as reasonably practicable the Required
Information, (iv) update any Required Information provided to Buyer as may be
necessary for such Required Information to remain Compliant and update any
Required Information as may be necessary so that the Required Information does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact with respect to the
Business or omit to state any material fact with respect to the Business
necessary to make the statements contained in such Required Information not
misleading in any material respect (after giving effect to all supplements and
updates thereto from time to time) in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, (v) providing upon the reasonable request of the Buyer and/or
Debt Financing sources such information reasonably deemed necessary to prepare
a confidential information memorandum (including a version that does not
include material non-public information) and other customary materials
reasonably required to complete the syndication or obtain the "Required
Consent" as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter, (vi) providing upon the
reasonable request of the Buyer and/or Debt Financing sources assistance in
obtaining customary auditor comfort letters and to provide consents for use of

filings required to be made by Buyer pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder) where financial information of the
Business is included, (vii) assist Buyer in the preparation of (A) customary
materials for rating agency and investor presentations (including "roadshow"
or investor meeting slides), registration statements, offering memoranda,
prospectuses, private placement memoranda (including under Rule 144A under
the Securities Act), and other customary marketing materials and (B)
definitive documentation for the Debt Financing, (viii) provide customary
authorization letters authorizing the distribution of information to
prospective lenders or investors and containing customary representations that
the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not include material
non-public information about Parent, the Transferred Subsidiaries or their
consolidated Subsidiaries or securities, (ix) cause directors and officers of
the Transferred Subsidiaries who will continue to hold such offices and
positions from and after the Closing Date to execute resolutions or consents
of the Transferred Subsidiaries as is otherwise necessary in connection with
the Debt Financing, (x) cooperate to facilitate the due diligence efforts of
Buyers financing sources relating to the Business, to the extent customary
and reasonable and not unreasonably interfering with the business of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, (xi) facilitate the delivery and execution of customary
guarantee and other definitive financing documents by the Transferred
Subsidiaries, including customary certificates, and facilitating legal
opinions and other documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer (provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, any obligations contained in such
documents shall be effective no earlier than as of the Closing), (xii)
facilitate the release of any Encumbrances on the Assets and the Interests and
the termination of all guarantees (if any) in connection therewith subject to
the occurrence of the Closing and (xiii) provide at least four (4) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, all documentation and other information as is
required

 



71  by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act to the extent requested by Buyer in
writing at least nine (9) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) none of
Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries at
and following the Closing) shall be required to pay any commitment or other
fee or incur any other Liability or obligation in connection with the Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing, (ii) no obligation of any Transferred
Subsidiary under any document, certificate or instrument executed pursuant to
this _Section 5.11(c)_ shall be effective until the Closing, (iii) none of
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be required to execute or deliver or
have any Liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related
document or any other agreement or document (including any certificates, legal
opinions or pledge or security documents) related to the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing, and (iv) other than the Required Information, no
financial statements shall be required to be furnished hereunder. Buyer shall
promptly, upon request by Parent, reimburse Parent for all reasonable and
invoiced out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred
by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the cooperation of
Parent and its Affiliates contemplated by this _Section 5.11(c)_ (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the cooperation of Parent and
its Affiliates with respect to any offering of debt securities that the Buyer
may elect to pursue to finance the transactions contemplated hereby) and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees and representatives from and against
any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred
by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (or
any Alternative Financing) (which shall be deemed to include any offering of
debt securities that the Buyer may elect to pursue to finance
the transactions contemplated hereby in addition to or lieu of the Debt
Financing) and any information used in connection therewith (other than
factual information provided in writing by Parent or its Affiliates
specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this _Section
5.11(c)_). The foregoing indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing
and any termination of this Agreement and shall not be subject to the
indemnification requirements in _Article X_. All non-public or other
confidential information provided by Parent or any Seller or its
Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyer will be
permitted to disclose such information to any financing sources or prospective
financing sources and other financial institutions and investors that may
become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters,
initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing
(and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such
Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties
thereto or other confidentiality obligations that are substantially similar
to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement or (ii) are subject to
customary confidentiality arrangements, or other confidentiality undertakings
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and of which Parent is a beneficiary.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in _Section
8.02(a)_ of this Agreement, as it applies to Parents and its affiliates
obligations under this  _Section 5.11_, shall be deemed satisfied unless (A)
Buyer has not obtained the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing on the
terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (B) Parents material breach
of its obligations under this _Section 5.11_ was a proximate cause of the
failure of Buyer to obtain the Debt Financing. Parent hereby consents to the
use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is reasonable
and customary and that is not reasonably likely to harm or disparage Parent or
its Subsidiaries in any respect.

 



72 (d) Buyer shall give Parent prompt written notice: (i) of any material breach
or default by any party to, or any condition not likely to be satisfied in,
the Debt Commitment Letter (or any Alternative Financing) or any definitive
document related to the Debt Financing of which Buyer becomes aware, (ii) of
any termination (or threat of termination) of the Debt Commitment Letter (or
commitments for Alternative Financing), (iii) if, for any reason, Buyer
believes in good faith that it is reasonably likely that it will not be able
to obtain all or any material portion of the Debt Financing in the amounts
contemplated by the Financing Agreements (or any Alternative Financing) and
that it is not reasonably likely that it will be able to obtain acceptable
Alternative Financing. Buyer shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and
consummate the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing). In the event that
the Debt Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented or modified
in accordance with this _Section 5.11_ or Alternative Financing is obtained
in accordance with this _Section 5.11_, Buyer shall promptly notify Parent of
such event. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Debt Financing
or any Alternative Financing is not a condition precedent to Buyers
obligations under this Agreement, including Buyers obligations pursuant to
_Article II_.

 

SECTION 5.12. _Bulk Transfer Act_. Subject to _Article VII_ , the parties
hereby waive compliance with any state or provincial "Bulk Transfer Act" or
"Bulk Sales Act," to the extent applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent and Sellers shall indemnify Buyer for any Losses arising out of
the failure to comply with such Laws as an Excluded Liability.

SECTION 5.13. _Assignment of NDAs_. Parent agrees not to, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives not to, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, release any Person from, or waive any provision of,
any confidentiality, non-solicitation or similar agreements between Parent,
its Affiliates or its or their Representatives, on the one hand, and any
other Person, on the other hand, that were entered into or in connection with
or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or that otherwise relate to the
Business or the Transferred Subsidiaries. At the Closing, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, to
the extent assignable in accordance with the terms thereof, assign, grant and
convey to Buyer all of the rights under such confidentiality, non-
solicitation or similar agreements to the extent related to the Business,
including the right to enforce all the terms of such agreements to the extent
related to the Business. At Buyers request, Parent or its Affiliates will
use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce on Buyers behalf (with Buyer
solely responsible for all fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith)
any such rights that are not assignable. At the Closing, Parent shall deliver
to Buyer complete and correct copies of all such agreements.

SECTION 5.14.  _Insurance_. Following the Closing, Parent shall, at Buyers
request, make a claim for coverage by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates under any occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policy
maintained or arranged by Parent, the Transferred Subsidiaries or their
Affiliates that provide Parent, the Transferred Subsidiaries or their
Affiliates with insurance coverage with respect to claims in respect of loss
to any Assets or Assumed Liabilities arising from facts, events or
circumstances that occurred at or prior to the Closing to

 



73  the extent such coverage is available under such insurance policies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall exclusively bear (and neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to repay or reimburse
Buyer for) the amount of any deductibles associated with claims made under
such policies. Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, take no action
to exclude or remove any Assets, Transferred Subsidiaries, Assumed
Liabilities or the Business from coverage under any such insurance coverages.
Parent and Buyer shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts in pursuing
the collection of all such insurance proceeds in respect of such claims made
and each of Parent and Buyer shall provide the other with all reasonably
required information necessary for Parent or its Affiliate to make such
claims. Any proceeds received by Parent or its Affiliates in respect of any
such claim shall be promptly turned over by Parent or such Affiliate to Buyer
or the applicable Transferred Subsidiary (calculated net of reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Parent or such of its Affiliates in procuring
such recovery) and until such time such proceeds will be held by Parent or
such of its Affiliates in trust for Buyer or the applicable Transferred
Subsidiaries.

 

SECTION 5.15. _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) For a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (i) request, induce or
attempt to influence any distributor, supplier, licensor or customer of goods
or services of the Business to curtail, cancel or refrain from maintaining or
increasing the amount or type of business such distributor, supplier,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.15_ shall not operate to
prevent or restrict the direct or indirect acquisition by Parent or any of its
Affiliates (through acquisition, merger or other strategic transaction) of an
interest in any Person that engages in the Restricted Business if (i) such
Person does not have consolidated total annual gross revenues derived from the
Restricted Business (at the time of the completion of such investment or
acquisition) in excess of 15% of the consolidated total annual gross revenue
of the Business for the fiscal year ending prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
Parents and Affiliates voting ownership interest in such Person does not
exceed 10% in the aggregate.

(b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit or induce to leave the employment of Buyer or its Subsidiaries any (i)
Continuing Employee employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (ii)
other employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates who works for the Business
(and, during the period prior to the Closing, Parent shall not and shall cause
its Affiliates not to solicit or induce any individual who would be a
Continuing Employee to leave the employment of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or
to not accept offers of employment by Buyer or its Subsidiaries); _provided_ ,
that, the foregoing shall not apply to the solicitation or hiring of (x) any
such individuals whose employment has been terminated by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or (y) any such individuals who respond to general solicitations of
employment not specifically directed toward employees of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

 



74 (c) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit
or induce to leave the employment of Parent or its Subsidiaries any employee
of Parent or its Subsidiaries with whom Buyer had contact or who became known
to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (and during
the period prior to the applicable Transfer Date, except as provided by
_Section 6.02_, Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to solicit
or induce any such employee to leave the employment of Parent or its
Subsidiaries); _provided_ that, the foregoing shall not apply to the
solicitation or hiring of (x) any such individuals whose employment has been
terminated by Parent or any of its Affiliates or (y) any such individuals who
respond to general solicitations of employment not specifically directed
toward employees of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 

(d) Following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their Representatives, to keep confidential and not disclose any
Business Confidential Information. Parent further agrees that, except in
compliance with this _Section 5.15(d)_, it shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives not to, access, release, or
use, or permit to be accessed, released, or used, in each case, in
contravention of this _Section 5.15(d)_, any Business Confidential
Information other than such access, release, and use as is necessary for
Parent, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives (who shall be

required to maintain as confidential any Business Confidential Information (i)

protective order or other appropriate remedy is not obtained, the disclosing
party shall furnish only that portion of such information which, in the
opinion of its counsel, it is legally compelled to disclose and shall
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be afforded any such information so disclosed or
(ii) that Parent deems reasonably necessary or advisable to use or disclose
in the course of defending or otherwise satisfying the obligations of the
Excluded Liabilities, it being agreed that the disclosing party will use its
reasonable best efforts to provide reasonable advance notice (to the
extent practicable) to Buyer and will exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
afforded any such information so disclosed. " _Business Confidential

Transferred Subsidiaries or the Assumed Liabilities.

 



75 (e) Following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its
and their Representatives, to keep confidential and not disclose any Parent
Confidential Information. Buyer further agrees that, except in compliance with
this _Section 5.15(e)_, it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its

foregoing, such Persons shall not be required to maintain as confidential any
Parent Confidential Information (i) that becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of disclosure by such Person or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives in breach hereof, or that is required to be

compelled to disclose and shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded any
such information so disclosed or (ii) that Buyer deems reasonably necessary

(f) It is the intention of the parties that if any restriction or covenant
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform such restriction or covenant to provide
for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and
other provisions as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law.
Each of Buyer and Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.15_ are an essential element of this Agreement and
that, but for the agreement of each of Buyer and Parent in this _Section
5.15_, the other party would not have entered into this Agreement. Each of
Parent and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the undertakings of Buyer and
Parent in this _Section 5.15_ constitute an independent covenant of such
party and shall not be affected by the performance or nonperformance by any
party hereto of any other term or provision of this Agreement. Each of Parent
and Buyer acknowledges that it has consulted with its own counsel with regard
to this _Section 5.15_ and, after such consultation, agrees that the

privilege (including the attorney-client privilege) or (z) comply with any
contractual confidentiality obligations.

SECTION 5.18. _Audited Financial Statements / Regulation S-X Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall provide Buyer with the unaudited
combined balance sheet of the Business and related year-to-date unaudited
statements of income and cash flows for each fiscal quarter ended after the
close of the most recently ended fiscal year and at least 45 days prior
to the Closing Date (other than the fourth fiscal quarter) (it being
understood that unaudited combined balance sheets for the Business and the
related combined statements of income and cash flows for the fiscal quarters
ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 shall not be required), _provided_
that, if the Closing Date occurs within forty-five (45) days after the most
recently completed fiscal quarter of Parent, Parent shall have until the date
that is forty-five (45) days after the end of such fiscal quarter to deliver
such unaudited financial statements to Buyer. If the Closing Date occurs on or
after March 1, 2018, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Businesss auditors to complete and issue as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date the combined audited balance sheet of the Business
as of December 31, 2017, and related audited statements of income, changes in
equity and cash flows for the year then ended. Buyer shall promptly, upon
request by Parent, reimburse Parent or its Affiliate for (i) the cost of
preparing any audited year-end financial statements, and (ii) the cost
of preparing any unaudited financial statements for any quarterly period
ended after September 30, 2017, in each case to the extent such financial
statements are required by this _Section 5.18(a)_ or are otherwise required

Financial Statements except to the extent otherwise required by changes in
GAAP, (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Business (excluding the Medical Device Business) as of the dates

liabilities, the results of the operations, changes in equity (with respect to
audited financial statements) and cash flows of the Business (excluding the
Medical Device Business) for the periods then ended and (iv) be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated, except that that unaudited financial statements may include
condensed footnote disclosure and may be subject to normal and recurring year-
end adjustments, including income tax-related accruals and disclosures.

 



78 (c) Without limiting the obligations set forth in _Section 5.18(a)_ or 
_(b)_ above or in _Section 5.16_, from the Agreement Date and continuing
through the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall, from time to
time, upon reasonable advance notice from Buyer, provide (i) Buyer and its
Representatives with access to such financial and other information pertaining
to the Business for the period of Parents and its Affiliates ownership and
operation of the Business, to the extent in Parents or its Affiliates
possession or control (or to the extent Parent or its Affiliates could obtain
such information without unreasonable effort or expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall promptly, upon Parents request,
reimburse Parent or its Affiliate for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses paid for such provision), that is relevant and reasonably necessary,
in the reasonable opinion of Buyer, to enable Buyer to prepare financial
statements in compliance with the requirements of any or all of (A) Rule 3-05
of Regulation S-X of the SEC, and enable Buyers outside, third-party
accountants to audit such information, (B) any other rule issued by the SEC
and applicable to Buyer or its Affiliates and (C) any registration statement,
schedule, proxy statement, report or disclosure statement filed with the SEC
by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates and (ii) reasonable assistance to
Buyer and its outside, third-party accountants in completing audits and the
preparation of such financial statements. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, if requested by Buyer (x) Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, deliver a customary representation letter in such form as is
reasonably required by Buyers outside, third-party accountants, with such
facts and assumptions as reasonably determined by such accountants in order to
make such certificate accurate, signed by the individual(s) responsible for
Parents or such of its Affiliates financial reporting, as prescribed by
generally accepted auditing standards promulgated by the Auditing Standards
Division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which
representation letter may be required to assist such accountants in rendering
an opinion on such financial statements in order to comply with clauses
(i)(A), (i)(B) and (i)(C) above and (y) to the extent that Parents or its
Affiliates financial statements have previously been audited, Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the auditor of Parents and its
Affiliates financial statements to provide its consent to the inclusion of
its report, without exception or qualification, with respect to such audited
financial statements, to provide to Buyer or its Affiliates or the
underwriters or initial purchasers in any financing with appropriate comfort
letters in accordance with the American Institute of Public Accountants
professional standards and to participate in due diligence sessions
customarily conducted in connection with the provision of comfort letters.

SECTION 5.19.  _Asset Sellers_. To the extent that any of the Purchased
Assets are under the control of any of Parents Affiliates who are not Sellers
hereunder, Parent shall cause such Affiliates to become party to this
Agreement as an Asset Seller by executing a counterpart to this Agreement or
a joinder hereto in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and
will otherwise cause such Affiliates to promptly take such legal action as may
be necessary to consummate the transfer to Buyer or its designees of such
Purchased Assets in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_
that the execution by the Parent Indian Subsidiary of the India Purchase
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.22_ shall satisfy the obligations with
respect to the Parent Indian Subsidiary under this _Section 5.19_. Parent
shall update _Section 1.01_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule on or before
the Closing Date to the extent that such other Affiliates of Parent are
identified as owning Purchased Assets.

 



79 SECTION 5.20. _Notification of Certain Events_. Prior to the Closing, Parent
and Buyer shall promptly notify the other of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent such consent is not
already set forth on _Section 5.03(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;

 

(b) any notice or other communication from a Material Customer or Material
Supplier or any counterparty to a Material Contract that effects or threatens
to effect any cancellation, non-renewal or other termination of such Material
Contract or business relationship that, in each case, is material to the
Business;

 

(c) upon such partys Knowledge thereof, the occurrence of any Seller Material
Adverse Effect or any event, development, circumstance, occurrence, change or
effect that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay Buyers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

 

(d) upon such partys Knowledge thereof, any inaccuracy of such partys
representation or warranty in this Agreement or breach of failure of such
party to comply with any covenant hereunder at any time during the term hereof
that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in _Article
VIII_ not to be satisfied;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that any notification pursuant to this _Section
5.20_ shall not affect a Partys obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless the events or occurrences giving rise to
such notification would otherwise cause a failure in one of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_ or give rise to a right of termination pursuant to
_Article IX_.

SECTION 5.21. _Business Guarantees_. Buyer recognizes that Parent and certain
of its Affiliates have provided credit support to the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to guarantees, letters of
credit, bonds, sureties and other credit support or assurances provided by
Parent or its Affiliates in support of any Asset or Assumed Liability (the "
_Business Guarantees_ ") and that Parent may enter into additional Business
Guarantees after the Agreement Date in the ordinary course of business. Buyer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the respective
beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, on or
before the Closing Date, valid and binding written releases of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, from any Liability, whether arising before, on
or after the Closing Date, under the Business Guarantees set forth on _Section
5.21_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which release shall be effective as
of the Closing, including, as applicable, by providing substitute guarantees,
furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow agreements, posting surety or
performance bonds or making other arrangements as the beneficiary may
reasonably request. If any Business Guarantee (whether or not set forth on
_Section 5.21_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) has not been released as of
the Closing Date, then Buyer shall continue to use its commercially reasonable
efforts after the Closing to cause as promptly as possible the complete
and unconditional release of Parent and its Affiliates under such Business
Guarantee. Buyer shall, and hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing for any amounts
required to be paid under 

 



80  any Business Guarantees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this
_Section 5.21_, references to "Closing" or "Closing Date" in respect of
Specified OUS Assets or Specified OUS Liabilities shall instead refer to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the India Purchase Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.22. _India Purchase Agreement_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof, Buyer shall form a Subsidiary organized under the
laws of India (the " _Buyer Indian Subsidiary_ "). Following the formation of
the Buyer Indian Subsidiary and prior to the Closing, (a) Buyer shall cause
the Buyer Indian Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Parent Indian
Subsidiary a counterpart to the India Purchase Agreement, and (b) Parent shall
cause the Parent Indian Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Buyer Indian
Subsidiary a counterpart to the India Purchase Agreement. Buyer and Parent
shall take such actions as necessary to cause the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the India Purchase Agreement to not occur prior
to the Closing, and to cause the termination of the India Purchase Agreement
immediately following any termination hereof. Buyer and Parent agree to cause
the Buyer Indian Subsidiary and the Parent Indian Subsidiary, respectively, to
comply with the terms of the India Purchase Agreement following its execution
and delivery.

 

SECTION 5.23. _Buyer Subsidiaries_. Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to form before the Closing all
non-United States Persons it will need in order to take ownership of the
Purchased Assets in accordance with applicable Law.

 

SECTION 5.24. _System Automation_. Buyer and Seller agree to work together in
good faith to achieve the objective set forth on _ Section 5.24_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule and, in furtherance but not in limitation thereof,
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take the actions set
forth on _Section 5.24_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

SECTION 5.25. _Transition Services Agreements Schedules_.

 

(a) Between the Agreement Date and the Closing, Buyer and Parent shall
negotiate in good faith to finalize the terms of the Transition Services
Agreement (Non-IT Services) set forth on _Exhibit E-1_ hereto, and the
Transition Services Agreement (IT Services) set forth on _Exhibit E-2_ hereto
(collectively, the " _Transition Services Agreements_ "), and the schedules of
services to be provided pursuant to each of the Transition Services
Agreements. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the respective
Transition Services Agreements, Buyer and Parent agree that it is their mutual
intent that each of Parent, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
provide certain transition services (the " _Transition Services_ ") that (i)
if provided to Buyer or its Affiliates, have been provided by or through
Parent or its Affiliates to the Business or the Transferred Subsidiaries in
the twelve (12) months prior to the Agreement Date and that will be
reasonably necessary to continue to operate the Business after the Closing as
it is currently conducted, or (ii) if provided to Parent or its Affiliates,
have been provided by or through the Purchased Assets or a Transferred
Subsidiary to the business of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the
Business) in the twelve (12) months prior to the Agreement Date. Buyer and
Parent agree that determination of the Transition Services will be determined
with regard to (i) the reasonable ability of Buyer or Parent and their
respective Affiliates, as applicable, to provide such Transition Services
using their internal resources (to the extent applicable), (ii) the reasonable
availability of replacement services (and time and cost

 



81  required to secure and implement replacement services), and (iii) any
material disruption to Buyers or Parents respective businesses in providing
such Transition Services. Transition Services shall be provided on the basis
of Parents and its Affiliates cost for such services plus a reasonable mark-
up to be mutually agreed by Buyer and Parent.

 

(b) Each of Buyer and Parent shall appoint one individual who shall serve as
the contact person for the purpose of negotiating the terms of the Transition
Services Agreements and the schedules of services to the Transition Services
Agreements, which initial contact persons are set forth on _Section 5.25(b)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule under the heading "TSA Contact Persons". To
the extent that the exact terms of the Transition Services Agreements, the
Transition Services, their duration or pricing cannot be determined by a
working group of the appropriate persons and such contact persons within
sixty (60) days after the Agreement Date, either Parent or Buyer may initiate
a process under which the individuals set forth on _Section 5.25(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule under the heading "Contract Representatives"
(the " _Contract Representatives_ ") would meet in person or by telephone to
discuss resolution of the discrete points referred to them for a period of ten
(10) days in an attempt to reach a joint resolution.

 

(c) To the extent that the Contract Representatives are unable to resolve any
of the terms of the Transition Services Agreements, the scope of the
Transition Services, duration or pricing within such ten (10) day period, the
determination of such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration
conducted by a single arbitrator with relevant experience in transactions
comparable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and similar
transition services, which arbitration shall be conducted in New York City
under the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association;  _provided_ that if Buyer and Parent cannot
agree on an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the end of such ten (10)
day period, each of Buyer and Parent shall nominate a single representative
with such qualifications within five (5) days of the end of such fifteen (15)
day period and those two nominated representatives shall be required, within a
further ten (10) day period, to select an arbitrator with such qualifications
to preside over the arbitration and make the determination. Such arbitration
may occur before or after the Closing, and the Closing would not be delayed in
the event of any dispute over the Transition Services, regardless of whether a
dispute resolution has commenced;  _provided_ , that any such arbitrator
would be required to resolve such dispute within a forty-five (45) day period
following his or her appointment. In resolving any dispute, the arbitrator
shall take into account the parties intent regarding the Transition Services
set forth in _Section 5.25(a)_ above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
dispute between Buyer and Parent pertains to duration, pricing or other issues
not impacting the scope of the Transition Services to be provided, then each
of Buyer and Parent shall provide the requested Transition Services on and
after the Closing Date while such dispute is being resolved pursuant to
arbitration at the price previously determined, unless the pricing is in
dispute, in which case each of Buyer and Parent shall promptly pay the amount
required to be paid by it for such Transition Services for such period once
finally determined. Similarly, if the dispute pertains to the scope of the
Transition Services to be provided, then while such dispute is being resolved
pursuant to arbitration, (i) Parent shall provide all Transition Services that
are reasonably required by Buyer and its Affiliates to continue to operate
the Business on and after the Closing Date as conducted on the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) Buyer shall provide all Transition Services that are
reasonably required by Parent and its Affiliates to continue to operate the
business of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Business) on and after
the Closing Date as conducted on the date of this Agreement.

 



82 SECTION 5.26. _Distribution Agreements and Supply Agreement_ s. Between the
Agreement Date and the Closing, Buyer and Parent shall negotiate in good
faith the forms of Distribution Agreements and Supply Agreements, which forms
of agreements shall include those terms set forth on _Section 5.26_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules under the headings "Distribution Agreements" and
"Supply Agreements," respectively. Each of Buyer and Parent shall appoint one
individual who shall serve as the contact person for the purpose of
negotiating the Distribution Agreements and Supply Agreements. To the extent
that the forms of Distribution Agreements and Supply Agreements cannot be
determined by a working group of the appropriate persons and such contact
persons within sixty (60) days after the Agreement Date, either Parent or
Buyer may initiate a process under which the Contract Representatives would
meet in person or by telephone to discuss resolution of the discrete points
referred to them for a period of ten (10) days in an attempt to reach a joint
resolution. To the extent that the Contract Representatives are unable to
resolve any of the points referred to them within such ten (10) day period,
the determination of such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration
conducted by a single arbitrator with relevant experience in transactions
comparable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and similar
distribution or supply services, as applicable, which arbitration shall be
conducted in New York City under the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association; _provided_ that if
Buyer and Parent cannot agree on an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after
the end of such ten (10) day period, each of Buyer and Parent shall nominate
a single representative with such qualifications within five (5) days of the
end of such fifteen (15) day period and those two nominated representatives
shall be required, within a further ten (10) day period, to select an
arbitrator with such qualifications to preside over the arbitration and make
the determination. Such arbitration may occur before or after the Closing,
and, notwithstanding  _Section 8.02(b)_ and _Section 8.03(b)_, the Closing
would not be delayed in the event of any dispute over final forms of
Distribution Agreements and Supply Agreements, regardless of whether a dispute
resolution has commenced;  _provided_ , that any such arbitrator would be
required to resolve such dispute within a forty-five (45) day period following
his or her appointment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the dispute between
Buyer and Parent pertains to duration, pricing or other issues not impacting
the scope of the Distribution Agreements and Supply Agreements, then each of
Buyer and Parent shall provide the requested services or products thereunder
on and after the Closing Date while such dispute is being resolved pursuant
to arbitration at the price previously determined, unless the pricing is in
dispute, in which case each of Buyer and Parent shall promptly pay the amount
required to be paid by it for such services or products for such period once
finally determined. Similarly, if the dispute pertains to the scope of the
distribution services or products to be provided, then while such dispute is
being resolved pursuant to arbitration, (i) Parent shall provide
all distribution services, and provide all products contemplated to be
provided by it pursuant to the Supply Agreements, in a manner consistent with
those provided to the Business as of the Agreement Date, and (ii) Buyer shall
provide all products contemplated to be provided by it pursuant to the Supply
Agreements in a manner consistent with those provided to the other businesses
of Parent and its Affiliates as of the Agreement Date.

Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business Employees (as defined in _Section
6.02(a)_ below) regardless of the country in which such employees work, unless
a country-specific section is contained in _Appendix VI_ , in which case such
country-specific section shall apply, in addition to this _Article VI_, with
respect to all employees of the Transferred Subsidiaries and all
Business Employees in the applicable country. To the extent there is any
conflict between the provisions of this _Article VI_ and the provisions of
_Appendix VI_ , the provisions of _Appendix VI_ shall govern with respect to
employees in the applicable country. _Appendix VI_ is incorporated herein by
reference.

SECTION 6.01. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the lesser of (i) a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing
and (ii) the period following the Closing until December 31, 2018, with
respect to the employees of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business
Employees not employed by a Transferred Subsidiary who accept employment
offers from Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant to  _Section 6.02(a)_ or
whose employment is automatically transferred to the Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to the Transfer Regulations as set forth in _Section 6.02(c)_, and
in each case commences employment on the applicable Transfer Date (together,
the " _Continuing Employees_ "), Buyer or its Affiliates shall continue to
employ and provide employee benefits, base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, and target cash incentive opportunities, target long-term
incentive opportunities and severance to the Continuing Employees that in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee benefits, base salary
or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and target cash incentive opportunities,
target long-term incentive opportunities and severance provided to the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the applicable Transfer Date for
each such Continuing Employee; provided that Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not be obliged to offer continuing participation in any defined benefit
retirement plan unless required by the terms of an applicable collective
bargaining agreement, the Transfer Regulations or otherwise by Law; _provided_
, that nothing herein shall preclude Buyer or its Affiliates from terminating
the employment of any employee at any time on or following the applicable
Transfer Date.

(b) For all purposes, including with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employees will
participate after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with Parent or any of its
Affiliates (or service credited by Parent or any of its Affiliates), including
for vesting and eligibility purposes, but excluding benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan. Buyer shall also give credit to Continuing
Employees for their respective amounts of accrued paid time off under Parents
or any of its Affiliates paid time off plan, and Buyer will be responsible
for all of the obligations for accumulated amounts of the Continuing
Employees under Parents or any of its Affiliates paid time off plan.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such crediting of service
shall be required to the extent it would result in the duplication
of benefits.

 



84 (c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Buyer in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
waive (unless prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of the applicable
plan) all limitations as to pre-existing conditions and exclusions with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each such
employee to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did
not apply to such employee under the welfare plans maintained by Parent and
its Affiliates prior to the applicable Transfer Date of such employee (or at
the close of any subsequent period during which the benefits of such plan
maintained by Parent and its Affiliates are extended to employees of Buyer
and its Affiliates after the Closing pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreements) and (ii) provide (unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the
terms of such welfare plan) each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid under the welfare plans maintained by Parent and
its Affiliates prior to the Closing (or at the close of any subsequent period
during which the benefits of such plan maintained by Parent and its
Affiliates are extended to employees of Buyer and its Affiliates after the
Closing pursuant to the Transition Services Agreements) in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan.

(d) Prior to but effective as of the Closing Date, Parent will take such
action as it determines may be necessary or appropriate to cause each
Transferred Subsidiary to cease to maintain or participate in each Parent
Plan. Following the applicable Transfer Date, each Continuing Employee shall
be permitted to elect to take distribution (subject to applicable Law) of his
or her vested accounts under Parents tax-qualified defined contribution plan
or plans and, if such Continuing Employees so elect, to roll them over,
directly or otherwise, in accordance with applicable Law, to an individual
retirement account or to one or more defined contribution retirement plans
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code established or maintained by Buyer
or a Transferred Subsidiary (the " _Buyer Defined Contribution Plans_ ").
Buyer and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to facilitate the direct rollover
of distributions, including loan balances, due the Continuing Employees to
the Buyer Defined Contribution Plans where elected by Continuing Employees.

its Affiliates set forth on _Section 6.02(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure

Employees transferring at the applicable Transfer Date at least thirty (30)
days prior to such Transfer Date, which shall specify each such employees
name, title, work location, expected date of transfer, wage grade or pay

to determine each persons service credited for each purpose, status as
salaried or hourly employee, exempt or non-exempt status, employees current
status and reason code if employee is inactive, service dates for purposes
of vesting and eligibility to participate in any Employee Benefit Plan, and
shall also exclude any individual previously listed as a Business Employee
whose employment has terminated and include any employee hired to replace any
such terminated employee consistent with _Section 5.01(a)_. Each party shall
(subject to applicable privacy Law) use reasonable commercial efforts to
timely provide the other with all such information as the requesting party may
reasonably require to discharge its obligations under this _ARTICLE VI_. All
Business Employees (other

 



85  than Business Employees to be transferred at a Delayed Transfer Date) shall

offer of employment shall be made with a commencement date of the date that
such employee actively returns to work in accordance with the applicable leave
policy within 12 months of the Closing Date and if such Inactive
Business Employee does not so return within 12 months, then the offer shall
expire and such employee shall not become a Continuing Employee, as long as
such expired offer conforms with applicable Law). All such offers of
employment shall comply with the provisions of this _Article VI_ to the
extent and for the period then applicable and be subject to only such standard
employment requirements and forms as Buyer and Parent may mutually approve.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Buyer shall work in good faith to
identify and agree on those Business Employees to whom Transfer Regulations
are expected to apply in accordance with applicable local Law as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with applicable
local Law. To the extent that Transfer Regulations apply to a Business
Employee (an " _Automatic Transferring Business Employee_ "), the parties
shall comply with the provisions of Part A (Automatic Transfers) of _Appendix
VI_. In the event that Parent and Buyer agree to proceed on the basis that
Transfer Regulations do not apply to any Business Employee in a country
identified in Part A (Automatic Transfers) of _Appendix VI_ , the provisions
of _Section 6.02(b)_ shall apply to such Business Employee, subject to any
applicable Law.

 

(d) In the event that any person other than a Business Employee claims that
the Transfer Regulations operate to transfer such persons employment to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have the option
to treat such person as if he or she was a Business Employee and employ such
person pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in which case Parent and its
Affiliates shall have no Liability to Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to
such claim and such person shall for all other purposes of this Agreement be
treated as a Business Employee. If, in the event of such a claim by such a
person, Buyer and Affiliates choose not to treat such person as a Business
Employee, Parent shall, notwithstanding _Section 5.15(b)_, have the right to
offer employment to such person, and Parent shall be responsible for any
amounts payable to such person as a result of such claim, so long as Buyer
gives written notice to Parent of any such claim (giving so far as practicable
an estimate of the amount and details of the claim) within six (6) weeks
after becoming aware of such claim.

 



86 (e) Following entry into this Agreement, Parent shall and shall cause each
Asset Seller and each Transferred Subsidiary to comply with all applicable
requirements and obligations to provide any information required under the
Transfer Regulations to Buyer and its Affiliates, and to inform, consult or
otherwise notify any Continuing Employees or Employee Representatives in
relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether required
pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement, the Transfer Regulations or
other applicable Law.

 

(f) Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to comply with all applicable
requirements and obligations to provide any information required under the
Transfer Regulations to the Parent, the applicable Asset Seller or its
applicable Affiliate, and to inform, consult or otherwise notify the
Continuing Employees or Employee Representatives and any of Buyers and its
Affiliates employees or Employee Representatives in relation to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether required pursuant to any
collective bargaining agreement, the Transfer Regulations or other applicable
Law.

 

(g) Effective as of the applicable Transfer Date, Buyer shall assume or retain
all obligations of Parent and its Affiliates for the accrued unused vacation
with respect to Continuing Employees transferring at such Transfer Date,
provided that from the applicable Transfer Date through December 31, 2018 such
Continuing Employees shall be entitled to use such vacation in
accordance with the vacation policy of the applicable Transferred Subsidiary
or Asset Seller. To the extent that applicable Law requires that a Business
Employee be paid out for any accrued, unused vacation as a result of the
termination of such Business Employees employment with Parent or one of its
Affiliates under this Agreement, Parent shall be responsible for such
payments.

(h) Without limiting _Section 2.02(b)_, (i) Parent and its Affiliates shall
be solely liable for any claims for welfare benefits that are incurred by or
with respect to any Continuing Employee and his or her beneficiaries or
dependents under a Parent Plan, and (ii) Buyer shall be solely liable for any
claims for welfare benefits that are incurred by or with respect to any
Continuing Employee and his or her beneficiaries or dependents under a
Subsidiary Plan. For purposes of the foregoing, the following claims and
liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (x) life, accidental
death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon
the death, disability or accident giving rise to such benefits; (y) hospital-
provided health, dental, prescription drug or other benefits, which become
payable with respect to any hospital confinement, upon commencement of such
confinement; and (z) medical, dental, and vision, when the services are
rendered, the supplies are provided or prescribed medication is acquired by
the participant, and not when the condition arose.

 

(i) In the event that a Business Employee who has received an offer of
employment from Buyer or any of its Affiliates that is consistent
with Buyers obligations under _Section 6.01(a_) and applicable Law does not
become a Continuing Employee or accepts such offer but a severance payment is
required by Applicable Law upon termination of employment 

 



87  with the applicable Seller, and a severance payment is required by Parents
or any of its Affiliates severance policies or applicable Law to such
Business Employee, Parent shall be responsible for all severance amounts paid
or payable to such employee. Subject to _Section 6.02(j)_, to the extent
Buyer does not offer employment to a Business Employee that is consistent with
Buyers obligations under this _ ARTICLE VI_ , then Buyer shall be
responsible for all amounts payable to such employee.

(j) In the event that any Automatic Transferring Business Employee objects to
or refuses the transfer of their employment to Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
Parent shall be responsible for all severance and other amounts paid or
payable to such employee arising from continuing employment with Parent or
its Affiliates or termination of such employment, but excluding any amounts
that constitute Employment Related Liabilities deducted from the Purchase
Price as Indebtedness.

 

(k) For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing Date, the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall have no liability or
obligation (and Parent shall assume and retain all such liability and
obligation) with respect to current or former employees of the Transferred
Subsidiaries and Business Employees, in each case who do not become Continuing
Employees, provided that Buyer offers employment to such employees consistent
with Buyers obligations under this _ARTICLE VI_. Any Employment Related
Liabilities in respect of Continuing Employees with a Delayed Transfer Date
shall be paid by Parent or its Affiliate to Buyer or its Affiliate within
ninety (90) days following the applicable Transfer Date.

(l) Parent shall provide notice and an opportunity to exercise all
outstanding equity and equity-based awards of Continuing Employees prior to
the Closing (or their respective termination of employment with Parent and its
Affiliates, if later), but only to the extent then vested. There shall be no
acceleration of any outstanding equity or equity-based awards of Continuing
Employees prior to the Closing relating to or as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(m) Parent shall, within ninety (90) days following the applicable Transfer
Date, pay to each Continuing Employee who remains an employee of Buyer or one
its Affiliates through the date on which such payment is made, an amount in
cash equal to the intrinsic value (calculated as of immediately prior to such
Transfer Date) of that portion of any equity and equity-based awards that (i)
Parent and its Affiliates granted to such Continuing Employee in 2015, (ii)
remain outstanding and unvested immediately prior to such Transfer Date, (iii)
originally were scheduled to vest in 2018 pursuant to the terms and
conditions of such awards, and (iv) are forfeited, lapsed or otherwise
terminated relating to or as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _2015 Equity Awards_ "). Parent shall, within ninety (90) days
following the applicable Transfer Date, pay to each Continuing Employee who
remains an employee of Buyer or one its Affiliates through the date on which
such payment is made, an amount in cash equal to the intrinsic value
(calculated as of immediately prior to such Transfer Date) of that portion of
any equity and equity-based awards that (i) Parent and its Affiliates granted
to such Continuing Employee between the Agreement Date and the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of Buyer, (ii) remain outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to such Transfer Date, and (iii) are forfeited,
lapsed or otherwise terminated relating to or as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Interim Period Equity Awards_ "). Prior to the
applicable Transfer Date, Parent and Buyer shall work in good faith to
identify and agree on the intrinsic value of the 2015 Equity Awards and
Interim Period Equity Awards as of immediately prior to the such
Transfer Date.

 



88 (n) Buyer shall, within ninety (90) days following the applicable Transfer
Date, issue to each Continuing Employee transferring at such Transfer Date
one or more equity or equity-based awards relating to Buyer common stock that
in the aggregate have a grant date value substantially similar to the
intrinsic value (calculated as of immediately prior to such Transfer Date) of
the equity and equity-based awards, other than the 2015 Equity Awards and
Interim Period Equity Awards, that (i) Parent and its Affiliates granted to
such Continuing Employee prior to such Transfer Date, (ii) remain outstanding
and unvested immediately prior to such Transfer Date, and (iii) are forfeited,
lapsed or otherwise terminated relating to or as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Forfeited Equity Awards_ "); provided, that the
terms and conditions of such replacement awards (including the vesting
conditions) need not be the same as the Forfeited Equity Awards, and nothing
herein shall preclude Buyer or its Affiliates from terminating the employment
of any employee at any time on or following the applicable Transfer Date.
Prior to the applicable Transfer Date, Parent and Buyer shall work in good
faith to identify and agree on the intrinsic value of the Forfeited Equity
Awards as of immediately prior to such Transfer Date, as well as the method
of determining the grant date value of the replacement awards issued by Buyer
with respect thereto.

 

(o) Neither Parent and its Affiliates, on the one hand, nor Buyer and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall take any action without the other
partys consent to induce any Business Employee to reject an offer of
employment pursuant to _Section 6.01(b)_ or to object or refuse to the
automatic transfer of such persons employment to Buyer or its Affiliates.

 

SECTION 6.03. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This _Article VI_ shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this
Agreement, and nothing in this _Article VI_ , express or implied, shall confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this _Article VI_, including any rights a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement; _provided_ that Buyers Affiliates shall be
express third party beneficiaries of this _Article VI_. Nothing contained in
this _Article VI_ , express or implied (a) shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (b) shall
alter or limit the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, subject to
_Section 6.01_, or (c) shall create any rights in any employee of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates with respect to continued employment for any specified
period of any kind or nature whatsoever.

ARTICLE VII

 

TAXES

SECTION 7.01.  _Apportionment_. With respect to any Tax Return for any
Straddle Period, each party will, to the extent permitted by Law, elect to
treat the Closing Date, as the last day of the taxable year or period and will
apportion any Taxes arising out of or relating to a Straddle Period to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based upon a

 



89  "closing-of-the-books" immediately prior to the opening of business on the
Closing Date. In any case where applicable Law does not permit the parties
hereto to treat the Closing Date, as the last day of the taxable year or
period, any Taxes arising out of or relating to a Straddle Period or the
Purchased Assets will be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
Post-Closing Tax Period based on a closing of the books consistent with the
preceding sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that real and personal property
taxes and similar taxes and taxes based on net worth, capital, intangibles, or
similar items, shall be allocated on a per diem basis.

 

SECTION 7.02. _Tax Return Filing and Amendment_.

 

(a) Parent will prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns of each Transferred Subsidiary with respect to all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent such Tax Returns have not been filed
prior to the Closing, and Parent will timely pay, or cause to be paid, all
Taxes shown as due thereon. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing of such Tax Returns, Parent shall provide Buyer with a copy of
such draft Tax Returns, shall provide Buyer at least ten (10) days for its
review, and shall reflect any reasonable comments of Buyer delivered prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Returns. Buyer will prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of each Transferred
Subsidiary with respect to any Straddle Period to the extent such Tax Returns
have not been filed prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer will timely pay, or
cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as due thereon; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 7.02_ shall affect the rights of Buyer
to indemnification under _Section 10.02(d)_. Buyer shall deliver, at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (taking into account extensions) for
the filing of each such Tax Return for any Straddle Period in the case of
income taxes, and at least five (5) days prior to the due date (taking into
account extensions) for the filing of each such Tax Return for any Straddle
Period in the case of non-income taxes, to Parent a statement setting forth
the amount of Tax for which Parent is responsible pursuant to _Section
10.02(d))_ and a copy of such proposed Tax Return. Parent shall have the right
to review such proposed Tax Return and the statement for at least ten (10)
days prior to the filing of such Tax Return. Parent and Buyer agree to consult
and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such
Tax Return and statement and mutually consent to the filing of such
Tax Return. Parent shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, of the Tax shown on
the Tax Return for which Parent is responsible pursuant to _Section 10.02(d)_
unless and to the extent that Buyers failure to comply with its obligations
under this _Section 7.02(a)_ with respect to the preparation and review of a
Tax Return adversely affects Parent (for the avoidance of doubt, the amount so
payable by Parent shall be determined by taking into account any prior
estimated or other payments of the applicable Taxes and any amounts included
in the calculation of the Net Working Capital and Indebtedness) no later than
one (1) day before the due date (taking into account extensions) of the
applicable Tax Return, and any such payment shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price under _Section 10.06_. Neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall file any amended Tax Returns for any periods for or in
respect of any Transferred Subsidiary with respect to which Parent is
obligated to prepare, or cause to be prepared, the original such Tax Returns
pursuant to this _Section 7.02(a)_ or for which Parent has a right of review
and consent pursuant to this _Section 7.02(a)_ without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 



90 (b) If a dispute arises following the review of any Tax Return for a Straddle
Period by either party pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_, and such dispute is
not resolved by the parties within ten (10) days prior to the due date of such
Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions of time), such
dispute will be settled by an internationally recognized independent
accounting firm mutually appointed by the Buyer and Parent (" _CPA Firm_ "),
which shall submit its final determination within seven (7) days. The CPA
Firms determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto. Any and all costs arising from, and expenses incurred in connection
with, the CPA Firm for its services rendered pursuant to this _Section
7.02(b)_ shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other,
in inverse proportion as each shall prevail on the dollar amounts of such
disputed items so submitted to the CPA Firm as provided in this _Section
7.02(b)_. Following the CPA Firm determination, the party responsible for
filing the applicable Tax Returns shall file or cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries to file those Tax Returns on or prior to the applicable due date.
In the event the CPA Firm has not made a final determination by the date that
is three (3) days before the date on which such Tax Return is required to be
filed (including any available extensions), then the party responsible for
filing the Tax Return pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ shall timely file it as
it shall determine in good faith, taking into account the deliberations to
date and Parent shall pay the Buyer or the Taxation Authority, as applicable,
the amount that Parent has calculated in good faith to be due and owing by it
in accordance with  _Section 7.02(a)_. Within five (5) days following
resolution of the dispute by the CPA Firm, any amounts determined to be due
upon final resolution of the dispute (including interest and penalties with
respect to any underpayment of Tax shown on the Tax Return as filed compared
to the Tax shown on the Tax Return prepared in accordance with the CPA Firms
determination), taking into account amounts already paid under this subsection
(b), shall be promptly paid by the relevant party to the other party and,
where applicable, the party responsible for filing such Tax Returns shall file
amended Tax Returns.

 

(c) Buyer or its Affiliates shall not be permitted to file an amended Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for any Transferred Subsidiary without
the prior written consent of Parent.

SECTION 7.03. _Refunds_. Parent or one of its Affiliates shall be entitled to
retain or, to the extent actually received by or otherwise available to Buyer
or its Affiliates, receive prompt payment from Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries) of, any refund or any credit with
respect to Taxes ((i) including refunds arising by reason of amended Tax
Returns filed after the Closing Date, or otherwise, but (ii) excluding refunds
of Taxes withheld from payments to third parties that are required to be paid
over to such third parties, any refunds or credits with respect to prepaid
Taxes with respect to Employment Related Liabilities taken into account in
Indebtedness and any Taxes taken into account in Net Working Capital) with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period relating to the Transferred
Subsidiaries, Parent or any Asset Sellers, except to the extent that such
refund was reflected as an asset in the calculation of Closing Working Capital
as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.05_. Buyer shall be entitled to
retain or, to the extent actually received by Parent or its Affiliates,
receive prompt payment from Parent or any of its Affiliates of, any refund or
credit with respect to Taxes (including refunds arising by reason of amended
Tax Returns filed after the Closing, or otherwise) with respect to any Post-
Closing Tax Period relating to the Transferred Subsidiaries. Any refunds or
credits of Taxes with respect to Straddle Periods shall be apportioned
between Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Post-Closing Tax Periods pursuant to the
principles set forth in _Section 7.01_.

 



91 SECTION 7.04. _Resolution of Tax Controversies_. If a claim shall be made by
any Taxation Authority that might result in an indemnity payment to the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates in respect of a breach of a representation or
warranty contained in _Section 3.15_ or pursuant to _Section 10.02(d)_,
Buyer shall promptly notify Parent of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no delay on the part of Buyer in notifying Parent will relieve Parent
from any obligation under _Section 10.02_, except to the extent such delay
actually and materially prejudices Parent. In the event that a Taxation
Authority determines a deficiency in any Tax, the party ultimately responsible
for such Tax under this Agreement, whether by indemnity or otherwise, shall
have authority to determine whether to dispute such deficiency determination
and to control the prosecution or settlement of such dispute; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to Straddle Periods, Buyer shall control the
dispute and Parent shall have the right to consent to any proposed settlement
thereof, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
The provisions of this _Section 7.04_ shall be applied in lieu of the
provisions of _Section 10.05_ where applicable.

 

SECTION 7.05. _Tax Cooperation_. Each of the parties and their Affiliates
shall provide the other party with such information and records and make such
of its officers, directors, employees and agents available as may reasonably
be requested by such other party in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return or any audit or other proceeding that relates to the
Transferred Subsidiaries or the Purchased Assets.

SECTION 7.06. _Conveyance Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary (except with respect to VAT as provided in _Section
7.08_), all transfer, documentary, recording, sales, use, registration, stamp
and other similar taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes,
but excluding any Taxes based on or attributable to income or capital gains)
together with any notarial and registry fees and recording costs imposed by
any Taxation Authority or other Governmental Authority in connection with the
transfer of the Interests and the Purchased Assets hereunder (" _Conveyance
Taxes_ ") shall be borne by 50% by Buyer or one of its Affiliates and 50% by
Parent or one of its Affiliates (not including a Transferred Subsidiary). To
the extent that one party claims any exemptions from any Conveyance Taxes (it
being understood that each party shall claim any such exemptions available to
it), such party shall provide to the other party the appropriate exemption
certificates. The parties and their respective Affiliates will cooperate in
timely preparing and filing all Tax Returns and obtaining all exemptions that
may be required to comply with Law relating to Conveyance Taxes.

 

SECTION 7.07. _Section 338(h)(10)_. Each of Buyer and Parent, or their
respective Affiliate, agrees to execute any and all documents, forms and Tax
Returns required to make an election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code,
including Form 8023, with respect to the transfer of an Interest in a
Transferred Subsidiary that is a domestic corporation for purposes of the
Code and to file such Tax Returns consistent with the Final Allocation.

 



92 SECTION 7.08. _VAT_.

 

(a) The amount of any payment for a supply of goods or services or the value
of any supply made or deemed to have been made pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to the transfer of the Purchased Assets will be exclusive of any
VAT properly chargeable on the supply, and the amount of the VAT will be borne
by Buyer or one of its Affiliates, notwithstanding anything contrary
under applicable Law, in addition to any payment due under this Agreement at
the time the supply is made. In the event that any VAT is chargeable or
imposed upon Parent or one of its Affiliates, Parent or one of its Affiliates
will issue a valid VAT invoice that complies with formal and other
requirements under applicable Law. Upon receipt thereof, Buyer will, or will
cause one of its Affiliates to, promptly remit to Parent or one of its
Affiliates the VAT amount specified in such VAT invoice, in addition to the
payment for the transfer of the Purchased Assets.

(b) Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Parent that prior to the Closing,
each entity (whether Buyer or an Affiliate) acquiring Purchased Assets, or (if
relevant) assuming the Assumed Liabilities, the supply of which, but for being
outside the scope of VAT as a transfer of a going concern, would for VAT
purposes be treated as made in any jurisdiction (the " _Relevant
Jurisdiction_ ") will, if required under applicable Law in order for the
acquisition to be treated as being outside the scope of VAT as a transfer of a
going concern, be registered for VAT in such Relevant Jurisdiction and on or
before the Closing, Buyer will provide Parent with the VAT registration number
of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate with respect to such Relevant
Jurisdiction or other evidence of such valid VAT registration for such
Relevant Jurisdiction and shall as soon as is practical after the Closing,
provide Parent with a copy of a certificate of VAT registration (if
applicable) for each such Buyer or designated Affiliate of Buyer in a
Relevant Jurisdiction, valid as at Closing Date. In addition, Buyer shall
provide Parent prior to the Closing, with such other information or
confirmations as Parent or one of its Affiliates may reasonably request in
considering whether the sale of any of the Purchased Assets should properly
be characterized as a transfer of a going concern (including confirmation by
Buyer or its Affiliates it is intended that the relevant Purchased Assets will
be used to carry on the same kind of business as the relevant Asset Seller).

(c) If the transfer of the Purchased Assets fails to qualify, in whole or in
part, as a transfer of a going concern and, as a result, VAT is chargeable or
imposed upon Parent or one of its Affiliates in respect of the supply of all
or any part of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement:

 

(i) Parent will, or will cause one of its Affiliates to, issue a valid VAT
invoice that complies with formal and other requirements under applicable Law
and, upon receipt thereof, Buyer will, or will cause one of its Affiliates to,
promptly remit to Parent or one of its Affiliates the VAT amount specified in
such VAT invoice; and

 

(ii) if such failure to qualify, in whole or in part, as a transfer of a going
concern is solely attributable to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, Buyer will
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates against any Liability
for fines, surcharges, interest and/or penalties in respect of such VAT amount
arising to Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 

(d) In the event that: (i) an amount of VAT is payable under the terms of this
Agreement and the consideration as stated on the relevant VAT invoice in
respect of such amount of VAT differs from the actual consideration for the
relevant supply for VAT purposes (which will include where the Purchase Price
is adjusted in accordance with this Agreement, where the allocation
of consideration to any Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities is amended

 



93  or where no VAT invoice was actually issued), or (ii) where a Taxation
Authority determines in writing that a supply by Parent or one of its
Affiliates in respect of which Buyer or one of its Affiliates has paid VAT
should properly be characterized as a transfer of a going concern, the parties
agree to cooperate in good faith to correct the respective invoices/VAT
returns and make any required payments or repayments of amounts in respect of
VAT.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION 

SECTION 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing in the following circumstances:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and Buyer;

 

(b) by either Parent or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have occurred by July
31, 2018 (the " _Expiration Date_ "); provided, however, that if on the
initial Expiration Date the condition set forth in _Section 8.01(b)_ is not
satisfied but all the other conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_
are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to those conditions being capable
of being satisfied), then Buyer or Parent may, by providing written notice to
the other prior to 5:00 p.m. New York time on such initial Expiration Date,
extend the Expiration Date to October 31, 2018 in which case the Expiration
Date shall be deemed for all purposes to be such later date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section
9.01(b)_ shall not be available to (i) Parent, if its or any Sellers failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the principal
cause of, or shall have principally resulted in, the failure of the Closing
to occur on or prior to such date or (ii) Buyer, if its failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement shall have been the principal cause of, or
shall have principally resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on
or prior to such date;

(c) by either Parent or Buyer, if any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction has issued a Governmental Order (that has not been vacated,
withdrawn or overturned) permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and such
Governmental Order shall have become final and nonappealable;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.01(c)_ shall not be available (i) to Parent if it or any Seller
has failed to perform its obligations under  _Section 5.03_ or (ii) to Buyer
if it has failed to perform its obligations under _Section 5.03_;

(d) by Buyer, if Parent or any Seller has breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement or any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue
after the Agreement Date, and such breach or untruth (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ and (ii) is
incapable of being cured by the Expiration Date or, if curable, is not cured
within the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Business Days after the giving of
written notice by Buyer of such breach or untruth and (y) the Expiration Date
(a " _Parent Terminating Breach_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall
have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(d)_
if there is an uncured Buyer Terminating Breach at the time Buyer seeks to
terminate for a Parent Terminating Breach; and

 



96 (e) by Parent, if Buyer has breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement or any such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue after the Agreement Date,
and such breach or untruth (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in  _Section 8.03(a)_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the
Expiration Date or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (x) twenty
(20) Business Days after the giving of written notice by Parent of such breach
or untruth and (y) the Expiration Date (a " _Buyer Terminating Breach_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have no right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(e)_ if there is an uncured
Parent Terminating Breach at the time it seeks to terminate for a Buyer
Terminating Breach; provided, further that, if (A) all of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing
Date, but that would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such
termination), and (B) Buyer fails to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with _Section 2.06_, such failure shall constitute a
Buyer Terminating Breach (provided that the twenty (20) Business Day cure
applicable to a Buyer Terminating Breach shall be reduced to three (3)
Business Days).

 

SECTION 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement and abandonment of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
_Section 9.01_, this Agreement shall immediately become null and void and
have no effect, without any Liability on the part of any party hereto or its
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, Affiliates, debt financing
sources (including the Lenders or their respective Representatives or
Affiliates) and agents; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) termination of this
Agreement shall be without prejudice to any rights any party hereto may have
under this Agreement against any other party hereto for any Willful Breach of
this Agreement prior to termination and (ii) the provisions of the last
sentence of _Section 5.02_ (Preservation of Confidentiality Agreement), the

representation, warranty or covenant or other agreement set forth in this

party with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking of such act
or failure to take such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause
a breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

SECTION 10.01. _Survival_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement survive the Closing and shall terminate on, and no Indemnifying
Party will be liable for any Losses hereunder with respect to a breach of such
representations and warranties unless a written notice for indemnification in
accordance with _Section 10.05_ is given by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party with respect thereto prior to, the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing indefinitely, and (ii)
the indemnity for Indemnified Taxes pursuant to _Section 10.02(d)_ and the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.10_ and _Section 3.15_ shall
survive the Closing and shall terminate on, and such notice for
indemnification must be provided prior to, the sixtieth (60th) day following
the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the underlying
matter.

 



97 (b) All of the covenants or other agreements of the parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive until the earlier of the performance of such covenant
or agreement or until the termination of the applicable survival period
referenced in the following sentence, unless and only to the extent that non-
compliance with such covenants or agreements is waived in writing by the party
entitled to such performance. No claim for a breach of a covenant or other
agreement set forth in this Agreement that (i) by its nature is required to
be performed at or prior to the Closing may be made or brought by either Buyer
or Parent after the six (6)-month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) by
its nature is required to be performed after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing
Covenants_ ") may be made or brought by either Buyer or Parent unless notice
for indemnification is given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party prior to thirty (30) days following the last date on which each such
Post-Closing Covenant was required to be performed.

(c) The right to indemnification with respect to any claim for which notice
has been properly and timely given in accordance with this _Section 10.01_
and _Section 10.05_ shall survive until the resolution of such claim.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations pursuant to
_Sections 10.02(c)_ , _10.02(e)_ , _10.03(c)_ and  _10.03(d)_ represent the
parties intention to allocate certain Liabilities and are not claims for
breach in any respect, thus the parties intend for such provisions to survive
indefinitely.

 

SECTION 10.02. _Indemnification by Parent_. Subject to the limitation set
forth in _Section 10.04_ below, from and after the Closing, Buyer and its
Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by Parent and Sellers, jointly and severally,
for and against all damages, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments,
Taxes and penalties (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
actually suffered or incurred by them (hereinafter, " _Losses_ ") if and to
the extent arising out of, by reason of or relating to:

(a) the failure of any representation or warranty of Parent or Sellers set
forth herein to be true and correct when made;

(b) any failure by Parent to perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant set
forth herein;

(c) the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities;

 

(d) any liability for Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, including all liability for Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of which a
Transferred Subsidiary is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date,
including pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local or foreign law, and any Taxes attributable to the Restructuring
or the transactions contemplated by _Section 5.06(b)_, except to the extent
taken into account in Net Working Capital or Indebtedness (" _Indemnified
Taxes_ ");

 



98 (e) events occurring on or after the Closing Date arising out of or related to
the ownership or operation of the business of Parent and its Affiliates
(other than the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, which shall not
include the Specified OUS Assets or Specified OUS Liabilities until the
"Closing" (as defined in the India Purchase Agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this _Section 10.02(e)_ shall not apply to, and no
indemnification shall be provided pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ for, Losses
arising out of or related to any commercial relationship between Parent and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other,
or Losses arising out of or related to the Transition Services Agreements,
Supply Agreements or the Distribution Agreements; and

 

(f) the matters set forth in _Section 10.02(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

 

SECTION 10.03. _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing, Parent
and its Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_
") shall be indemnified and held harmless by Buyer for and against any and all
Losses if and to the extent arising out of, by reason of or relating to:

(a) the failure of any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth herein
(or in any certificate delivered hereunder) to be true and correct when made;

(b) any failure by Buyer to perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant set
forth herein;

 

(c) events occurring on or after the Closing arising out of or related to the
Business (other than (i) the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities and (ii)
until the "Closing" (as defined in the India Purchase Agreement), the
Specified OUS Assets or Specified OUS Liabilities);

 

(d) the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities (other than the Specified
OUS Assets or Specified OUS Liabilities);

 

(e) the matters set forth in _Section 10.02(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule; and

 

(f) the portion of any Employment Related Liabilities to the extent not paid
when required pursuant to _Section 6.02(k)_;

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer be required to
indemnify or hold harmless any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to that
portion of Losses, to the extent arising out of or resulting from conditions
existing or events occurring prior to the Closing, for which a Buyer
Indemnified Party is, or in the absence of the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.04_ would be, entitled to indemnification from Parent and the
Sellers under this Agreement.

 



99 SECTION 10.04. _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) _General_. None of the parties hereto shall be liable to any other,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for any special, indirect,
incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary or other similar type of
damages whatsoever, including diminution in value, loss of business
opportunity or profits, or for any Losses based on a multiple of value, that
in any way arise out of or relate to this Agreement, except to the extent a
Third Party Claim indemnified under this _ARTICLE X_ includes such damages
against the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) _Losses_.

(i) For the purposes of determining whether there has been a failure of a
representation or warranty to be true and correct, or the amount of any Loss
related to a failure of a representation or warranty to be true and correct,
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement (other than
the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.06_ or _3.07_ or
any representation or warranty merely requiring the listing of a material
item) shall be read as if they were not qualified by any concept of
"material," "materiality" or "Seller Material Adverse Effect" or a similar
qualification.

 

(ii) The amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party
shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any tax benefit actually
recognized (determined on a "with and without" basis in the period of the Loss
by the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) arising from the
incurrence or payment of the Loss (net of any related expenses or tax costs),
and (ii) any amounts, including insurance proceeds, actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) from any other third Person, net
of the costs of recovery. Each Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds, benefits and
recoveries; _provided_ that no Indemnified Party or its Affiliates shall be
required to initiate or engage in any Action in pursuit of such proceeds,
benefits or recoveries. If any such benefits or recoveries (including tax
benefits) are recognized or actually received by an Indemnified Party (or any
of its Affiliates) with respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Party has
made an indemnity payment to the Indemnified Party with respect such Losses,
the Indemnified Party (or such Affiliate) shall pay the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such benefits or recoveries (up to the amount of the Indemnifying
Partys indemnity payment).

 

(iii) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of any
Losses, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates),
against any third Person in respect of the Losses to which the payment
relates. Such Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates) and such Indemnifying
Party will execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.

(iv) All Losses under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Losses
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

 

(v) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article X_ with respect to any Losses to the extent that
such Losses are reflected as a decrease to the Purchase Price as a result of
the final calculation pursuant to _Section 2.05_ of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness or Closing Net Intercompany Payable.

 



100 (c) _Claim Threshold; Aggregate Threshold; Maximum Liability_.

 

(i) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
under _Section 10.02(a)_ or under  _Section 10.02(f)(i)(A)_ or _Section
10.02(f)(ii)(A)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (A) for any individual Loss
or series of Losses arising from the same facts and circumstances except to
the extent that the amount of such Losses exceeds $100,000 (the " _De Minimis
Threshold_ ") and (B) unless the amount of the indemnifiable Losses pursuant
to _Section 10.02_ exceeds $7,100,000 (the " _Aggregate Threshold_ "), at
which time rights to indemnification for all such Losses in excess of the
Aggregate Threshold may be asserted up to an amount not to exceed $71,000,000
(the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Aggregate Threshold and
Cap shall not apply to claims resulting from breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or breaches of the representations and warranties in _Section
3.15_. In no event shall Parent or any Sellers have any liability for
indemnification of Losses under _Section 10.02(a)_ in excess of the proceeds
actually received by Parent and the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(ii) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
under _Section 10.03(a)_ (A) for any individual Loss or series of Losses
arising from the same facts and circumstances except to the extent that the
amount of such Losses exceeds the De Minimis Threshold and (B) unless the
amount of the indemnifiable Losses pursuant to  _Section 10.03_ exceeds the
Aggregate Threshold, at which time rights to indemnification for all such
Losses in excess of the Aggregate Threshold may be asserted up to an amount
not to exceed the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Aggregate Threshold
and Cap shall not apply to claims resulting from breaches of the Fundamental
Representations. In no event shall Buyer have any liability for
indemnification of Losses under _Section 10.03(a)_ in excess of the proceeds
actually received by Parent and the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) _Sole Remedy_. Subject to  _Section 10.04(f)_, following the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims against any party or any
of their Affiliates arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement shall
be the remedies provided in  _Section 2.05_, the rights of indemnification
set forth in this _Article X_, and the rights to specific performance set
forth in _Section 11.10_, and no Person will have any other entitlement,
remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, against Parent or
Sellers, it being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and
recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties to the fullest
extent permitted by Law.

 

(e) _Mitigation_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any Losses indemnifiable under this _Article X_ ; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not be deemed to impose any obligation or duty to initiate
any Actions.

 



101 (f) _Fraud_. None of the limitations contained in this _Article X_ shall
apply to claims for intentional fraud solely to the extent embodied in,
subject to _Section 3.25_ and _Section 4.11_ , the express representations
and warranties made by Parent or Sellers in _Article III_ or Buyer in 
_Article _ _IV_ ; _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to limit any remedy set forth in any Ancillary Document.

 

SECTION 10.05. _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the party from whom indemnification is
sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice of any matter that an
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this _Article X_, in accordance with _Section
10.05(b)_, stating the nature and basis of such claim, the amount of the
Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference
to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises and copies of all material written
evidence relevant thereto.

(b) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim (as defined below) shall be asserted by notice to the Indemnifying
Party as promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after
the date that the Indemnified Party obtains Knowledge of such matter, but in
no event after the applicable time periods set forth in  _Section 10.01(a)_
and _Section 10.01(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, any failure of the
Indemnified Party to give notice of such claim within such sixty (60) day time
period shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys
obligations under this _Article X_ with respect thereto unless and to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. In the event that any Action shall be instituted or
that any Action shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which
payment may be sought under _Section 10.02_ or _Section 10.03_ (regardless
of the limitations set forth in  _Sections 10.04(a)_, _10.04(b)_ ,
_10.04(c)_ , and _10.04(f_ _)_ ) (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Party shall promptly, but in no event after the applicable time periods set
forth in  _Section 10.01(a)_ and _Section 10.01(b)_, give written notice of
the assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has Knowledge that is
covered by this _Article X_ to the Indemnifying Party. The failure of
the Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party
Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys
obligations under this _Article X_ with respect thereto unless and to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Subject to this _Section 10.05(b)_, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented
by counsel of its choice (who shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party) and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified against by
it hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses
indemnified against by it hereunder, it shall within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of such Third Party Claim, notify
the Indemnified Party in writing of its intent to do so. Until the
Indemnifying Party timely elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with a Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, or if the Indemnifying Party abandons any such
defense, then the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may participate, at his, her or its own expense, in the
defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if

 



102  (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the
reasonable written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or
potential conflict of interest exists or is likely to exist between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation reasonably advisable; and _provided_ _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such
counsel (plus appropriate local counsel for each relevant jurisdiction) for
all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. The parties
agree to cooperate fully in connection with the defense, negotiation
or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 10.05_ to the contrary, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the
Indemnified Party shall, without the written consent of the other party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (A) settle
or compromise, or attempt to settle or compromise, any Third Party Claim or
(B) permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment, provided in each
case, that the Indemnifying Party may do so if (x) the claimant provides to
the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Third Party Claim, (y) the Third Party Claim
involves no relief other than monetary damages and (z) the settlement or
compromise does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates.

 

(c) If a final decision, judgment or award is rendered by a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom
has expired (or such decision, judgment or award is non-appealable), or a
settlement is consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
arrive at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnifying Party
notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter.

 

(d) This _Section 10.05_ shall not apply to indemnity claims in respect of:
(i) Indemnified Taxes or (ii) breaches of representations or warranties
contained in _Section 3.15_, which shall be governed exclusively by _Section
7.04_.

 

SECTION 10.06. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. For purposes of any Tax,
the parties hereto agree to treat all payments made under any indemnity
provisions contained in this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price to
the extent permissible under applicable Law (and not to take a contrary
position in any Tax Return, audit, or subsequent proceeding or
contest), except to the extent a change in any applicable Law after the
Agreement Date requires otherwise.

SECTION 10.07. _INDEMNIFICATION IN CASE OF STRICT LIABILITY OR INDEMNITEE
NEGLIGENCE_. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS _ARTICLE X_ SHALL BE
ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIABILITY IS BASED UPON PAST, PRESENT OR
FUTURE ACTS, CLAIMS OR LAWS (INCLUDING ANY PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE BULK
TRANSFER ACT, ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, FRAUDULENT TRANSFER ACT, OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
AND HEALTH LAW, OR PRODUCTS LIABILITY, FALSE CLAIMS ACT OR OTHER HEALTHCARE
LAWS, SECURITIES OR OTHER LAWS) AND, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
_SECTION 10.04(E)_, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON
FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION
OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION.

agreements and undertakings, both written and oral (including any offer letter
or term sheet), among Parent, the Sellers and Buyer with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. PARENT AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREBY DISCLAIM,
AND BUYER HEREBY AGREES THAT IT IS NOT RELYING AND HAS NOT RELIED UPON (AND
THAT NO PERSON SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO), ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES EXCEPT FOR THOSE SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE
III_, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER INFORMATION
(OR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF SUCH OTHER INFORMATION) PROVIDED OR MADE
AVAILABLE TO BUYER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, NONE OF PARENT,
ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR
REPRESENTATIVES MAKE OR HAVE MADE ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF ANY INTERNAL OR
PUBLISHED PROJECTIONS, FORECASTS OR REVENUE OR EARNINGS PREDICTIONS FOR THE 

 



105  BUSINESS. BUYER AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREBY DISCLAIM, AND PARENT AND ITS
AFFILIATES HEREBY AGREE THAT THEY ARE NOT RELYING AND HAVE NOT RELIED UPON
(AND THAT NO PERSON SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO), ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES EXCEPT FOR THOSE SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE
IV_ , WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER INFORMATION
(OR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF SUCH OTHER INFORMATION) PROVIDED OR MADE
AVAILABLE TO PARENT OR ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES IN CONNECTION WITH
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 

SECTION 11.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned without the
express prior written consent of Parent and Buyer (which consent may be
granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Parent or Buyer), as the case
may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may, without the consent of
Parent, (a) assign its rights and obligations, in whole or in part,
under this Agreement to one or more of its controlled Affiliates and (b)
assign its rights, in whole or in part, under this Agreement as collateral
security to any of its Lenders.

 

SECTION 11.07. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, Buyer and
Parent or (b) by a waiver in accordance with _Section 11.08_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, this _Section 11.07_, _Section
9.02_, _Section 11.09(a)_,  _Section 11.12_, _Section 11.13_ and _Section
11.19_ may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner materially
adverse to any Lender or any of its Representatives and Affiliates without the
prior written consent of such Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

SECTION 11.08. _Waiver_. Parent or Buyer may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer or Parent and its
Affiliates, respectively, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of Buyer or Parent and its Affiliates, respectively, contained
herein or in any document delivered thereby pursuant hereto or (c) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements of Buyer or Parent and its Affiliates, respectively, or conditions
to such partys obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not
be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of
the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement. The failure of Buyer or Parent to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

SECTION 11.09. _Successors; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal
or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of
this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of _Section
5.11(c)_, _Article X_ , and _Sections 11.09(b)_ , and _11.15_ shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Party or other third-party
beneficiary described in such Sections; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ ,
that the Lenders and their respective Representatives and Affiliates shall be
third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on and enforce,
this  _Section 11.09(a)_, _Section 9.02_, _Section 11.07_, _Section
11.12_, _Section 11.13_, and _Section 11.19_

 



106 (b) All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, at law or
in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement) or the transactions
contemplated hereby, may be made only against the Persons who are expressly
identified as parties to this Agreement. Without limiting the rights of the
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, no Person who is not a named party to
this Agreement, including any past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, equity holder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this Agreement or any
Lender or any of their respective Representatives (collectively, " _Non-Party
Affiliates_"), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of
an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any Liabilities arising
under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its execution or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each party to this Agreement waives and
releases all such Liabilities and claims against any such Non-Party
Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third-
party beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.10. _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Unless
otherwise specified in this Agreement, the rights and remedies of the parties
to this Agreement shall be cumulative. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that
money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement; accordingly, in addition to and not in limitation of any other
remedies available to the parties to this Agreement for a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall be entitled to
specific performance of this Agreement and an injunction restraining any such
party from such breach or threatened breach. Each of the parties hereto herby
waives (i) any defense that a remedy at law would be adequate in any action
for specific performance and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond
or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

SECTION 11.11. _Interpretive Rules_. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and all Article and Section references are to this Agreement unless
otherwise specified. The words "include," "includes" and "including" will be
deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." The word "days"
means calendar days unless otherwise specified herein. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require either party or
their respective officers, directors, Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any
action that would violate or conflict with any applicable Law. The word "or"
shall not be exclusive. The meanings given to terms defined herein will be
equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms.
Whenever the context may require, any pronoun includes the corresponding
masculine, feminine and neuter forms. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all references to "dollars" or "$" will be deemed references to the
lawful money of the United States of America. References to "foreign,"
"outside the United States," "non-United States" or any similar phrase shall
be deemed references to jurisdictions outside of the United States.
References to "domestic" shall be deemed references to the United States.

 



107 SECTION 11.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the India Purchase
Agreement and all claims and causes of action (whether in contract or tort)
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the India
Purchase Agreement or the negotiation, execution, termination, performance
or non-performance of this Agreement, the India Purchase Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any claims or causes
of action based upon, arising out of or relating to any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement or in the India Purchase Agreement) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of Laws of the State of Delaware.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, actions that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
documentation thereof, or the negotiation, execution or performance of any
documentation related thereto, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts thereof. Each
of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or,
in the event (but only in the event) such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, any other court of the State of Delaware or the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, in any dispute, claim, cause of
action (whether in contract or tort) or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the India Purchase Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, termination, performance or non-performance of this Agreement or
the India Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (including any claims or causes of action based upon, arising out
of or relating to any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or in
the India Purchase Agreement). Each of the parties agrees that, subject to
rights with respect to post-trial motions and rights of appeal or other
avenues of review, a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the India Purchase
Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any other state court of the
State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware. Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that any judgment in any such dispute may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or in any other manner provided by
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees (on
behalf of itself and its controlled Affiliates) that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim
of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Lenders or their Representatives, in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (or any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any other letter or
agreement related to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof), in any
forum other than any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York.

 



108 SECTION 11.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY
DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE INDIA
PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES;
THEREFORE, EACH PARTY HERETO EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTIONS (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED
UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE INDIA PURCHASE AGREEMENT
OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, TERMINATION, PERFORMANCE, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF
THIS AGREEMENT, THE INDIA PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION
BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE INDIA PURCHASE AGREEMENT) OR ANY
OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE INDIA PURCHASE AGREEMENT OR
ANY DEALINGS AMONG THEM RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY (OR ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY
WAY TO THE DEBT FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE DEFINITIVE
DOCUMENTATION THEREOF, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO THE DEBT FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR
THE DEFINITIVE DOCUMENTATION THEREOF). THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED
TO ENCOMPASS ANY AND ALL ACTIONS, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS THAT RELATE TO THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND CONTEMPLATED BY THE
INDIA PURCHASE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF
DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY HERETO
REPRESENTS THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (d) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND REPRESENTATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 11.13_.

 

SECTION 11.14. _Exchange Rate_. If applicable Law requires that any payment
pursuant to this Agreement be made in local currency, the parties shall use
the applicable exchange rate published in the _Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern
Edition, three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

SECTION 11.15. _Waiver of Conflict; Disposition of Attorney-Client Privilege_.
In any dispute, action or proceeding arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and any Seller shall
have the right, at their election, to retain the firms of Alston and Bird LLP or
Morris, Nichols, Arsht and Tunnell LLP to represent them in such matter, and
Buyer, for itself and for its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably
waives, and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to waive, any objection
and consent to any

 



109  such representation in any such matter, even if such representation is
directly adverse to the interests of Buyer or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries and even if Alston and Bird LLP or Morris, Nichols, Arsht and
Tunnell LLP represented any of the Transferred Subsidiaries in a matter
directly related to such dispute, action or proceeding. Buyer acknowledges, on
behalf of itself and the Transferred Subsidiaries, that the foregoing
provision shall apply regardless of whether Alston and Bird LLP or Morris,
Nichols, Arsht and Tunnell LLP provides legal services to any Transferred
Subsidiaries after the Closing. Buyer, for itself and its successors
and assigns, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications among Parent, Sellers, (prior to the Closing) the Transferred
Subsidiaries and their counsel, including Alston and Bird LLP or Morris,
Nichols, Arsht and Tunnell LLP, made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute, action or
proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, or any matter relating to any of the foregoing
(the " _Transaction Representation_ "), are privileged communications among
Parent, Sellers, the Transferred Subsidiaries and such counsel and after the
Closing, the privilege shall remain within the exclusive control of Parent
and Sellers. Further, Buyer, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications among Parent,
Sellers, the Transferred Subsidiaries and their counsel, including Alston and
Bird LLP or Morris, Nichols, Arsht and Tunnell LLP, made in connection with
Excluded Liabilities (together with the Transaction Representation solely with
respect to pre-Closing communications, the " _Pre-Closing Representation_")
are privileged communications among Parent, Sellers, the Transferred
Subsidiaries and such counsel and after the Closing, the privilege shall
remain within the exclusive control of Parent and Sellers. Neither Buyer, any
of the Transferred Subsidiaries, nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of
or through Buyer or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, will seek to obtain
the same by any process. In addition, if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, all of Parents, Sellers, and Transferred
Subsidiaries privileged records and the privilege rights and rights in the
privileged information related to such transactions will become property of
(and be controlled by) Parent and Sellers, and the Transferred Subsidiaries
shall not retain any copies of such records or have any access to them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer, the Transferred Subsidiaries or their then-Affiliates following the
Closing, on the one hand, and a third party other than Parent and any of its
then-Affiliates (solely in their capacity as former direct or indirect
equityholders of the Transferred Subsidiaries or former direct or indirect
owners of Assets or the Assumed Liabilities), on the other hand, Buyer, the
Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates may assert the
attorney-client privilege with respect to the Pre-Closing Representation to
such third party and (y) subject to and without waiver of the foregoing, and
for the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that any
pre-Closing attorney-client privilege and other privilege or immunity
attaching to any communication, advice or materials pertaining to the
Transferred Subsidiaries, the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities that would be
relevant to Buyer after the Closing, but not related to the Pre-Closing
Representation, belongs to and shall be controlled by Buyer. Each of Alston and
Bird LLP and Morris, Nichols, Arsht and Tunnell LLP is an intended beneficiary
of this _Section 11.15_ and is entitled to enforce such provision.

 

SECTION 11.16. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and any one of which may be
delivered by facsimile or scanned electronic or e-mail transmission.

 



110 SECTION 11.17. _Conflict Between Transaction Agreements_. The parties agree
that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are in any way
inconsistent with or conflict with any term, condition or provision of any
Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement will govern and control.

 

SECTION 11.18. Releases.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Parent, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, successors, heirs and executors (each, a " _Parent Releasor_ "),
hereby irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily releases, discharges and forever

judgments, claims and demands of whatever kind or nature, whether known
or unknown, which any Parent Releasor has, may have, or might have or may
assert now or in the future, against the Assets or the Transferred
Subsidiaries and its successors, assigns, heirs, executors, officers,
directors and employees (in each case in their capacity as such) (each, a "
_Parent Releasee_ "), arising out of or resulting from any transaction, event,
circumstance, action, failure to act, or occurrence of any sort or type,
whether known or unknown, which occurred, existed, was taken, permitted, or
begun prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in
this _Section 11.18(a)_ shall release, waive, discharge or otherwise affect
the rights or obligations of any party arising under or resulting from this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or any commercial agreement entered into
in the ordinary course of the business of a party. Parent shall, and shall
cause each Parent Releasor, to refrain from, directly or indirectly,
asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced, any legal proceeding of any kind against any Parent Releasee based
upon any matter released pursuant to this _Section 11.18(a)_.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, each Transferred Subsidiary, for itself and
on behalf of its Affiliates, successors, heirs and executors (each, a "
_Buyer Releasor_ ," ), hereby irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily releases,
discharges and forever waives and relinquishes all actions, causes of action,
suits, damages, judgments, claims and demands of whatever kind or nature,
whether known or unknown, which any Buyer Releasor has, may have, or might
have or may assert now or in the future, against Parent or its Affiliates and
their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, officers, directors
and employees (in each case in their capacity as such) (each, a " _Buyer
Releasee_ "), arising out of or resulting from any transaction, event,
circumstance, action, failure to act, or occurrence of any sort or type,
whether known or unknown, which occurred, existed, was taken, permitted, or
begun prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in
this _Section 11.18(b)_ shall release, waive, discharge or otherwise affect
the rights or obligations of any party arising under or resulting from this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or any commercial agreement entered into
in the ordinary course of the business of a party. Each Transferred Subsidiary
shall, and shall cause each Buyer Releasor, as applicable, to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced, any legal proceeding of any kind
against any Buyer Releasee based upon any matter released pursuant to this
_Section 11.18(b)_.

 



111 SECTION 11.19. _Lender Recourse Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, and without limiting the rights of
Buyer or its Affiliates under the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise in
connection with the Debt Financing, each of the parties hereto agrees that (a)
Parent, Sellers, the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Asset Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members and equityholders (i) shall not have any rights or claims
against any of the Lenders or their Representatives or Affiliates, in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any Debt Commitment Letter or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or in respect of any
oral or written representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and (ii) shall not commence any action or
proceeding against any of the Lenders or their Representatives or Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any Debt Commitment
Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or in respect of any
oral or written representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, and (b) no Lender or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates shall have any liability (whether in contract,
in tort or otherwise) to any of Parent, Sellers, the
Transferred Subsidiaries, the Asset Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or equityholders for any obligations or liabilities of any party
hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral or
written representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in

_[Signature Page to Purchase Agreement]_ _Appendix VI_

 

 _Part A (Automatic Transfer Countries)_



   1. | Belgium 
---|--- 



   (a) | The parties hereto agree that the transfer of the Purchased
Assets, including the transfer of the Business Employees, will qualify as a
transfer of undertaking within the meaning of Collective Bargaining Agreement
CBA n° 32bis of 7 June 1985 and that, accordingly, all rights and obligations
of the applicable Asset Seller pursuant to the employment contracts of the
employees identified as Belgian Employees in _Section 6.02(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (" _Belgian Business Employees_ ") shall be
transferred by virtue of Law to Buyer upon the Closing. 
---|--- 



   (b) | All Liabilities relating to the Belgian Business Employees (any
and all Liabilities in relation to wages or other types of remuneration,
labour entitlements, benefits, severance payments, taxes and social
security contributions in respect of the Belgian Business Employees) that
become due and payable on or after the Closing Date shall be assumed by Buyer
but without prejudice to the provisions in respect of Employment-Related
Liabilities under this Agreement.  
---|--- 



   2. | Brazil 
---|--- 



   (a) | The Business Employees in Brazil are those listed in _Section
6.02(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Brazilian Business
Employees_ ," who will also be "Continuing Employees"), who will have their
employment agreements transferred from the applicable Asset Seller to Buyer or
one of its Affiliates by means of an employment transfer offer to be presented
by the parties hereto on a pre-agreed date. 
---|--- 



   (b) | Buyer agrees that the Brazilian Business Employees who accept
transfer/employment offers from Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall receive
at least the same employee benefits and compensation (including base salary
or hourly wage rate, as applicable, bonus or incentive opportunities and
severance) that are provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Closing by the applicable Asset Seller, such that they will not have any
employment conditions or benefits reduced or suppressed, or changed in a way
that causes losses to the employees, as provided for in the Brazilian Labor
Code (Article 468). 
---|--- 



   (c) | Buyer agrees to undertake all labor and social security
obligations under applicable Law arising out from the employment agreements
currently in force between the Brazilian Business Employees and the applicable
Asset Seller but without prejudice to the provisions in respect of
Employment-Related Liabilities under this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   (d) |

Effective as of the Closing Date, or from the employment date of any
Continuing Employee hired pursuant to an offer required by _Section 6.02_,
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume all obligations of
Parent and its Affiliates for the accrued labor rights, including over-accrued
or unused vacation periods and 13th salaries of the Continuing Employees in
Brazil, as provided for in Brazilian Labor Code and Brazilian Federal
Constitution, and shall reimburse, to the extent not assumed, Parent and its 
 unused vacation periods and 13th salaries required to be paid by any of them
to any Brazilian Business Employees, as well as with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan maintained by the applicable Asset Seller that will be continued
or maintained by the Buyer or one of its Affiliates, in which Brazilian
Business Employees will participate after the Closing Date, as provided for
in  _Section 6.01(b)_, _provided_ that any reimbursement shall be limited to
the estimated out-of-pocket cost to Buyer in respect of which Buyer has
benefited from a deduction as an Employment-Related Liability. 
---|--- 



   (e) | The applicable Asset Seller shall bear the corresponding
obligations related to the Brazilian Business Employees for the period before
transfer (including but not limited to wage and salary payments, tax and
social security payments, time off, payment of overtime, working time
payment, any variable payments including profit sharing plans and the
respective social charges, Unemployment Savings Fund deposits, and Social
Security Contributions), and Buyer shall take over all duties, rights,
obligations and liabilities relating to the Brazilian Business Employees for
the period after transfer (including but not limited to wage and salary
payments, tax and social security payments, time off, payment of overtime,
working time payment, variable payments, profit sharing plans and the
