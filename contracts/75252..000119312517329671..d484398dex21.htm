Letter</U>&#148;), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, to lend the amounts set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter for the purposes of financing the
transactions contemplated hereby and related fees and expenses (the &#147;<U>Debt Financing</U>&#148;). The Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee letter are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the &#147;<U>Financing
Agreements</U>.&#148; None of the Financing Agreements has been amended or modified prior to the Agreement Date; and none of the respective commitments contained in the Financing Agreements have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect prior to
the Agreement Date. As of the Agreement Date, the Financing Agreements are in full force and effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or
at Law). Except for fee letter(s) relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (complete copies of which have been provided to Parent, with only the fee amounts and certain economic terms of the market flex (none of which would adversely
affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) redacted), as of the Agreement Date there are no side letters or other Contracts related to the funding or investment, as applicable, of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in
the Financing Agreements delivered to Parent prior to the Agreement Date. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Agreements that are payable by it on or prior to the Agreement Date. The only
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the obligations of the lenders to fund the full amount of Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or any direct investor in Buyer under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Financing Agreements or otherwise would be reasonably likely to
result in any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As of the Agreement Date, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in <U>Sections 8.02(a)(i)</U>, <U>8.02(a)(ii)</U> and <U>8.02(a)(iii)</U>, Buyer has no reason
to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Agreements required to be satisfied by it. Based on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the proceeds from the Debt Financing, together with
the cash or cash equivalents otherwise available to Buyer, will provide Buyer at the Closing with sufficient funds to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and otherwise satisfy all of its obligations under this Agreement, including the
payment of the Purchase Price and all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred by Buyer in connection therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement are not contingent in any respect upon the funding
