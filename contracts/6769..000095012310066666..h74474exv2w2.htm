aggregate Principal Amount together with all accrued interest thereon owed by Seller to Buyer under
the Debenture minus (ii)&nbsp;the Reverse Breakup Fee, in which case, the Reverse Breakup Fee shall be
set off against the payments owed to Buyer by Seller under this Agreement. The Reverse Breakup
Fee, paid in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;17.2, shall constitute the Parties&#146; genuine
pre-estimate of liquidated damages suffered by Seller in such event and shall not be a penalty.
No default or failure by Buyer to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall relieve or release
Seller of or from any of its obligations under the Debenture including the obligation to pay Buyer
the Principal Amount together with all interest accrued thereon up to and including the Maturity
Date; provided that, Seller may retain and set off the Reverse Breakup Fee from the payments due as
