ARTICLE III 
  _PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS AND CONSENTS TO ASSIGNMENT_  

   

 3.1 _Preferential Rights to Purchase._ Within ten (10) Days after the date hereof, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree on (a) the holders of PPRs to which preferential right to purchase notices must be delivered (and thereafter Seller shall supplement Schedule 3.1 accordingly) and (b) an allocation of the Purchase Price to the affected Property; provided, however, that if the Parties are unable to agree on such good faith allocation of the Purchase Price within ten (10) Days of initiating discussions, (i) either Party may submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with Article 19 and (ii) Seller shall use such allocation to provide the preferential right to purchase notifications in connection with the Contribution Transaction and/or Exchange, as appropriate, contemplated hereby, using the form of preferential purchase right notice letter provided by Buyer and agreed to by Seller. To the extent Buyer disagrees with Sellers determination that a preferential right to purchase notice should be sent to a holder of a PPR, Buyer shall have the right to instruct Seller not to send such a notice and Seller shall comply with such instruction; provided, however, that Buyer shall (x) be 

      ##### 

  

    

liable to and (y) indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against (1) any
and all costs and expenses incurred in defending any cause of action arising
out of such holders claim that one or more of the Contribution Transactions
and the subsequent Exchange interfered with such holders exercise of such
PPR and (2) any damages awarded to any such holder as a result of such cause
of action or lawsuit to the extent, and only to the extent, that such damages
are in excess of the Buyers obligation to re-convey the affected Properties
to Seller and to settle the appropriate accounting of all adjustments with
such holder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Following such
ten (10) Day period, Buyer shall have the right to direct Seller to deliver
a preferential right to purchase notice to any other holder of a PPR and, in
such event, Schedule 3.1 shall be updated in accordance therewith, and
Sellers notification obligation, the allocation attributable to the affected
Property and the dispute resolution procedure applicable to such allocation
shall be governed by the immediately preceding sentence. 

    

 3.1.1 If, as of the Exchange Closing Date, a holder of a PPR has notified Seller that it elects to exercise its PPR with respect to the Properties to which its PPR applies (determined by and in accordance with the agreement in which the PPR arises), then Seller shall cause the Properties covered by that PPR to be transferred and conveyed from New GP back to Seller prior to the Exchange Closing Date, but effective as of the Effective Time (subject to the remaining provisions in this Article), such Properties shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute "Excluded Properties" and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by mutually agreed or arbitrated allocation of the Purchase Price attributable to such affected Property(ies). The remainder of the Properties not affected by an exercised PPR, a PPR for which the time to exercise has not expired, or a PPR for which Buyer did not request that a PPR notice be sent shall remain in New GP and subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon the consummation of the sale of any Properties to the holder of such PPR any such Properties shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute "Excluded Properties." 

   

 3.1.2 After the Exchange Closing, if for any reason, the purchase and sale of the Properties covered by a PPR for which Buyer has requested preferential right to purchase notices be sent is not or cannot be consummated with the holder of the PPR that exercised its PPR as to such Properties within ninety (90) Days after such holders receipt of such notice, and such Properties were reconveyed to Seller by New GP, Seller may so notify Buyer and within ten (10) Business Days after Buyers receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell and convey to New GP and Buyer shall cause New GP to purchase and accept from Seller such Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the mutually agreed or arbitrated allocation of the Purchase Price to such Properties adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2 (except adjustments pursuant to Section 2.2 with respect to any such Properties shall be made through the date of the re-conveyance of such Properties from Seller to Buyer). 

   

If on the Exchange Closing Date any PPR for which Buyer has requested
preferential right to purchase notices be sent has not been waived and the
time to elect has not elapsed, the Exchange Closing shall proceed with the
affected Properties included in New GP. If (i) the holder of a PPR validly
exercises its PPR after the Exchange Closing (whether or not in response to a
preferential right to 

   ##### 

  

    

purchase notice), or (ii) the Exchange Closing occurs without such holder
having waived such PPR or the time for such holder to exercise such PPR
having not expired, and after the Exchange Closing, the holder of such PPR
elects to exercise such PPR, then within ten (10) Business Days of (i) or
(ii) above (x) Buyer shall cause New GP to, and Seller shall, execute such
instruments as reasonably necessary to revoke, extinguish and/or rescind the
original Contribution of such affected Property(ies) to New GP by
Seller and/or reconvey such affected Properties to Seller, as appropriate
(each hereinafter a "Rescission"), effective as of the Effective Time, (y)
Seller shall cause an amount to be paid to Buyer equal to the mutually agreed
allocation of the Purchase Price attributable to such affected Property(ies)
adjusted as follows: (1) decreased by the amount of Operating Revenues
attributable to such Properties after the Effective Time that are actually
accounted for, collected or retained by New GP; (2) increased by the Charges
attributable to such Properties after the Effective Time that are paid
or accounted for by New GP; and (3) increased by the amount of taxes and
assessments attributable to such Properties paid by New GP, Buyer and Buyers
Affiliates in accordance with wire instructions to be provided by Buyer at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the end of such ten (10) Business Day
period and (z) any such Properties shall automatically, and without need to
amend this Agreement, be deemed to constitute Excluded Properties for all
purposes of this Agreement, and neither Buyer nor New GP shall have any
further obligations with respect to such Excluded Properties. 

  

 3.2 _Consents to Assign_. 

    

 3.2.1 With respect to contracts, agreements, licenses and permits incident to ownership of or reasonably necessary for the operation of the Properties that require a novation or consent to assignment that has not been obtained prior to the Exchange Closing, Seller shall (i) continue, on an on-going basis to take all commercially reasonable steps and actions to obtain such consent or novation from the applicable Person(s) and (ii) hold such contracts, agreements, licenses and permits as bare trustee and receive and hold all proceeds, benefits and advantages accruing in respect of the contracts, agreements, licenses and permits fully for the benefit, use and ownership of the New GP and the Buyer and represent the New GP and the Buyer in matters under any agreement pertaining to such Properties as directed by Buyer until New GP is substituted and recognized as a party thereto in place of Seller, whether by novation, notice of assignment or otherwise. Seller shall forthwith deliver such proceeds to the New GP provided that Seller shall not be permitted to deduct from such proceeds any costs and expenses it incurs as a result of such delivery to Buyer, except to the extent that Buyer is in breach of its obligations under 3.2.3. 

   

 3.2.2 In connection with its role as bare trustee described in Article 3.2.1, Seller shall deliver all Third Party notices to Buyer and New GP received by it in respect of such contracts, agreements, licenses and permits and, as agent of the New GP and Buyer, do and perform all such acts and things and execute and deliver all such agreements, notices and instruments as Buyer may reasonably request in writing for purposes of facilitating the exercise of rights incidental to the ownership 

   ##### 

  

    

of such contracts, agreements, licenses and permits or required by any
Governmental Authority. 

   

 3.2.3 Buyer shall (i) reimburse Seller for all invoices, cash calls and bills paid by Seller on behalf of the New GP or Buyer which pertain to such contracts, agreements, licenses and permits and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless Seller to the extent that Seller suffers any actual Losses in its capacity as bare trustee under this Article 3.2, except to the extent that such losses are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any member of the Seller Group. 

  

 3.3 _Affiliate Consents and Waivers_. Each Party shall cause its Affiliates to give any required consents and waive any PPR held by such Affiliates 

   

ARTICLE IV 
  _TITLE REVIEW_  

   

 4.1 _Review of Title Records_. After execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller shall make available (during Sellers regular business hours and at their current location) for Buyers review, Records in Sellers or its Affiliates possession or under Sellers or its Affiliates control relating to the Record Owners title to the Properties. If Buyer requests copies of title Records, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the requested copies to Buyer at Buyers expense. Buyer shall conduct its review of Records in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 4.2 _Waiver_. EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE GIVEN BY SELLER IN ARTICLE 10.1.9, THE ASSIGNMENTS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THE CONTRIBUTION TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BUYER WAIVES FOR ALL PURPOSES ALL OBJECTIONS AND DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TITLE TO THE PROPERTIES ; AND BUYER (ON BEHALF OF BUYER GROUP AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IT MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME 

   

ARTICLE V 
  _CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES_  

   

 5.1 _Review of Environmental Materials, Inspection of Premises_. After execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer access (during Sellers regular business hours) to Seller-operated (or New GP-operated, as applicable) Properties, and Seller and New GP will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission for Buyer to gain access to Third Party-operated Properties, to conduct a visual inspection of the same. 

    

 (a) Any such inspection, including through the performance of Phase I Environmental Site Assessments, shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to any releases or other agreements required by the operator of the Properties. Prior to the Exchange Closing, Buyer may not operate equipment, conduct testing, sample materials, perform Phase II environmental audits, or conduct invasive activities during such inspection 

   ##### 

  

    

without Sellers prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall be responsible for arranging, at its own
cost, transportation to and from the Properties. During the time period
between the Exchange Closing and the Adverse Condition Diligence Review
Deadline, Buyer may not conduct testing, sample materials, conduct invasive
activities related to environmental conditions or perform Phase II
environmental audits without in any case obtaining any applicable Third Party
operators prior written consent, and without obtaining Sellers
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless recommended in a Phase I environmental audit or required by applicable
Law in which case Sellers prior written consent will not be required. 

   

 (b) Buyers access to the Properties shall be at Buyers sole risk and expense; and Buyer hereby releases Seller Group from and shall (i) be liable to; and (ii) fully indemnify, defend, protect and hold Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Losses and Third Party Claims to the extent arising out of or connected with Buyers inspection of the Properties or travel to or from or presence on the Properties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 5.2 _Alleged Adverse Conditions_. 

    

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable (and on an ongoing basis), but no later than one hundred twenty (120) Days after the Advance Closing Date (the "Adverse Conditions Diligence Review Deadline"), Buyer shall notify Seller of any conditions that might constitute Alleged Adverse Conditions. Buyers notice of such conditions must include (i) a description of each individual condition to which Buyer takes exception (including any and all supporting documentation) and (ii) an estimate of the costs Buyer in good faith attributes to bring such condition into compliance with applicable Environmental Laws. Seller and Buyer shall meet from time-to-time to attempt to agree on a resolution of Alleged Adverse Conditions. 

   

 (b) If the Parties are unable to agree on resolution of any Alleged Adverse Conditions on or before sixty (60) Days after the Adverse Condition Diligence Review Deadline, Seller has the option, in its sole discretion, to either (i) bring the Alleged Adverse Condition into compliance with Environmental Laws (as in effect as of the Exchange Closing Date); or (ii) deliver to Buyer an indemnity agreement in favor of Buyer Group, upon terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer, fully releasing Buyer Group from and protecting, defending, indemnifying and holding Buyer Group harmless from and against all Environmental Claims arising from or relating to such Alleged Adverse Condition. 

   

 (c) If Seller elects, at its sole cost, to bring any Alleged Adverse Condition into compliance with Environmental Laws (as in effect as of the Exchange Closing Date), Seller may, by notice to Buyer, elect to continue attempting to remediate such condition to completion for up to one hundred 

   ##### 

  

    

eighty (180) Days after the Adverse Condition Diligence Review
Deadline. Sellers remediation of any Alleged Adverse Condition may not
materially interfere with the use of operation of the affected Property. If
Seller does not remediate an Alleged Adverse Condition within such period,
Buyer shall give Seller written notice of such failure or non-completion and
within five (5) Business Days following the earlier to occur of the date that
(i) Seller and Buyer agree in writing on the existence and value of the
Alleged Adverse Condition or (ii) resolution of any dispute regarding the
existence or value of the Alleged Adverse Condition in accordance with the
provisions of Article 5.4, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
value of such Alleged Adverse Condition, if any, as so agreed
or determined. 

   

 (d) If an Alleged Adverse Condition can be remediated, the adjustments or payments with respect to that Alleged Adverse Condition shall not exceed the Prudent Cost Response. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be entitled to an adjustment or other remedy relating to any Alleged Adverse Condition unless and until the aggregate value of all Aggregate Transaction Claims exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent such Aggregate Transaction Claims exceeds the Deductible; and Buyer shall be solely responsible for and bear all costs and expenses associated with any and all Aggregate Transaction Claims up to the Deductible. No payment shall be due with respect to any Alleged Adverse Condition for which Seller, at its option, delivers to Buyer an indemnity agreement in favor of Buyer in accordance with Article 5.2(b) nor shall any Alleged Adverse Condition for which Seller has indemnified Buyer be included as an Aggregate Transaction Claim. 

  

 5.3 _Waiver_. Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) waives for all purposes all objections and claims (whether known or unknown) associated with environmental conditions (including Alleged Adverse Conditions) except for (a) Buyers rights with respect to Sellers indemnity under Article 8, (b) Alleged Adverse Conditions Buyer raised to Seller by proper notice within the applicable time period specified in, and as otherwise required by, Article 5.2, and (c) such Alleged Adverse Conditions as are settled by written agreement of the Parties or determined in accordance with Article 5.4. 

   

 5.4 _Dispute Resolution_. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the existence, validity or value or cure of any Alleged Adverse Condition ("Adverse Condition Dispute"), then, within two hundred ten (210) Days after the Adverse Condition Diligence Review Deadline, such dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Article 5.4 by a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas environmental matters, has not at any point in the past ten (10) years represented or been adverse to any Party and is selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) Days after the delivery and receipt by either Party of a notice of an Adverse Condition Dispute, and absent such agreement, by the Calgary, Alberta office of the ADRI (the "Environmental Referee"). Except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence, any Adverse Condition Dispute arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with Article 

      ##### 

  

    

19\. To the extent that the award of the Environmental Referee with respect to
any Alleged Adverse Condition value is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 6, then within ten (10)
Days after the Environmental Referee delivers written notice to Buyer and
Seller of the award with respect to an Alleged Adverse Condition value, and
subject to the other terms hereof and after taking into account all previous
adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance with Article 6, (i) Buyer
shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental
Referee to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so
awarded by the Environmental Referee to Buyer.

Actual amounts shall be accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlements, unless previously accounted for under the Transition Agreement. Whether Charges and Operating Revenues are attributable to periods before or after the Effective Time shall be determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and PASC standards, based on the accrual method of accounting. 

   

 6.3 _Taxes_. Seller shall bear all Taxes and assessments, including excise taxes, severance or other production taxes, ad valorem taxes and any other federal, state, provincial or local Taxes or assessments attributable to ownership or operation of the Properties prior to the Effective Time; and all deductions, credits or refunds pertaining to the aforementioned Taxes and assessments, no matter when received, belong to Seller.

 6.5.2 As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than forty-five (45) Days after Seller receives Buyers written report, the Parties shall meet to attempt to agree on any adjustments to the Final Accounting Statement. If the Parties fail to agree on final adjustments within that forty-five (45) Day period, either Party may submit the disputed items to the Accounting Referee. The Parties shall direct the Accounting Referee to resolve the disputes within thirty (30) Days after its receipt of relevant materials pertaining to the dispute (and the Parties agree to use their respective reasonable efforts to deliver such materials promptly to the Accounting Referee). 

   

 6.5.3 The Final Accounting Statement, whether as agreed between the Parties or as determined by a decision of the Accounting Referee, shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. The Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages or penalties to either Party 

   ##### 

  

    

with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall share equally the
Accounting Referees fees and expenses. 

   

 6.5.4 Any amounts owed by one Party to the other under the Final Accounting Settlement shall be paid within thirty (30) Days after the earlier of (i) the date that the amounts are agreed by the Parties, and (ii) the date the Parties receive the Accounting Referees decision; and the revenues and expenses included in the Final Accounting Settlement (including any and all Operating Revenues and Charges received and booked by Seller prior to Sellers delivery of the Final Accounting Statement to Buyer) shall be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further review, audit or arbitration. 

  

 6.6 _Post-Final Accounting Settlement Revenues_.

ARTICLE VII 
  _LOSS, CASUALTY AND EXPROPRIATION_  

   

 7.1 _Notice of Loss_. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of all instances of Casualty Loss that occur and become known to Seller between the date of this Agreement and the Exchange Closing. 

       ##### 

  

     

 7.2 _Casualty Loss_. If, prior to the Exchange Closing, any Properties are impacted by a Casualty Loss, Seller and Buyer shall meet to attempt to agree on an adjustment to the Purchase Price reflecting the reduction in value of the Properties because of such Casualty Loss. For this purpose, "reduction in value" is based on the principle that Seller should generally bear the costs of repairing the Properties to the state existing immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, but if such repair results in equipment or facilities that are newer than or upgraded from that which existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, Buyer should bear a portion of such costs as is equitable given the benefit to Buyer of such newer or upgraded equipment, Business Assets or Facilities. No adjustment associated with a Casualty Loss will exceed the value claimed by Buyer in the applicable claim to Seller of such Casualty Loss. 

    

 7.2.1 If the Parties are unable to agree on resolution of a Casualty Loss, the Parties shall consummate the Exchange in accordance with the terms hereof with the Purchase Price being decreased by the arithmetic average of the good faith estimates of the reduction in value associated with such Casualty Loss by both Buyer and Seller; provided, however, that within thirty (30) Days after the Exchange Closing Date, either Party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with Article 19 to resolve the dispute. Any claim with respect to a Casualty Loss not referred to arbitration within thirty (30) Days following the Exchange Closing (or, with respect to any Casualty Loss for which Seller provides notice that it will continue attempting to cure after the Exchange Closing, within thirty (30) Days after the one hundred eighty (180) Day cure period following the Exchange Closing has expired) shall be deemed waived by Buyer for all purposes. 

   

 7.2.2 Seller shall retain any and all insurance proceeds and other payments associated with or attributable to any Casualty Loss.

If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Claim as it deems appropriate without relieving the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligations the Indemnifying Party may have with respect to such Claim. The Indemnifying Partys failure to respond in writing to a Claim Notice within the thirty (30) Day period shall be deemed an election by the Indemnifying Party not to assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim: (a) the Indemnifying Party shall defend the Indemnified Party against the Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice (reasonably acceptable to Indemnified Party which shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in all reasonable respects in such defense), (b) the Indemnifying Party shall pay any judgment entered or settlement with respect to such Claim, (c) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Claim that (i) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to the Claim or (ii) contains terms that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity), and (d) the Indemnified Party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent. In all instances the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel and participate in defense of a Claim, but the Indemnified Party shall bear all fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party.

 12.2 _Buyer s Assumption of Obligations_. If the Exchange Closing occurs, and subject only to Sellers indemnities in Article 5.1 and 5.2, 8.2, 8.3, 8.6, 12.15.4 and 20.3, and except for other matters that are Sellers or its Affiliates express obligations under this Agreement, Buyer agrees that upon the Contribution of the Properties to the New GP, the New GP shall assume, shall pay and shall timely perform and discharge all of Sellers or the New GPs duties and obligations associated with the Properties arising prior to, on or after the Exchange Closing (including any and all contractual duties and obligations arising therefrom) (collectively, the "Assumed Obligations"), and in fulfilling these obligations, New GP shall comply with all Laws. 

   

 12.3 _Asbestos and NORM_. The Properties may currently or have in the past contained asbestos and NORM, and special procedures associated with assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of asbestos and NORM may be necessary, and Buyer acknowledges and agrees as follows from and after the Exchange Closing: 

     ##### 

 

    

 12.3.1 Except with respect to a breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties contained in Article 10, as limited by Article 8, Buyer accepts sole responsibility for and agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses associated with assessment, remediation, removal, transportation and disposal of asbestos and NORM associated with the Properties, and may not claim the fact that assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of asbestos and NORM are not complete or that additional costs and expenses are required in connection with assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of asbestos and NORM as an Alleged Adverse Condition or the basis for any other redress against Seller or its Affiliates, and Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns and the New GP) irrevocably waives any and all Losses and Third Party Claims they may have against Seller Group associated with the same; and 

   

 12.3.2 Except with respect to a breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties contained in Article 10, as limited by Article 8, Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall: (i) be liable to; and (ii) fully protect, defend, indemnify, and hold Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Losses and Third Party Claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation and disposal of asbestos and NORM associated with the Properties, no matter whether arising before, on or after the Effective Time. This indemnity and defense obligation will apply regardless of cause or of any negligent acts or omissions (including sole negligence, concurrent negligence or strict liability), breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-existing defect. For the removal of doubt, Buyers release under this Article 12.3.2 does not prevent Buyer from asserting the existence of an Alleged Adverse Condition under Article 5.2. for asbestos or NORM that is, as of a date prior to the Exchange Closing, in a condition that violates existing Laws. The preceding sentence shall in no way expand Buyers rights under Article 5.2 or diminish Buyers waiver contained in Article 5.3.

have against Seller Group associated with the same; and.

This indemnity and defense obligation will apply regardless of cause or of any negligent acts or omissions (including sole negligence, concurrent negligence or strict liability), breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-existing defect. For the removal of doubt, Buyers release under this Article 12.4 does not prevent Buyer from asserting the existence of an Alleged Adverse Condition under Article 5.2 for any condition that, as of a date prior to Closing, violates existing Laws with respect to Plugging and Abandonment operations. The preceding sentence shall in no way expand Buyers rights under Article 5.2 or diminish Buyers waiver contained in Article 5.3.

breach of any of Sellers representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement to the extent that any such breach

independent public accountants as may be reasonably required by such
independent public accountants to perform an audit in accordance with

ARTICLE XVII 
  _TERMINATION_  

  

 17.1 _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated (except for the individual provisions specifically referenced in Article 17.2 below) at any time prior to the Exchange Closing (unless another date is stated below):

    

 17.1.1 by the Parties mutual written agreement; 

   

 17.1.2 by any Party, if consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would violate any non-appealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction enjoining, restraining, prohibiting or awarding substantial damages in connection with the (a) contemplated transfer of the Target Interests to Buyer in accordance with the terms hereof, (b) the Contribution of the Properties by Seller to the New GP in accordance with the terms hereof, or (c) consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debenture; 

   ##### 

  

   

 17.1.3 by Seller, if Buyer refuses or fails to fulfill its obligations under Article 2.4; 

   

 17.1.4 by either Party, if at any time prior to the applicable Closing Date, such Party becomes aware that any condition precedent to such Partys obligation to consummate either of the Closings cannot be satisfied prior to the applicable Closing Date, provided, however, that the terminating Party shall have given the other Party at least five (5) Business Days in which to attempt to cure the situation and at the end of such cure period, the relevant condition precedent remains unable to be satisfied prior to the applicable Closing Date; 

   

 17.1.5 notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, by either Seller or Buyer, if the Exchange has not occurred on or before the Maturity Date (unless such date is extended by mutual agreement of the Parties); provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Article 17.1.5 if such Party or its Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this Agreement; or 

   

 17.1.6 by either Party, if the Termination Defect Amount meets or exceeds the requisite amount set forth in the definition of such term. 

 

 17.2 _Effect of Termination; Failure to Close_. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 17.2 if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 17.1, such termination is without liability to either Party, except performance of obligations in this Article 17.2, and Articles 5.1(b), 17.3, 17.4, 19.1, 19.2, 20.1, 20.3, 20.7, 20.8, 20.10, 20.12, 20.13, 20.14, 20.15, and 20.18 all of which provisions survive termination of this Agreement. If, upon the Maturity Date, the Exchange has not occurred, Seller shall pay the amount due under the Debenture in accordance with its terms. If, upon the Maturity Date, the Exchange has not occurred because of Buyers material breach of this Agreement, or Buyers failure or refusal to consummate the Exchange Closing that is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to Seller as Sellers exclusive remedy an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price together with Computed Interest thereon from July 30, 2010 to and including the Day immediately preceding such Maturity Date (the "Reverse Breakup Fee"). In such event, in satisfaction of its obligations under the Debenture, Seller shall pay to Buyer in immediately available funds an amount equal to (i) the aggregate Principal Amount together with all accrued interest thereon owed by Seller to Buyer under the Debenture minus (ii) the Reverse Breakup Fee, in which case, the Reverse Breakup Fee shall be set off against the payments owed to Buyer by Seller under this Agreement. The Reverse Breakup Fee, paid in accordance with the terms of this Article 17.2, shall constitute the Parties genuine pre-estimate of liquidated damages suffered by Seller in such event and shall not be a penalty. No default or failure by Buyer to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall relieve or release Seller of or from any of its obligations under the Debenture including the obligation to pay Buyer the Principal Amount together with all interest accrued thereon up to and including the Maturity Date; provided that, Seller may retain and set off the Reverse Breakup Fee from the payments due as aforesaid. Each Party agrees that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Reverse Breakup Fee is paid to Seller in accordance with this Article 17.2, the payment of such Reverse Breakup Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any member of the Seller Group

    ##### 

  

     

against any member of the Buyer Group, and in no event will any member of the
Seller Group seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy
based on a claim at law or in equity with respect to (1) any loss suffered,
directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated, (2) the termination of this Agreement,
(3) any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (4) any
claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or
failure of or under this Agreement, and no member of the Buyer Group shall
have any further liability or obligation to any member of the Seller
Group relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The provisions for payment of the Reverse Breakup Fee as
liquidated damages in this Article 17.2 have been included because, in the
event of termination of this Agreement as described in Article 17.2, both
Buyer and Seller agree that the actual damages that would be incurred by
Seller are reasonably expected to approximate the amount of the Reverse
Breakup Fee and because the actual amount of such damages would be difficult,
if not impossible, to measure precisely and Buyer waives any and all rights
to claim otherwise, and Seller shall have no liability or obligation to any
member of the Buyer Group relating to or arising out of the Reverse Breakup
Fee. 

  

 17.3 _Dispute over Right to Terminate_. If there is a dispute between the Parties over the termination of or over the right of a Party to terminate this Agreement, (i) the Advance Closing shall not occur on the Advance Closing Date or (ii) the Exchange Closing shall not occur on the Exchange Closing Date, as applicable, and the Party that disputes the right of the other Party to terminate is entitled, within thirty (30) Days after the applicable Closing Date, to initiate litigation to resolve the dispute, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to extend such time. If the Party that disputes the other Partys right to terminate this Agreement does not initiate litigation within the thirty (30) Day period, this Agreement shall be deemed properly terminated as of the original date of termination, and the Party that disputes or has a right to dispute termination of this Agreement, on behalf of itself, its Affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, employees, successors and assigns of itself and its Affiliates, irrevocably waives any and all claims it and they may have against the terminating Party for termination of this Agreement.

  

 17.4 _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement remain in full force and effect, provided that upon the earlier to occur of the Exchange or the payment by Seller to Buyer of all amounts owing under the Debenture in accordance with the terms thereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate to the extent (and only to the extent) it applies to the Target Interests conveyed at the Exchange Closing and the Properties intended to be Contributed to the New GP in accordance with the terms hereof.

   

ARTICLE XVIII 
  _TAXES_  

  

 18.1 _Access to Tax Records_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a "Tax Proceeding") with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and making

    ##### 

  

     

employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Buyer and
Seller agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Properties relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Exchange Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (ii) to give the other
party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
the Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon
request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

 (n) In the event that the subject matter of the Arbitrable Dispute gives rise to the possible participation of one or more third parties (other than Affiliates) as plaintiffs or defendants who are not bound to and refuse to participate in an arbitration consistent with the terms of this Arbitration Procedure, then either by the written agreement of the Parties or upon the application of a Party to the Arbitration Tribunal where the Arbitration Tribunal concludes that: 

   

 (i) one or more third parties would be proper parties as plaintiffs or defendants to the Arbitrable Dispute by virtue of there being common questions of fact or law in the Arbitrable Dispute and the matter involving the third party or parties, 

   

 (ii) the absence of the third party or parties in the arbitration could reasonably result in either Party becoming subject to conflicting awards or judgments, and 

   

 (iii) such an outcome could reasonably result in a Party suffering material prejudice, then the arbitration shall be terminated and the Parties shall resolve the Arbitrable Dispute by litigation. 

   ##### 

  

 

 19.3 _Interim Remedies_. Before a notice to arbitrate is given or prior to the selection of the Arbitrators, nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party from applying to a court that would otherwise have jurisdiction for provisional or interim measures. After the Arbitrators have been selected, they shall have sole jurisdiction to hear such applications, except that any measures ordered by the Arbitrators may be immediately and specifically enforced by a court otherwise having jurisdiction over the Parties.

 20.2 _Costs and Exchange Date Consents_. Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for recording and filing documents associated with assignment of the Properties to the New GP, including filing the assignments with appropriate federal, state and local authorities as required by Law. As soon as practicable after recording or filing, Buyer shall furnish Seller all recording data and evidence of all required filings made by Buyer. Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining all consents and approvals of Governmental Authorities customarily obtained subsequent to transfer of title, and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in order to facilitate Buyers obtaining of such consents and approvals. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in negotiating this Agreement and in consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid in full by the Party that incurred such fees, costs and expenses.

  

 20.3 _Brokers, Agents and Finders_. None of Seller nor any of its Affiliates has retained any brokers, agents or finders in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for which Buyer or its Affiliates shall have any liability. Seller releases Buyer Group from and shall fully protect, indemnify and defend Buyer Group and hold them harmless from and against any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, commissions, finders fees or other remuneration due to any agent, broker or finder claiming by, through or under Seller or its Affiliates. Neither Buyer or any of its Affiliates retained any agents, brokers or finders for Buyer associated with the transactions contemplated hereby for which Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have any liability. Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, indemnify and defend Seller Group and hold them harmless from and against any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, commissions, finders fees or other remuneration due to any agent, broker or finder claiming by, through or under Buyer or its Affiliates.

  

 20.4 _Records_. At the Exchange Closing and through the Transition Period, Seller shall grant Buyer reasonable access to the Records. No later than the end of the Transition Period (except as provided below), Seller shall furnish Buyer electronic copies of the Records that are maintained by Seller and such copies of the Records shall become the property of the Buyer; with the understanding that Seller may retain originals or copies of any Records. If Seller retains originals of Records, Seller shall provide a copy of them to Buyer at Sellers expense. Buyer shall cause the New GP to maintain the Records received from Seller for five (5) years after the Exchange Closing Date and afford Seller full access to the Records and a right to copy the Records at Sellers expense as reasonably requested by Seller. In addition, Buyer shall cause the New GP to afford Seller full access to records and data produced after the Exchange Closing Date and reasonably requested by Seller in connection with any claim by Buyer for indemnity or breach of Sellers representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement (excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client communications entitled to legal privilege), and a right to copy such records and data at Sellers expense.

  

 20.5 _Further Assurances_. After the Exchange Closing and on an on-going basis: (a) Buyer shall and shall cause the New GP to execute and deliver or use reasonable

    ##### 

  

     

efforts to cause to be executed and delivered any other instruments of
conveyance and take any other actions as Seller reasonably requests to more
effectively put Seller in possession of any property that was not intended by
the Parties to have been Contributed to the New GP, or to implement the New
GPs assumption of obligations pursuant to Article 12.2; and (b) Seller
shall execute and deliver or use reasonable efforts to cause to be executed
and delivered any other instruments of conveyance and take any other actions
as Buyer reasonably requests to more effectively (1) put the New GP in
possession of the Properties intended to be Contributed to the New GP in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including any other oil and gas
assets included in the Data Room or reflected in the financial information
provided to Buyer in the Data Room or located within the Yukon and Northwest
Territories, the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan,
but excluding the Excluded Properties, which are owned by Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller and which were not previously Contributed to the New
GP, (2) put Seller in possession of and title to any Property that was not
intended to be (x) a Property or (y) conveyed or was conveyed in error
(including reassignment from Buyer to Seller of any Properties that
were conveyed in violation of valid PPRs or material consents to assignment
disclosed in Scheducles to this Agreement and subject to commensurate payment
adjustment, or to implement Buyers assumption of obligations pursuant to
Article 12.2 or (3) provide Buyer with title to the Target Interests in
accordance with the terms hereof and the Debenture. In particular, Seller and
Buyer agree to execute and deliver such instruments and take such other
actions as may be necessary and advisable to: (i) make all filings,
registrations, and recordings which must be made with respect to
the Properties, the Target Interests or the New GP in the records of the
applicable Governmental Authority in order that the records maintained by the
applicable Governmental Authority shall accurately reflect the transfer of
legal title to the Properties from Seller to New GP, (ii) enable Seller to
promptly take all reasonable actions within Sellers control to allow New GP
or its designee to be designated as operator and/or permittee, as
appropriate, with respect to the Facilities, Leases and portions thereof
included in the Properties of which the New GP cannot be the operator and/or
permittee of record, and to recommend that Buyer or its designee be
designated as operator with respect to the other such Facilities, Leases or
portions thereof included in the Properties of which Seller is currently
operator and/or permittee of record; and (iii) obtain prompt and
unconditional applicable Governmental Authority approvals of transfer of the
Properties. Except to the extent constituting Excluded Properties, Seller and
Buyer agree that it is the intent of the Parties that Seller Contribute to
the New GP in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement all of the oil and gas assets owned by Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller, which were included in the Data Room or reflected in the financial
information provided to Buyer in the Data Room or acquired by Seller prior to
the Exchange Closing, including all properties, Petroleum and Natural Gas
Rights and associated pipelines, plants, compressor stations, artificial lift
equipment, facilities, vehicles, buildings and other equipment related to the
exploration for the production, gathering, processing and marketing of
Petroleum Substances located within the Yukon and Northwest Territories and
the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. For a period of
two (2) years after the Exchange Closing Date, to the extent any Affiliate of
Seller has given notice to terminate a Contract pursuant to its terms, Buyer
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to retain such Contract under
the same terms and conditions therein and to extend the term thereof for a
period of two (2) years after the termination date set forth in such
notice.

Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, waivers, disclaimers, releases and obligations of indemnity and defense contained in this Agreement survive the Exchange Closing indefinitely.

  

 20.7 _Amendments and Severability_. No amendments, waivers or other modifications of terms of this Agreement shall be effective or binding on the Parties unless they are written and signed by both Parties. Invalidity of any provisions in this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, and in case of such invalidity, this Agreement shall be construed as if the invalid provision had not been included herein.

  

 20.8 _Successors and Assigns_. Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement, this Agreement may not be assigned (in whole or in part), without the express prior written consent of the non-assigning Party, except that Seller may assign its rights to proceeds hereunder. The terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement are binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns.

 20.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (including the administration of binding arbitration pursuant to Article 19) is governed by the Laws of the Province of Alberta, excluding any choice of law rules that would direct application of Laws of another jurisdiction. Any action permitted by this Agreement to be commenced in court shall be brought and maintained exclusively in the courts of Alberta, Canada, and each Party hereby waives any objection it may have thereto.

  

 20.11 _No Partnership Created_.

    ##### 

  

     

Law or to the extent such data and information is required to be furnished in
compliance with any applicable Laws, or pursuant to any legal proceedings or
because of any order of any court binding upon the issuing Party, or (ii) to
the extent that it must be disclosed pursuant to any rules or requirements of
any government or stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
issuing Party. 

  

 20.13 _Name Change._ Following the Exchange Closing Date, Buyer shall not be entitled to use the expression "BP", including any logo, trademark or design containing such expression, and, accordingly, within three (3) Business Days following the Exchange Closing Date, cause the name of the New GP to be changed to a name that does not contain the expression "BP". Within 90 Days following the Exchange Closing, Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be removed any signage from the Properties that refers to such expression and make all requisite filings with, and provide request notice to, the appropriate Governmental Authorities to place title or other evidence of operation or ownership of the Properties in a name that does not contain the expression "BP".

  

 20.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this Agreement entitles anyone other than Seller or Buyer or their authorized successors and assigns to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind whatsoever, except with respect to waivers and indemnities that expressly provide for waivers or indemnification of Buyer Group or Seller Group, in which case members of such groups are considered third party beneficiaries for the sole purposes of those waiver and indemnity provisions.

  

 20.15 _Not to be Construed Against Drafter_. Each Party has had an adequate opportunity to review each and every provision of this Agreement and to submit the same to legal counsel for review and advice. Based on the foregoing, the rule of construction, if any, that a contract be construed against the drafter shall not apply to interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

  

 20.16 _Indemnities and Conspicuousness of Provisions_. Except to the extent provided otherwise in Article 5.1 of this Agreement, the release, defense, indemnification and hold harmless provisions provided for in this Agreement shall be applicable whether or not the claims, demands, suits, causes of action, losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties and costs (including attorneys fees and costs of litigation) in question arose solely or in part from the active, passive or concurrent negligence, strict liability, breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of any Indemnified Party, or from any pre-existing defect.

  

 20.17 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, that when taken together constitute one valid and binding agreement.

  

 20.18 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to all provisions of this Agreement that specify a time for performance; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed to limit or deprive a Party of the benefits of any grace or use period allowed in this Agreement.
