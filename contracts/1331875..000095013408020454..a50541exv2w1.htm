 WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, Chicago Title Insurance Company, an insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Nebraska and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _CTIC_ "), is entering into a Credit Agreement (the " _Credit Facility_ ") pursuant to which CTIC will make available to Company a line of credit for up to $30,000,000 on the terms and conditions set forth therein; 

   

 WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company. Company shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. 

    ##### 

  

     

 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall (a) file articles of merger, in customary form (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), together with this Agreement, with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the " _SCC_ ") and (b) duly make all other filings and recordings required by the VSCA in order to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of merger by the SCC or at such later time as may be agreed to by Parent and Company in writing and specified in the Articles of Merger (the date and time that the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA. 

   

 1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holder of any of the following securities: 

   

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (b) All shares of common stock, no par value, of Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that are owned by Company or Parent (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company or Parent and held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, " _Trust Account Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Company or Parent in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned subsidiary of Company or Parent shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Company such that each such subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding common stock of the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) Subject to Section 1.4(e), each share of Company Common Stock, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company or Parent and except for Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares, shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II, into the right to receive 0.993 (such amount, as it may be adjusted pursuant to Section 6.11, the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 (d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.3(c). 

   

 (e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _Company Options_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable (but only if the applicable option award agreement as in effect on September 1, 2008 (or, if the grant was made after such date and prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of the initial grant) or the Company Benefit Plan under which the Company Option was granted provides that such Company Option shall vest (or shall become exercisable) upon a change in control or any other event that includes the Merger) and shall be converted into an option (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to purchase the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the exercise price for each such share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole penny), and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that, in the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. 

   

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") shall (i) if and to the extent that the applicable restricted stock award agreement as in effect on September 1, 2008 (or, if the grant was made after such date and prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of the initial grant) or the Company Benefit Plan under which the Company Restricted Share was granted provides that such Company Restricted Shares shall vest (or that applicable restrictions shall lapse) upon a change in control or any other event that includes the Merger, vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger 

   ##### 

  

   

Consideration as provided in Section 1.4(c) of the Agreement, and (ii) if and
to the extent that the applicable restricted stock award agreement as in
effect on September 1, 2008 (or, if the grant was made after such date and
prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of the initial grant) or the
Company Benefit Plan under which the Company Restricted Share was granted does
not provide that such Company Restricted Shares shall vest (or that
applicable restrictions shall lapse) upon a change in control or any other
event that includes the Merger (any such Company Restricted Shares, "
_Unaccelerated Company Restricted Shares_ "), be converted into the number of
whole shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Parent Common Stock equal
to the Exchange Ratio times each such holders number of Unaccelerated
Company Restricted Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Company
Restricted Shares (including applicable vesting requirements). 

   

 (c) As of the Effective Time, each "cash unit" that corresponds to shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Cash Units_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, (i) if and to the extent that the applicable cash unit award agreement as in effect on September 1, 2008 (or, if the grant was made after such date and prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of the initial grant) or the Company Benefit Plan under which the Company Cash Unit was granted provides that such Company Cash Units shall vest (or that applicable restrictions shall lapse) upon a change in control or any other event that includes the Merger, vest in full and be converted into the right to receive cash with a value equal to the product of (x) the Cash Amount (as defined below) and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Cash Unit (less any required Tax withholdings) (such amount the " _Company Cash Unit Consideration_ "), and (ii) if and to the extent that the applicable cash unit award agreement as in effect on September 1, 2008 (or, if the grant was made after such date and prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of the initial grant) or the Company Benefit Plan under which the Company Cash Unit was granted does not provide that such Company Cash Units shall vest (or that applicable restrictions shall lapse) upon a change in control or any other event that includes the Merger (any such Company Cash Units, " _Unaccelerated Company Cash Units_ "), be converted into a cash unit for the number of whole shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio times each such holders number of Unaccelerated Company Cash Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Company Cash Units (including applicable vesting requirements). To the extent Company Cash Unit Consideration is to be paid pursuant to this Section 1.5(c), the Surviving Company or Parent shall pay the holders of Company Cash Units the Company Cash Unit Consideration on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within five business days following the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 1.5(c), " _Cash Amount_ " shall mean the closing price of a share of Company Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape (the " _NYSE_ ") on the Closing Date as reported by The Wall Street Journal. 

   

 (d) As of the Effective Time, all amounts denominated in Company Common Stock and held in participant accounts (other than Company Cash Units) (collectively, the " _Company Deferred Stock Units_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into deferred stock units with respect to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common 

   ##### 

  

   

Stock in which such Company Deferred Stock Units are denominated immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the
nearest whole share) (" _Parent Deferred Stock Units_ "), and otherwise on
the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements,
accelerated vesting thereof and deferral provisions) as applied to
such Company Deferred Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time.
The obligations in respect of the Parent Deferred Stock Units shall be
payable or distributable in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit
Plan relating to such Parent Deferred Stock Units. 

   

 (e) Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions necessary to terminate the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") and all outstanding rights thereunder as of the end of an offering period which ends no later than 14 days prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that Company is under no obligation to take any of the foregoing actions until after November 21, 2008; _provided_ , _further_ , that, from and after the date hereof, to the extent permitted under Section 423 of the Code, Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that no new participants be permitted into the Company ESPP and that the existing participants thereunder may not increase their elections with respect to the current or any subsequent offering period. The offering period in effect as of immediately prior to the time that the Company ESPP is terminated pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall end as of such time and each participant in the Company ESPP will be credited with the number of share(s) of Company Common Stock purchased for his or her account(s) under the Company ESPP in respect of the applicable offering period in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Company shall not grant any awards to which this Section 1.5 applies or any other equity based award on or after the date of this Agreement except as permitted under Section 5.2. The termination of the Company ESPP contemplated by this Section 1.5(e) will not affect a participants rights to shares of Company Common Stock already purchased for the participant under the Company ESPP or payroll deductions held by the administrator under the Company ESPP. 

   

 (f) Prior to the Effective Time, Company, the Board of Directors of Company and the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions and take all other actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.5. 

   

 (g) Parent shall take all action necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options, vesting of restricted Parent Common Stock in respect of Unaccelerated Company Restricted Shares or settlement of the Parent Deferred Stock Units. All of the conversions and adjustments made pursuant to this Section 1.5, including without limitation, the determination of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to any award and the exercise price of the Adjusted Options, shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a post-effective amendment converting the Form S-4 to a Form S-8 (or file such other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents obligations under this paragraph (g).

 1.6 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company will be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc.

Chandler, Jr. to the Parent Board of Directors (to serve in the class of directors with terms expiring at Parents annual meeting of stockholders in 2010) and to appoint Mr. Chandler as Vice-Chairman of the Parent Board of Directors. 

   

 1.8 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION  

  

 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company Subsidiary of Parent or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company, or Parents transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder. 

   

 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall authorize the Exchange Agent to issue an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (together with the proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon actual 

   ##### 

  

   

delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form
and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent
Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")) and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c). 

   

 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II. 

   

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate. 

   

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Company, the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (ii) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the 

   ##### 

  

   

Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be. 

   

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, each former shareholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share shall be paid an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to such holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been issued pursuant to this Article II. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent over (ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "), and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the prevailing prices on the NYSE. The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. All commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of Excess Shares shall reduce, but not below zero, the amount of cash paid to former shareholders of Company in respect of fractional shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the proceeds of such sale to which each former holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the proceeds of such sale by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of fractional share interests to which such holder of Company Common Stock is entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Common Stock are entitled. Until the proceeds of such sale have been distributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such former holders of shares of Company 

   ##### 

  

   

Common Stock in lieu of any fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall
make available in accordance with this Agreement such amounts to such former
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. 

   

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be paid to Parent. In such event, any former shareholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common Stock as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. 

   

 (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.1(c) and (d), if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, on the one hand, and Company, on the other hand, shall use their reasonable best efforts to (x) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and (y) do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction may assert under any Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date), in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; _provided_ that neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of Company or any of its affiliates, unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on Company only in the event that the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to agree to or accept (but in its discretion may agree to or accept), and Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree to or accept, unless requested to do so by Parent (subject to the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence) any Adverse Debt Change or any condition sought by any Governmental Entity or other person in connection with any consent or approval required to complete or otherwise in connection with the Merger that (A) seeks to prohibit or limit in any material respect the ownership or operation by Company, the Surviving Company, Parent or any of their affiliates of the business or assets of any of them, or to compel Company, the Surviving Company, Parent or any of their affiliates to dispose of or hold separate any significant portion of their business or assets as a result of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) seeks to impose limitations on the ability of Parent to acquire, hold, or exercise full rights of direct or indirect ownership of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, including the right to vote the capital stock of the Surviving Company on all matters properly presented to the shareholders of the Surviving Company and the rights to declare or pay dividends on any capital stock of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, (C) seeks to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any material respect the business or operations of Parent, the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries and their affiliates, (D) would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to significantly and adversely affect the benefits, taken as a

 (g) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of Parent, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its personnel, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, operations, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Neither Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (provided, Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers thereof upon request by Company) entered into prior to 

    ##### 

  

    

the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of
the preceding sentence apply.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.5 shall limit the application after the Effective Time to Covered Employees of pay or benefit cuts generally applicable to similarly situated Parent employees. 

   

 (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under each employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause such employee benefit plan to recognize the service of each Covered Employee with Company or its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided that_ the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans or to the extent such operation would result in a duplication of benefits for a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service or to the extent such period of service is not recognized under the applicable Parent employee benefit

plan for its similarly situated employees. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Covered Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the
extent coverage under such plans is comparable to, and a replacement for, a
Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately
before the consummation of the Merger, and (ii) with respect to any health,
dental, vision or other welfare plans of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered
Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or
eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived
with respect to such Covered Employee, to the extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such
Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(y) recognize any health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee in the plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof (i) with the prior written consent of Parent or (ii) as permitted pursuant to Section 5.2(c) of this Agreement, each Company Benefit Plan.

 (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose. 

   

 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (" _Indemnified Party_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any such other person) prior to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or the Credit Facility or any of the transactions contemplated by this 

   ##### 

  

   

Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time,
the parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend
against and respond thereto. Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer
to settle any litigation or other legal proceeding commenced prior to or
after the date hereof against Company or any of its directors or executive
officers, by any stockholder of Company or otherwise, relating to this
Agreement or the Merger without the prior written consent of Parent which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (b) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), and any indemnification agreements which are existing as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent a Virginia corporation is permitted as of the date hereof to indemnify its own officers and directors under applicable Law (but subject to any limitations with respect thereto under any Law applicable to Parent or the Surviving Company after the Effective Time), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Credit Facility, the Insurance Subsidiary Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby) or taken at the request of Parent pursuant to Section 6.7. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies (" _D and O Insurance_") with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each person now covered by Companys D and O Insurance with terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy or policies in effect on the date hereof;  _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend per year of coverage more than 200% of the amount currently expended by Company per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts to do so, Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this paragraph, Parent shall promptly obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. The provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed to have been satisfied if, prior to the Effective Time, six- (6-) year prepaid "tail" policies for the D and O Insurance shall have been obtained by Parent or by Company at the direction of Parent with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each person now covered by Companys D and O Insurance with terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy(ies) in effect on the date hereof. If such prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall maintain such polices in full force and effect to their full term, and continue to honor obligations thereunder. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

   

 6.7 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Parents sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent. 

   

 6.8 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; and _provided_ _further_ that a failure to comply with this Section 6.8 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied. 

   

 6.9 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Company shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate, and the parties shall cooperate with each other as necessary, to cause any deemed disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock or any deemed acquisition of shares of Parent Common Stock by an individual who after the Merger is expected to be subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent, in each case in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

 6.10 _No Solicitation_. (a) None of Company, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals, including the indication of any intention to propose any of the foregoing, being referred to herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Company shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of Companys shareholders, to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, 

   ##### 

  

   

and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.10 and to
first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person proposing
such Alternative Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less
favorable to Company, than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to a
bona fide Alternative Proposal received by Company, and furnish information in
connection therewith ( _provided_ that Company shall simultaneously provide
to Parent any such information that was not previously provided to Parent) if
and only to the extent that and so long as the Board of Directors of Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties to
Companys shareholders under applicable law. 

   

 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Parent or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of the outstanding voting power of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to a merger with Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether from Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Parent or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Company and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of Companys Subsidiaries) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 15% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any such request that does not relate to and would not reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and a copy (if in writing) and summary of the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to an Alternative Proposal. Company shall use its best efforts to keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request. Company shall also provide Parent 24 hours written notice before it enters into any discussions or negotiations concerning any Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 6.10(a). Company shall not enter into any confidentiality or other agreement that would impede its ability to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.10(b). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other than Parent who have been furnished confidential information regarding Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which Company or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an Alternative Proposal. Neither Company nor the Board of Directors of Company shall approve or take any action to render inapplicable to any Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction Article 14 or Article 14.1 of the VSCA, or any similar Takeover Statutes. 

   

 (d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.10(d), neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, the recommendation by the Board of Directors of Company of this Agreement and/or the Merger to Companys shareholders, (ii) take any public action or make any public statement in connection with the meeting of Companys shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3 substantively inconsistent with such recommendation or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or fail to recommend against, any Alternative Proposal (any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Company may make a Change of Recommendation, if, and only if, each of the following conditions is satisfied: 

   

 (i) it receives a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has not been withdrawn; 

   

 (ii) it determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel), that in light of a Superior Proposal the failure to effect such Change of Recommendation would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties to Companys shareholders under applicable law; 

   

 (iii) Parent has received written notice from Company (a " _Change of Recommendation Notice_ ") at least three business days prior to such Change of Recommendation, which notice shall (1) state expressly that Company has received an Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors of Company has determined is a Superior Proposal and that Company intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends or may intend to do so and (2) include the identity of the person making such Alternative Proposal and a copy (if in writing) and summary of material terms of such Alternative Proposal; _provided that_ any material amendment to the terms of such Alternative Proposal shall require a new Change of Recommendation Notice at least two business days prior to such Change of Recommendation; and 

   

 (iv) during any such notice period, Company and its advisors have negotiated in good faith with Parent ( _provided that_ Parent desires to negotiate) to make 

   ##### 

  

   

adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Alternative Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. 

   

 As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal made by a third party (A) to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or 100% of the assets, net revenues or net income of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (B) which is otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of Company determines in its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, that the proposal, (i) if consummated would result in a transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to Companys shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, including to the extent required, financing which is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party. 

   

 (e) Company shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives) of Company or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 6.10 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.10 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.10 by Company. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit Company or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that it shall not effect a Change of Recommendation except as set forth herein. 

   

 6.11 _Bank Sale_. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to sell, prior to the Effective Time, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Centennial Bank, a California industrial bank and an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Company (the " _Bank_ "), whether through the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of its parent company Orange County Bankcorp, a California corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Company, or otherwise, for aggregate net proceeds, including the dividend or distribution of liquid assets to Company or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries, equal to no less than $60,000,000 payable in full prior to the Effective Time (subject to any Company indemnification obligations reasonably acceptable to Parent with respect to such sale but subject to no other post-closing adjustments) and any terms of such sale that survive the closing thereof must be reasonably acceptable to Parent; _provided_  that, in the event that the aggregate net proceeds received by Company in connection with such sale is less than $60,000,000, the Exchange Ratio automatically shall be adjusted to the number (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) determined by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the quotient of the Equity Value Shortfall _divided by_ the Reference Equity Value (each as defined below). All of the net proceeds from such divesture shall be applied to pay down the outstanding indebtedness of Company and its Subsidiaries under the 

   ##### 

  

   

Revolver and the Note Purchase Agreement ( _provided_ , that Company may only
repay outstanding indebtedness under the Note Purchase Agreement for a
repayment price or repurchase price no greater than the aggregate principal
amount outstanding thereunder plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
such repayment or repurchase) and the remainder of such net proceeds, if any,
shall be held separate and used only as approved by Parent. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Equity Value Shortfall_ " means the amount equal to (i)
the Reference Equity Value _less_ (ii) the amount by which (x) $60,000,000
exceeds (y) the aggregate purchase price received by Company in the sale of
the Bank, and " _Reference Equity Value_ " means the product of (A) the
average closing price on the NYSE of the Company Common Stock for the 10
trading days prior to the second business day prior to the Closing Date and
(B) the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the close

this Agreement; 

   

 (d) by either Company or Parent ( _provided that_ the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by Company, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

In addition, in the event that a Pre-Termination Company Takeover Proposal Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred after the date of this Agreement and thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (unless Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement, the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(a), 7.2(d) and 7.2(g) have been satisfied and the condition set forth in Section 7.1(e) has not been satisfied) or Section 8.1(f) or is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), Company shall pay to Parent the Expenses on demand by wire transfer of same-day funds.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
