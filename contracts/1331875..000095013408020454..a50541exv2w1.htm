recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or

and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting
controls described below in this Section&nbsp;4.6(c). Parent (x)&nbsp;has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities, and (y)&nbsp;has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Parent&#146;s outside auditors and the audit committee of Parent&#146;s Board of Directors (i)&nbsp;any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parent&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parent&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting.
These disclosures were made in writing by management to Parent&#146;s auditors and audit committee, a
copy of which has previously been made available to Company. As of the date hereof, there is no
reason to believe that Parent&#146;s outside auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification,
when next due.
