Exhibit 2.1** 

  

TRANSACTION AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of this 15th day of January, 2007, by and between Tandberg Television ASA, a Norwegian public limited liability company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange with its principal place of business at Frystikkalleen 3, 0661 Oslo, Norway ("Tandberg"), and ARRIS Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 3871 Lakefield Drive, Suwanee, Georgia, USA ("ARRIS"). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, ARRIS intends to enter into a business combination with Tandberg pursuant to a recommended public offer (the "Offer") for the outstanding securities of Tandberg. 

  

 WHEREAS, as incentive for ARRIS to prepare and launch the Offer and in consideration of the time and expenses both parties will undertake with respect to the Offer, the parties wish to set forth certain understandings and arrangements. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each party, for the benefit of the other party hereby agrees as follows: 

  

1\. THE TRANSACTION 

   

 1.1 _Press Announcement_. (a) Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Tandberg and ARRIS shall issue a joint press release in the form attached hereto as _Annex A_ (the "Press Announcement") announcing the Offer for Tandberg shareholders to tender each of Tandbergs issued and outstanding shares (the "Shares") in exchange for consideration having a value of 96 Norwegian Kroner ("NOK") per Share consisting of the following: (i) not less than NOK 80 in cash (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) shares of ARRIS common stock (the "Exchange Shares") with a value of up to NOK 16 per Share (the "Share Consideration" and with the Cash Consideration, the "Offer Consideration"). ARRIS shall have the right to increase the amount of the Cash Consideration (with a corresponding and equal reduction in the value of the Share Consideration) so long as the total value of the Offer Consideration equals NOK 96 per Share. The number of Exchange Shares to be issued per Share shall be determined by dividing the amount of the Share Consideration by the Average Closing Price of the ARRIS common stock. In no event shall ARRIS be required to issue a number of Exchange Shares in excess of 19.9% of its common stock issued and outstanding on the date of settlement (the "Stock Threshold"). In the event the calculation of the number of Exchange Shares would exceed the Stock Threshold, the value of the Cash Consideration shall be increased by such an amount (and decrease the value of the Share Consideration by an equal amount) that the Exchange Shares are less than the Stock Threshold. 

  

 ARRIS shall use its reasonable best efforts to issue the Exchange Shares without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") pursuant to Rule 802 under the Securities Act (the "Exempt Issuance") and to ensure that all Exchange Shares issued under an Exempt Issuance shall be issued without any restrictions on transferability and the certificates representing such shares shall contain no restrictive transfer legends. In the event any Exchange Shares issued pursuant to an Exempt Issuance would be subject to restrictions on transferability (except with respect to any restrictions that result from the holder of such Exchange Shares being deemed an "affiliate" of ARRIS, as such term is defined in Rule 144 

   ##### 

  

 

under the Securities Act), as determined by ARRIS, as reasonably consented to
by Tandberg, as soon as practicable following the settlement of the Offer,
but in no event later than three business days after completion of the
Reconciliation (as defined below), ARRIS shall cause to be filed a
registration statement for resale of such Exchange Shares on Form S-3 for a
continuous offering under Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, for
an "Automatic Shelf Offering" (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the
Securities Act)(the "S-3 Registration Statement"). In the event ARRIS is not
eligible to use Form S-3, then ARRIS shall file a registration statement
for resale of such Exchange Shares pursuant to a continuous offering on
another available form, including Form S-1(the "S-1 Registration Statement").
ARRIS shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause such registration
statement to become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
possible and shall cause such registration statement to remain effective at
all times until the date on which the Exchange Shares are sold or otherwise
disposed of. 

   

 In the event ARRIS concludes in its reasonable judgment that the Exchange Shares may not be issued pursuant to an Exempt Issuance, ARRIS shall cause to be filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the "S-4 Registration Statement" and with the S-1 Registration Statement and the S-3 Registration Statement, the "Registration Statement") with respect to the Exchange Shares as soon as practicable following the completion of the reconciliation of Tandbergs historical financial statements required under the Securities Act to be included in the Registration Statement, but in no event more than three business days after completion of such Reconciliation (the "Registered Issuance"). 

  

 As used herein, "Average Closing Price" shall mean the volume weighted average share price of the ARRIS common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the ten (10) trading-day period ending two trading days before the settlement of the Offer. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) whenever a calculation requires that an exchange rate between NOK and United States Dollars be applied, the parties agree to use the reported exchange rate for the NOK to the U.S. Dollar quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing) representing the average of ten previous 12:00 noon rates ending on the applicable business day, and (ii) "business day" means a day other than Saturday, Sunday or any day on which the Oslo Børs is authorized or obligated to close. 

  

 (b) Tandberg shareholders shall have the right to receive their pro rata share of the Offer Consideration in a ratio of Cash Consideration and Share Consideration elected by such Tandberg shareholder, _provided_ , _however_ , that such elections shall be subject to pro rata adjustment in order to ensure that the aggregate Cash Consideration does not exceed an amount equal to the product of (i) the Cash Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares outstanding as of the date of this Agreement plus any Shares of restricted stock that will vest in accordance with Section 1.2(c) below. 

   

 (c) All restricted stock of Tandberg issued pursuant to restricted stock unit awards or otherwise granted under Tandberg plans that by their terms would, by its terms or by action of Tandbergs board of directors, vest upon a change in control of Tandberg will vest and be exercisable to the fullest extent set forth in such awards, and to the extent unexercised in full by the closing of the Offer, will be terminated. Any options to acquire Shares that are not exercised in full by the closing of the Offer will be terminated. 

   

 1.2 _Offer Document; Securities Law Filings_. (a) Subject to applicable laws and regulations, ARRIS shall prepare an offer to purchase relating to the Offer (the "Offer Document") for delivery to the holders of the Shares, as required by the Norwegian Securities Trading Act of 1997 and the regulations thereunder (the "Trading Act"), which Offer Document 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be approved by the Oslo Børs in accordance with the Trading Act. The
Offer will be made according to the terms set forth in Section 1 of Annex B.
Tandberg agrees to provide ARRIS in a timely manner with all information
relating to Tandberg and its affiliates required to be included in the Offer
Document to comply with the disclosure requirements contained in the Trading
Act. Unless a shorter period is required by applicable regulatory
authorities, not less than three (3) business days prior to the date on which
ARRIS is to file the Offer Document with the Oslo Børs, Tandberg and its
counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment thereon. 

   

 (b) In the event of a Registered Issuance, ARRIS shall prepare the Registration Statement and Tandberg shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as ARRIS may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of ARRIS or Tandberg for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, or at the time the Offer Document, which shall include the Registration Statement) is first mailed to Tandbergs shareholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of each of ARRIS and Tandberg supplied or to be supplied by the applicable party for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the accounting requirements and rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") applicable to each party and fairly present the financial condition of each party as of the respective date thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of each party for the respective period then ended. ARRIS shall provide Tandberg and its representatives, including its counsel and auditors, reasonable opportunity and time to review and provide comments to the Registration Statement prior to the time ARRIS files such Registration Statement with the SEC or any amendment or supplement thereto and such document is made publicly available. ARRIS shall not file, submit or furnish any document with the SEC relating to the Registration Statement in a form to which Tandberg reasonably objects. As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event or development, ARRIS shall notify each holder of Exchange Shares that is registering such shares in the Registration Statement, of any untrue statement of a material fact in the prospectus or any supplements thereto contained in the Registration Statement, or omission to state a material fact required therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. ARRIS shall take all other actions reasonably necessary for the holder of Exchange Shares to resell such shares, if applicable. 

   

 ARRIS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC. ARRIS will promptly provide in writing to Tandberg and its counsel any comments, written or oral, of the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement and Tandberg shall cooperate with ARRIS in preparing responses to such comments. All information supplied by or on behalf of ARRIS or Tandberg for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act. ARRIS shall also promptly file, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective as promptly as possible and, if required, mail to Tandbergs shareholders, any amendment to the Registration Statement that becomes necessary after the date the Registration Statement is declared effective or the Offer Document is first mailed to Tandbergs shareholders. ARRIS will provide to holders 

   ##### 

  

 

of the Exchange Shares the number of copies of the prospectus to the
Registration Statement that are reasonably requested. 

   

 (c) Tandberg shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as ARRIS may reasonably request in connection with a determination by ARRIS that the offer and sale of the Exchange Shares in the Offer will qualify for an Exempt Issuance, including, without limitation, requesting, pursuant to a written letter approved in advance by ARRIS, information from nominees holding any Shares regarding any shares that may be held by a U.S. Person. 

   

 (d) ARRIS and Tandberg shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Offer Document to comply with the Trading Act, to respond promptly to any comments of the staff of the Oslo Børs and to have the Offer Document approved under the Trading Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the Oslo Børs. ARRIS will promptly provide in writing to Tandberg and its counsel any comments of the Oslo Børs with respect to the Offer Document and Tandberg shall cooperate with ARRIS in preparing responses to such comments. All information supplied by or on behalf of ARRIS or Tandberg for inclusion in the Offer Document will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Trading Act. ARRIS shall also promptly file, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be approved as promptly as possible and, if required, mail to Tandberg shareholders any amendment to the Offer Document that becomes necessary after the date the Offer Document is first mailed to Tandbergs shareholders. 

   

 (e) ARRIS represents and warrants that (i) Tandberg security holders that are residents of the United States will participate in the Offer on terms at least as favorable as those offered to any other holder of Tandbergs securities, and (ii) it will provide such United States securityholders with the Offer Document and any other related document on a comparable basis that such documents are provided to other securityholders. 

   

 1.3 _Compliance with the Trading Act_. Each of Tandberg and ARRIS undertakes to comply with the Trading Act and the Oslo Børs rulings on interpretation and implementation thereof.

Atlanta, US  15th January 2007  ARRIS (Nasdaq:ARRS), and TANDBERG
Television (Oslo:TAT.OL), today announced that they have reached an agreement
to combine the two companies through an acquisition of all outstanding
TANDBERG Television shares by ARRIS. The offer price of NOK 96 consists of
NOK 80 cash and NOK 16 shares in ARRIS, a US NASDAQ listed company,
although ARRIS can increase the cash portion of the offer at its discretion.
The aggregate purchase is expected to be $1,214 M at current exchange rates.
The transaction is expected to be completed in Q2 2007 and is subject to
regulatory and other customary approvals, as well as, to Arris
receiving valid and unconditional acceptances of the offer from shareholders
representing more than 90% of the shares. 

  

After diligent, thorough review, the Board of Directors of TANDBERG Television
unanimously recommends the shareholders accept the ARRIS offer. "The on-going
industry consolidation amongst our key customer base creates a demand for
companies that can offer an increasing scale and scope of supply on a global
basis. The combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television clearly creates
that market leading supplier of voice, video and data solutions. Further, the
NOK 96 offer price represents a substantial premium of 47% to TANDBERG
Televisions 90 trading day average share price." says Jan Christian Opsahl,
Chairman of TANDBERG Television. 

  

Combining the resources and experience of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television will
produce a new company, unique in its ability to enable voice, video and data
over any network and to any device. ARRIS is a leading global provider of
VoIP, (voice over IP) data broadband network equipment and consumer premises
devices; TANDBERG Television leads the digital video sector with more than 25%
share of the 

  ##### 

  

   

global video processing market and award-winning solutions for advanced
compression, on-demand and interactive television. 

  

ARRIS and TANDBERG Television have a strong shared philosophy of innovation
and track-records of profitable growth. The new company will have a
significant global presence with over 1600 employees and 2000+ customers in
more than 100 countries. ARRIS strong North American cable business
and strategic customers in key international markets will be significantly
expanded through TANDBERG Televisions international market leadership
position in IPTV, HDTV and on-demand television. 

  

"The combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television is positive for the digital
media industry and a truly exceptional opportunity for both companies. By
bringing together these two market leaders we are able to expand on our
vision to be the global leader in the provision of digital IP infrastructure
and to enable voice, video and data to be delivered over integrated
broadband networks from the content provider to the head-end to the home,"
says Bob Stanzione, Chairman and CEO of ARRIS. "With this merger we are
creating a new force, with best in class technologies and an outstanding team
of people with a unique understanding of all service provider networks,
the technologies that enable them and the content that travels through
them." 

  

As cable operators, telcos and pay-TV providers compete for the subscriber,
the triple play of voice, data and video, and the eventual quad play with
mobile, is driving increased bandwidth needs. Additionally, as new services
such as VoIP and high definition, on-demand TV emerge, the pressure on
bandwidth increases further, pushing data speed requirements over 100Mbps.
These macro-trends underpin the combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television
and will drive the future success and growth of the new company and its
highly scalable, revenue producing technologies for high speed data, VoIP,
IPTV, HDTV and on-demand television. 

  

"Our customers are increasingly relying on next generation technologies to
help them create and distribute converged and differentiated voice, data and
video services. There is a clear benefit in being able to source these
solutions from one trusted partner. The combined ARRIS and
TANDBERG Television is ideally placed to 

  ##### 

  

   

provide the technologies, the knowledge and the systems delivery and
integration expertise that our customers around the world can rely on to
build profitable digital businesses," said Eric Cooney, CEO of TANDERG
Television.
