</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of this 15th day of January, 2007, by and between Tandberg
Television ASA, a Norwegian public limited liability company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange with
its principal place of business at Frystikkall&#233;en 3, 0661 Oslo, Norway (&#147;Tandberg&#148;), and ARRIS
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 3871 Lakefield Drive,
Suwanee, Georgia, USA (&#147;ARRIS&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>RECITALS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, ARRIS intends to enter into a business combination with Tandberg pursuant to a
recommended public offer (the &#147;Offer&#148;) for the outstanding securities of
Tandberg.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as incentive for ARRIS to prepare and launch the Offer and in consideration of the
time and expenses both parties will undertake with respect to the Offer, the parties wish to set
forth certain understandings and arrangements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, each party, for the benefit of the other party hereby agrees as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>1. THE TRANSACTION</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 <I>Press Announcement</I>. (a)&nbsp;Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Tandberg
and ARRIS shall issue a joint press release in the form attached hereto as <U>Annex A</U> (the
&#147;Press Announcement&#148;) announcing the Offer for Tandberg shareholders to tender each of Tandberg&#146;s
issued and outstanding shares (the &#147;Shares&#148;) in exchange for consideration having a value of 96
Norwegian Kroner (&#147;NOK&#148;) per Share consisting of the following: (i)&nbsp;not less than NOK 80 in cash
(the &#147;Cash Consideration&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;shares of ARRIS common stock (the &#147;Exchange Shares&#148;) with a
value of up to NOK 16 per Share (the &#147;Share Consideration&#148; and with the Cash Consideration, the
&#147;Offer Consideration&#148;). ARRIS shall have the right to increase the amount of the Cash
Consideration (with a corresponding and equal reduction in the value of the Share Consideration) so
long as the total value of the Offer Consideration equals NOK 96 per Share. The number of Exchange
Shares to be issued per Share shall be determined by dividing the amount of the Share Consideration
by the Average Closing Price of the ARRIS common stock. In no event shall ARRIS be required to
issue a number of Exchange Shares in excess of 19.9% of its common stock issued and outstanding on
the date of settlement (the &#147;Stock Threshold&#148;). In the event the calculation of the number of
Exchange Shares would exceed the Stock Threshold, the value of the Cash Consideration shall be
increased by such an amount (and decrease the value of the Share Consideration by an equal amount)
that the Exchange Shares are less than the Stock Threshold.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARRIS shall use its reasonable best efforts to issue the Exchange Shares without registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) pursuant to Rule&nbsp;802 under the
Securities Act (the &#147;Exempt Issuance&#148;) and to ensure that all Exchange Shares issued under an
Exempt Issuance shall be issued without any restrictions on transferability and the certificates
representing such shares shall contain no restrictive transfer legends. In the event any Exchange
Shares issued pursuant to an Exempt Issuance would be subject to restrictions on transferability
(except with respect to any restrictions that result from the holder of such Exchange Shares being
deemed an &#147;affiliate&#148; of ARRIS, as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;144

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">under the Securities Act), as determined by ARRIS, as reasonably consented to by Tandberg, as
soon as practicable following the settlement of the Offer, but in no event later than three
business days after completion of the Reconciliation (as defined below), ARRIS shall cause to be
filed a registration statement for resale of such Exchange Shares on Form S-3 for a continuous
offering under Rule&nbsp;415 promulgated under the Securities Act, for an &#147;Automatic Shelf Offering&#148; (as
defined in Rule&nbsp;405 promulgated under the Securities Act)(the &#147;S-3 Registration Statement&#148;). In
the event ARRIS is not eligible to use Form S-3, then ARRIS shall file a registration statement for
resale of such Exchange Shares pursuant to a continuous offering on another available form,
including Form S-1(the &#147;S-1 Registration Statement&#148;). ARRIS shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause such registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as possible and shall cause such registration statement to remain effective at all times
until the date on which the Exchange Shares are sold or otherwise disposed of.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event ARRIS concludes in its reasonable judgment that the Exchange Shares may not be

Form S-4 (the &#147;S-4 Registration Statement&#148; and with the S-1 Registration Statement and the S-3
Registration Statement, the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;) with respect to the Exchange Shares as soon
as practicable following the completion of the reconciliation of Tandberg&#146;s historical financial
statements required under the Securities Act to be included in the Registration Statement, but in
no event more than three business days after completion of such Reconciliation (the &#147;Registered
Issuance&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used herein, &#147;Average Closing Price&#148; shall mean the volume weighted average share price of
the ARRIS common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the ten (10)&nbsp;trading-day period

applied, the parties agree to use the reported exchange rate for the NOK to the U.S. Dollar quoted
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or such other source as the parties shall agree in
writing) representing the average of ten previous 12:00 noon rates ending on the applicable
business day, and (ii) &#147;business day&#148; means a day other than Saturday, Sunday or any day on which
the Oslo B&#248;rs is authorized or obligated to close.

Consideration in a ratio of Cash Consideration and Share Consideration elected by such Tandberg
shareholder, <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that such elections shall be subject to pro rata adjustment in
order to ensure that the aggregate Cash Consideration does not exceed an amount equal to the
product of (i)&nbsp;the Cash Consideration and (ii)&nbsp;the number of Shares outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement plus any Shares of restricted stock that will vest in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.2(c)
below.

Tandberg&#146;s board of directors, vest upon a change in control of Tandberg will vest and be

(Oslo:TAT.OL)</B>, today announced that they have reached an agreement to combine the two companies
through an acquisition of all outstanding TANDBERG Television shares by ARRIS. The offer price of
NOK 96 consists of NOK 80 cash and NOK 16 shares in ARRIS, a US NASDAQ listed company, although
ARRIS can increase the cash portion of the offer at its discretion. The aggregate purchase is
expected to be $1,214 M at current exchange rates. The transaction is expected to be completed in
Q2 2007 and is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals, as well as, to Arris receiving
valid and unconditional acceptances of the offer from shareholders representing more than 90% of
the shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">After diligent, thorough review, the Board of Directors of TANDBERG Television unanimously
recommends the shareholders accept the ARRIS offer. &#147;The on-going industry consolidation amongst
our key customer base creates a demand for companies that can offer an increasing scale and scope
of supply on a global basis. The combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television clearly creates that
market leading supplier of voice, video and data solutions. Further, the NOK 96 offer price
represents a substantial premium of 47% to TANDBERG Television&#146;s 90 trading day average share
price.&#148; says Jan Christian Opsahl, Chairman of TANDBERG Television.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Combining the resources and experience of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television will produce a new company,
unique in its ability to enable voice, video and data over any network and to any device. ARRIS is
a leading global provider of VoIP, (voice over IP) data broadband network equipment and consumer
premises devices; TANDBERG Television leads the digital video sector with more than 25% share of

interactive television.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">ARRIS and TANDBERG Television have a strong shared philosophy of innovation and track-records of
profitable growth. The new company will have a significant global presence with over 1600 employees
and 2000&#043; customers in more than 100 countries. ARRIS&#146; strong North American cable business and
strategic customers in key international markets will be significantly expanded through TANDBERG
Television&#146;s international market leadership position in IPTV, HDTV and on-demand television.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&#147;The combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television is positive for the digital media industry and a
truly exceptional opportunity for both companies. By bringing together these two market leaders we
are able to expand on our vision to be the global leader in the provision of digital IP
infrastructure and to enable voice, video and data to be delivered over integrated broadband
networks from the content provider to the head-end to the home,&#148; says Bob Stanzione, Chairman &#038; CEO
of ARRIS. &#147;With this merger we are creating a new force, with best in class technologies and an
outstanding team of people with a unique understanding of all service provider networks, the
technologies that enable them and the content that travels through them.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As cable operators, telcos and pay-TV providers compete for the subscriber, the triple play of
voice, data and video, and the eventual quad play with mobile, is driving increased bandwidth
needs. Additionally, as new services such as VoIP and high definition, on-demand TV emerge, the
pressure on bandwidth increases further, pushing data speed requirements over 100Mbps. These
macro-trends underpin the combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television and will drive the future
success and growth of the new company and its highly scalable, revenue producing technologies for
high speed data, VoIP, IPTV, HDTV and on-demand television.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&#147;Our customers are increasingly relying on next generation technologies to help them create and
distribute converged and differentiated voice, data and video services. There is a clear benefit in
being able to source these solutions from one trusted partner. The combined ARRIS and TANDBERG
Television is ideally placed to

may be extended by ARRIS from time to time, until such time as all of the Offer Conditions have
been satisfied; provided, however such extension shall not be made to a date later than two weeks
prior to the Termination Date. If ARRIS has not received valid and unconditional acceptances of
the Offer for shares representing more than 90% of the Shares at the expiry of the initial Offer
Period, ARRIS shall use its right to extend the Offer Period (one or more times) until such
condition has been satisfied; provided, however, that such extension(s) shall not be later than two
