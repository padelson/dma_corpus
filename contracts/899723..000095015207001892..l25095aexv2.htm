for or reserved against in the Cawse Closing Statement or the HNO Closing Statement (to the extent
of such reserve). The amount of any Covered Loss subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
calculated net of (a)&nbsp;any net insurance proceeds received or receivable by the indemnitee on
account of such Covered Loss and (b)&nbsp;any net Tax benefit recognized by the indemnitee arising from
the recognition of the Covered Loss and any other payment received with respect to a Covered Loss.
The indemnitee shall seek full recovery from any third-parties and under all insurance policies
covering any Covered Loss to the same extent as it would if such Covered Loss were not subject to
indemnification pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In the event any payment is made in
respect of Covered Losses, the indemnitor who made such payment shall be subrogated to the extent
of such payment to any related rights of recovery of the indemnitee receiving such payment against
any third-party. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made or a net Tax benefit is
recognized by the indemnitee with respect to any Covered Loss for which any indemnitor has made a
payment to an indemnitee hereunder, then a refund equal to the amount of any such recovery or
benefit realized by the indemnitee shall be made promptly to the indemnitor that provided such
indemnification to the indemnitee.

herein, each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States

the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, over any claim, dispute or matter
arising under or in connection with this Agreement.

that Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably agrees
that a Judgment in any Proceeding brought in such courts, as applicable, shall be conclusive and
binding upon each party and may be enforced in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereby agree that any such Judgment
