a condition to obtaining any approval from any Governmental Entity for any
reason in order to consummate and make effective the transactions

respective affiliates, the Sellers and Purchaser agree to promptly meet and
negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree reasonable amendments to the

 (e) Neither Purchaser nor the Sellers shall challenge any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement before any Governmental Entity. Any party may (but shall not be obligated to) agree to any request of a Governmental Entity to make a change to any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or any Related Document in order to obtain any Required Regulatory Approval, provided that such term or provision is exclusively to that partys benefit and the relevant change does not adversely affect the interests of the other parties hereto or thereto. 

  

 SECTION 6.06. _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. 

  

 (a) Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except as set forth in this _Section 6.06 _and _Articles IX_ and _X_ , all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys and advisors fees) incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Related Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to _Section 1.04_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that all

filing fees in connection with the Required Regulatory Approvals, exemptions
or other authorization from any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be paid by
the party liable under applicable Law for such fees and in the absence of
such liability being established by applicable Law shall be borne one-half by
OMG and one-half by Purchaser; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event
of any litigation under this Agreement or the Related Documents, including,
without limitation, _Articles IX_ and  _X_ , the prevailing partys costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys and advisors fees, and costs
and expenses incurred in collecting such fees) shall be paid by the non-
prevailing party or parties to such litigation. In determining whether, or the

shall be borne by Purchaser. Any costs incurred verifying and reviewing the
Environmental Reports, shall be borne by the party incurring such costs.

agents reasonable access to the relevant Business Property for purposes of

interfere with the Remediation or the operation of the applicable business;
(ix) keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the progress of any
such Remediation and the schedule for completing such Remediation; (x) within

any rights Purchaser may have against insurers or other third parties.

 (v) With respect to any Tax Returns for any Straddle Period, to the extent permissible, but not required, pursuant to applicable Tax Law, the Sellers shall and Purchaser or its affiliates shall, at the Sellers direction, cause any Company or Cawse to 

   ##### 

  

   

(A) take all steps as are or may be reasonably necessary, including the
filing of elections or returns with applicable Competent Authorities, to
cause such period to end on the Closing Date or (B) if clause (A) is
inapplicable, report the operations of the Company or Cawse only for that
portion of such period ending on the Closing Date in a combined, consolidated,
or unitary Tax Return filed by the Sellers or an affiliate, notwithstanding
that such taxable period does not end on the Closing Date. If the aggregate
accruals or reserves for Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods on the Cawse
Closing Statement or the HNO Closing Statement exceeds the sum of the portion
of all Taxes actually paid in connection with the Tax Returns for all
Straddle Periods that are allocable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods pursuant to 
_Section 9.01(b)_, then Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to such excess to
the Seller within thirty (30) business days after the date on which the last
such Tax Return for a Straddle Period is filed. 

  

 (e) _Cooperation_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit examinations, and any Proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities imposed on or relating to the Sellers, the Companies or Cawse for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and any Straddle Periods, Purchaser, the Companies and Cawse on the one hand, and the Sellers on the other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including by furnishing or making available during normal business hours, records, personnel (as reasonably required and at no cost to the other party), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Competent Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. The Companies and Cawse and the Sellers agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies and Cawse relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and to the extent notified by Purchaser or the Sellers, extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Competent Authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, the Companies and Cawse and the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. Any information obtained under this _Section 9.01(e)_ shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other Proceeding. 

  

 (f) _Refunds and Credits_. Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers any Tax refunds or credits (except to the extent reflected on the Cawse Closing Statement or the HNO Closing Statement or due as the result of utilizing net carried forward operating or capital losses) attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received by or credited to Purchaser, a Company or Cawse, net of any direct costs attributable to receipt of such refund or credit, including Taxes payable with respect to such refund, within ten (10) business days after the receipt of such refund or the realization of such credit. All refunds attributable to any (i) Post-Closing Tax Period or (ii) Pre-Closing Tax Period not otherwise payable to the Sellers shall be for the benefit of Purchaser and if received by or otherwise credited to the Sellers or any affiliate thereof (other than a Company or Cawse), the Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to such refund or credit to Purchaser within ten (10) business days after the receipt of such refund or the realization of such credit. At the Sellers request, Purchaser and the Companies and Cawse shall cooperate with the Sellers in obtaining such refunds, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims as prepared by the Sellers, at the Sellers 

   ##### 

  

 

expense. Purchaser shall permit the Sellers to control the prosecution of any
refund claim attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and, where deemed
appropriate by the Sellers, shall authorize by appropriate powers of attorney
such persons as the Sellers shall designate to represent the Companies or
Cawse with respect to such refund claim. 

   

 (g) _Allocation_. Each of the Sellers and Purchaser agree to allocate the Purchase Price among the Subject Shares and the Talvivaara Shares as set forth in _Schedule 9.01(g)_ (the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect any adjustments made pursuant to  _Section 1.01(b)_, _Section 1.04_ and _Articles IX_ and _X_. Except for adjustments for the parties transaction costs, the Sellers and Purchaser shall report the sale and purchase of the Subject Shares and the Talvivaara Shares in accordance with the Allocation on all relevant Tax Returns and shall not take any position inconsistent with such Allocation unless required by applicable Law. Neither Purchaser nor the Sellers will disclose the Allocation to any Governmental Entity or third party in the absence of an affirmative legal obligation and unless disclosure to a third party (other than a Governmental Entity) is subject to a confidentiality agreement; provided, however, that the Sellers and Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose the Allocation to any Competent Authority on any required Tax Returns and as otherwise required by Law. 

  

 SECTION 9.02. _Tax Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify Purchaser, its affiliates (including the Companies, Cawse, MPI and Talvivaara) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") against and hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Companies and Cawse or any affiliated group of which either of the Company or Cawse has ever been a member for the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent that the sum of all such Taxes exceeds the aggregate accruals or reserves for Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods on the Cawse Closing Statement or the HNO Closing Statement (excluding any deferred Tax assets or liabilities that reflect timing differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their Tax bases) and (ii) all liability for Taxes of the Sellers or any other corporation which is or has been affiliated with the Sellers (other than either of the Companies or Cawse), and (iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than the Companies or Cawse) imposed on the Companies or Cawse as a transferee or successor, by Contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not indemnify and hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnitee from any liability for Taxes attributable to any action taken after the Closing by Purchaser, any of its affiliates (including the Companies, Cawse, MPI or Talvivaara), or any transferee of Purchaser or any of its affiliates (other than any such action expressly required by applicable Law or by this Agreement) or attributable to a breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify the Sellers, their affiliates (excluding the Companies, Cawse, MPI and Talvivaara) and each of the respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") and hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Companies and Cawse for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) all liability for Taxes of the Companies and Cawse for any Pre-Closing Tax Period but only to the extent that the sum of such Taxes does not exceed the aggregate accruals or reserves for Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods on the Cawse Closing Statement or 

   ##### 

  

 

the HNO Closing Statement (excluding any deferred Tax assets or liabilities
that reflect differences between the financial statement carrying value of
assets and liabilities and their Tax bases) and (iii) all liability for Taxes
attributable to any action taken after the Closing by Purchaser, any of its
affiliates (including the Companies, Cawse, MPI or Talvivaara), or any
transferee of Purchaser or any of its affiliates (other than any such action
expressly required by applicable Law or by this Agreement) or attributable to
a breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims. 

   

 (i) If a claim shall be made by any Competent Authority, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this _Section 9.02_ , Purchaser shall notify promptly the Sellers in writing of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_ "). The failure of Purchaser to give such notice shall not relieve the Sellers of their indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent the Sellers are prejudiced by such failure to give such notice. 

   

 (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of either of the Companies or Cawse for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Sellers shall control all Proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, Proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Competent Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner. With respect to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of either of the Companies or Cawse for a Straddle Period, (A) each party may participate in all Proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim, at its expense, and (B) the Proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim shall be controlled by that party which would bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding adjustments that may be anticipated reasonably for future Tax periods. 

   

 (iii) In no case shall any Purchaser Indemnitee settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim without the Sellers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Neither party shall settle a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of either of the Companies or Cawse for a Straddle Period without the other partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 SECTION 10.04. _Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _Third-Party Claims_. In order for a person (the " _indemnified party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under _Section 10.02_ or _10.03_ in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any person against the indemnified party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in reasonable detail) of the Third-Party Claim within ten (10) business days after receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure (although the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the indemnified party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five (5) business days after the indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third-Party Claim. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Assumption_. If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party, who shall consent to such counsel unless it has reasonable objections thereto. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim and the indemnified party consents to the chosen counsel, then: 

   

 (i) the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; 

   

 (ii) the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not to be unreasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense; and 

   

 (iii) all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. 

 

The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the
indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any
period in which the indemnified party shall have failed to give notice of the
Third-Party Claim as provided above). Whether or not the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third-Party Claim and which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (c) _Other Claims_. In the event that any indemnified party has a claim against any indemnifying party under _Section 10.02_ or _10.03_ that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against, or sought to be collected from, such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. Subject to _Section 10.01_, the failure by any indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to such indemnified party under _Section 10.02_ or _10.03_ , except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been prejudiced by such failure. 

  

 (d) _Mitigation_. Purchaser, OMG and the Sellers shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to 

   ##### 

  

 

indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making commercially
reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. In the
event that Purchaser, OMG or the Sellers shall fail to make such commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other
party shall not be required to indemnify any person for any Covered Losses
that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if Purchaser (on one
hand) or OMG or the Sellers (on the other hand), as the case may be, had made
such efforts. 

   

 SECTION 10.05. _No Additional Representations_. Purchaser acknowledges that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (as qualified by the Schedules): 

   

 (i) none of OMG, the Sellers, the Companies or any other person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the Companies or Cawse or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Companies and Cawse furnished or made available to Purchaser and its representatives; 

   

 (ii) Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty from the Sellers or any other person in determining to enter into this Agreement; 

   

 (iii) none of the Sellers or any other person shall have, or be subject to, any liability to Purchaser or any other person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser, or Purchasers use of, any such information, including any information, documents or material made available to Purchaser in the Data Room, or otherwise, management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and 

   

 (iv) should the Closing occur, Purchaser shall acquire the Subject Shares without any representation or warranty as to merchantability or fitness of the assets of the Companies or Cawse for any particular purpose, in an " _as is_ " condition and on a " _where is_ " basis. 

  

 SECTION 10.06. _Adjustments_. All payments made pursuant to _Articles IX_ and  _X_ shall be treated by the parties hereto on all applicable Tax Returns as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 _ARTICLE XI_  

   

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

Each party further irrevocably agrees that a Judgment in any Proceeding brought in such courts, as applicable, shall be conclusive and binding upon each party and may be enforced in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereby agree that any such Judgment may be enforced against any assets and properties of whatever kind and nature, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever located, including the proceeds resulting from the sale or other disposition of any such assets or properties, of each of the parties.

Each party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other party hereto has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 11.10_. 

  

 SECTION 11.11. _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. 

  

 SECTION 11.12. _Specific Performance_. In addition to any other remedies which the parties may have at Law or in equity, the parties hereby acknowledge that the harm to a party resulting from breaches by the other parties hereunder will not be adequately compensated by damages. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that any of them shall have the right to seek an order or decree of specific performance of any of the obligations of the other parties hereunder in the courts identified in _Section 11.09_.
