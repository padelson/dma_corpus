iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of November
20, 2011, is by and among Alleghany Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Alleghany_ "), Shoreline Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Transatlantic_ ").

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Alleghany and Transatlantic
deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its
respective stockholders that Alleghany and Transatlantic engage in a business
combination in order to advance the long-term strategic business interests of
each of Alleghany and Transatlantic;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Alleghany and Transatlantic
have determined that such business combination shall be effected pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement through the Merger in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Alleghany and Transatlantic and
the sole member of Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Merger, and determined that the terms of this Agreement and
the Merger are in the respective best interests of Alleghany, Transatlantic or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, and the stockholders of Alleghany and
Transatlantic and the sole member of Merger Sub;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of Transatlantic to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders to Alleghany (the " _Alleghany Supporting
Stockholders_ ") are entering into a voting and support agreement with
Transatlantic (the " _Alleghany Support Agreement_ "), pursuant to which,
among other things, the Alleghany Supporting Stockholders have irrevocably
agreed, subject to the terms of the Alleghany Support Agreement, to vote all
shares of Alleghany Common Stock (as defined herein) owned by such
stockholders in favor of the Alleghany Requisite Stockholder Vote (as defined
herein);

WHEREAS, each of the parties intends that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, Alleghany, Transatlantic and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Delaware Limited Liabilities Company Act
(the " _DLLCA_ ", and together with the DGCL, " _Delaware Law_ "), on the
Closing Date, Transatlantic shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (the "
_Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Transatlantic shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving
limited liability company after the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany. At the request of Transatlantic,
Alleghany shall either (i) convert Merger Sub into a Delaware corporation, or
(ii) form a wholly-owned subsidiary which shall be a corporation incorporated
in the state of Delaware and such corporation shall be assigned the rights
and shall assume the obligations of Merger Sub contained in this Agreement (in
either case, Merger Subs certificate of incorporation shall be in the form of
_Exhibit A_ ). Thereafter, all references to "Merger Sub" shall be deemed to
be references to such corporation and all provisions applicable to Merger Sub
shall be deemed to be applicable to such corporation _mutatis mutandis_ to
take into account that Merger Sub is a corporation instead of a limited
liability company.

1.2 Closing. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall take place
at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New
York 10166 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, as promptly as practicable (but in no
event later than the second Business Day) following the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in
writing between Alleghany and Transatlantic. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, the certificate of merger relating to the
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form as required by, and
executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
Delaware Law, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall
make all other filings required under applicable Law in connection with
the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such later time as Alleghany and Transatlantic shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. From and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers
and franchises and be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities and
duties of Transatlantic and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 



2 1.5 Organizational Documents.

 

(a) _Surviving Company Organizational Documents_. The certificate of formation
or certificate of incorporation, as applicable, of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated at the
Effective Time to read in the form of _Exhibit B_ (in the case of a
certificate of formation) or _Exhibit C_ (in the case of a certificate of
incorporation), such certificate of formation or certificate of incorporation,
as applicable, shall be the certificate of formation or certificate of
incorporation, as applicable, of the Surviving Company until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The limited
liability company agreement or bylaws, as applicable, of Merger Sub shall be
amended and restated at the Effective Time to be in a form mutually acceptable
to Alleghany and Transatlantic and, as so amended and restated, such limited
liability company agreement or bylaws, as applicable, shall be the limited
liability company agreement or bylaws, as applicable, of the Surviving Company
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_. Subject to applicable
Law, at and immediately after the Effective Time, the managers and authorized
persons of the Surviving Company shall consist of the managers and authorized
persons of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of Transatlantic
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors are
fully elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

1.6 Reservation of Right to Change Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Alleghany
may, with the prior written consent of Transatlantic (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, at any time change the method of effecting the business
combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent that it deems
such a change to be desirable;  _provided_ , that (A) any such change shall
not affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders
of Transatlantic Common Stock and (B) no such change shall (i) alter or change
the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of
Transatlantic Common Stock as Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the
rights of the holders of Transatlantic Stock-Based Awards, or (iii) materially
impede or delay consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In the event Alleghany elects to make such a change and Transatlantic consents
to such a change pursuant to this _Section 1.6_, the parties agree to execute
appropriate documents to reflect the change.

 



3 ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

2.1 Effect on Capital Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Alleghany, Transatlantic, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares
of Transatlantic Common Stock or any limited liability company interest of
Merger Sub:

(i) _Limited Liability Company Interest of Merger Sub_. The sole
limited liability company interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as the sole
limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Transatlantic (the " _Transatlantic Common Stock_ "),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by Transatlantic and each share of Transatlantic Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
owned by Alleghany or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as
defined herein) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; _provided_ , _however_
, that any shares of Transatlantic Common Stock owned or held by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Transatlantic shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth below.

(iii) _Conversion of Transatlantic Common Stock_. Subject to the other
provisions of _Article II_ , each share of Transatlantic Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any
Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares (as defined herein), shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

 

(A) for each share of Transatlantic Common Stock with respect to which a Stock
Election (as defined herein) has been validly made and not revoked pursuant
to _Section 2.3_ (collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "), the right
to receive from Alleghany the fraction of a share of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable Alleghany Common Stock as is equal to the Exchange
Ratio (collectively, the " _Stock Consideration_ ");

 

(B) for each share of Transatlantic Common Stock with respect to which a Cash
Election (as defined herein) has been validly made and not revoked pursuant
to _Section 2.3_ (collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ "), the right to
receive in cash from Alleghany an amount equal to the Per Share Amount
(collectively, the " _Cash Consideration_ "); and

(C) for each share of Transatlantic Common Stock other than shares as to
which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been validly made and not
revoked pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (collectively, the " _Non-Election Shares_
"), the right to receive from Alleghany such Stock Consideration and/or
Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



4 (D) Definitions.

 



     | (i) | " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient, rounded to the
nearest one ten thousandth, of (a) the Per Share Amount divided by (b) the
Alleghany Closing Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | " _Per Share Amount_ " shall mean the sum, rounded to the
nearest one-tenth of a cent, of (A) $14.22 plus (B) the product, rounded to
the nearest one tenth of a cent, of 0.145 (the " _Share Ratio_ ") times the
Alleghany Closing Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | " _Alleghany Closing Price_ " shall mean the average,
rounded to the nearest one tenth of a cent, of the closing sales prices of
shares of Alleghany Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by _The Wall Street
Journal_ for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time occurs. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | " _Cash Component_ " shall mean $816,007,519. 
---|---|--- 

All of the shares of Transatlantic Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Transatlantic
Common Stock represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each
certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any
such shares of Transatlantic Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
the Fractional Share Cash Amount (as defined herein) into which the shares of
Transatlantic Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate
have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_, as well as any dividends
or other distributions to which holders of Transatlantic Common Stock become
entitled in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_.

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Transatlantic
Common Stock held by a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not
voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has
complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders
of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock to require appraisal of their shares
(the " _Appraisal Provisions_ ") of Transatlantic Common Stock (" _Dissenting
Shares_ "), to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described
in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, but shall become the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such
Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect
or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL,
each of such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Transatlantic Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election Shares for all purposes of
this Agreement, unless such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereafter otherwise
make a timely Election (as defined herein) under this Agreement. If any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect or has effectively
withdrawn or lost such Dissenting Stockholders right to dissent from the
Merger after the Election Deadline (as defined herein), each of such
Dissenting Stockholders shares of Transatlantic Common Stock shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into 

 



5  and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive Stock
Consideration or Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined
by Alleghany in its sole discretion. Transatlantic shall give Alleghany
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Transatlantic Common
Stock received by Transatlantic, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give
Alleghany the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect thereto. Transatlantic shall not, without the prior written
consent of Alleghany (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_), the outstanding shares of
Transatlantic Common Stock or Alleghany Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Share Ratio shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such
change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed
to permit Transatlantic or Alleghany to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Alleghany Common Stock
shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Alleghany Common Stock shall be delivered
upon the conversion of Transatlantic Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares of Alleghany
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock converted pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Alleghany Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive,
in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount determined by multiplying (i) the Alleghany Closing Price by (ii) the
fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Transatlantic
Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the
nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Alleghany Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional
Share Cash Amount_ "). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Alleghany
Common Stock.

2.2 Proration.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
total number of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock to be converted into Cash
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ (which, for this purpose,
shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of
the Effective Time) (the " _Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Component by (y) the Per Share
Amount. All other shares of Transatlantic Common Stock (other than
Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into Stock
Consideration.

 



6 (b) Within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Alleghany shall
cause the Exchange Agent (as defined herein) to effect the allocation among
the holders of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock of the rights to receive
the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

 

(i) if the aggregate number of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock with
respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the
Effective Time) (the " _Total Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash
Conversion Number, then (A) all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration,
and (B) Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of
Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which
is the Total Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with _Section 2.2(a)_, whether fractions of Cash Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holders Cash
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration; and

(ii) if the Total Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion
Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Total Cash
Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then
all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration, and the Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares
shall be treated in the following manner:

(x) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by
(2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the
denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 2.2(a)_,
whether fractions of Non-Elections Shares shall be rounded up or down), with
the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

 

(y) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
(1) all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration and (2) all Stock Election Shares shall convert into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock
Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number
of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total
number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total
number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with _Section 2.2(a)_, whether fractions of Stock Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holders
Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

 



7 2.3 Election Procedures.

 

(a) _Alleghany Elections_. Each Person who is a record holder of shares of
Transatlantic Common Stock on the Election Form Record Date (as defined
herein) shall have the right to submit an Election Form specifying (an "
_Election_ ") the number of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock, if any, held
by such Person that such Person desires to have converted into the right to
receive Alleghany Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") and the number of such
shares that the holder desires to have converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Amount in cash (a " _Cash Election_ "). Holders of record of
Transatlantic Common Stock who hold such Transatlantic Common Stock as
nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit a separate
Election Form on or before the Election Deadline with respect to
each beneficial owner for whom such nominee, trustee or representative holds
such Transatlantic Common Stock.

(b) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Alleghany shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Transatlantic to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall
enter into an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") relating to the
Exchange Agents responsibilities under this Agreement.

 

(c) _Mailing of Election Form; Election Deadline_. Alleghany shall prepare and
direct the Exchange Agent to mail a form of election, which form shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Transatlantic (the " _Election Form_ "),
with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the record holders of
Transatlantic Common Stock and Transatlantic Stock Options as of the record
date for the Transatlantic Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Form Record
Date_ "), which Election Form shall be used by each record holder of shares of
Transatlantic Common Stock who wishes to make an Election. Any such holders
Election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have
received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on a date prior
to the Effective Time to be mutually agreed to by Alleghany and
Transatlantic (the " _Election Deadline_ "), an Election Form properly
completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates (unless such shares of
Transatlantic Common Stock are Book-Entry Shares, in which case the holders
shall follow the instructions set forth in the Election Form) of
Transatlantic Common Stock to which such Election Form relates, duly endorsed
in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of
Transatlantic (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss
or destruction of such Certificates or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery
of such Certificates as set forth in such Election Form; _provided_ that such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within five (5)
Business Days after the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery).

(d) _Ability to Revoke Election Forms_. Any stockholder may (i) change his
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline, accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised
Election Form or (ii) revoke his Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of 

 



8  such Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All
Election Forms shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is
notified in writing by Alleghany and Transatlantic that the Merger has been
abandoned and that this Agreement has been terminated. If an Election Form is
revoked, the Certificate(s) (or guarantees of delivery, as appropriate), if
any, for the shares of Transatlantic Common Stock to which such Election Form
relates shall be promptly returned to the stockholder submitting the same to
the Exchange Agent.

(e) _Determination of Exchange Agent Binding_. Subject to the provisions of
the Exchange Agent Agreement, the determination of the Exchange Agent shall be
binding as to whether an Election shall have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this  _Section 2.3_ with respect to shares of Transatlantic
Common Stock and when Elections and revocations were received by it. Subject
to the provisions of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if the Exchange Agent
determines that any Election was not properly made with respect to any shares
of Transatlantic Common Stock, such shares of Transatlantic Common Stock shall
be treated by the Exchange Agent as Non-Election Shares. Subject to the
provisions of the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Agent also shall
make all computations as to the allocation and the proration contemplated by
_Section 2.2_, and any such computation shall be conclusive and binding on
the holders of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock. 

2.4 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Alleghany shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent (i) cash equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to
the extent then determinable, the Fractional Share Cash Amount) and (ii)
evidence of Alleghany Common Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates
representing such Alleghany Common Stock, at Alleghanys election)
representing the number of shares of Alleghany Common Stock sufficient to
deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration (such cash and certificates,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Closing
Date, Alleghany shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock whose shares of Transatlantic
Common Stock were converted pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ (other than
those holders who have properly completed and submitted, and have not revoked,
Election Forms pursuant to _Section 2.3_) into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Alleghany and
Transatlantic may reasonably agree upon prior to the Effective Time) (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_.

 

(c) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with either
an Election Form

 



9  or Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with
the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to
which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance
with _Section 2.4(d)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Transatlantic Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock
records of Transatlantic, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Alleghany
Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share formerly representing such shares of Transatlantic Common Stock may be
paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.4_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration into which
the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_.

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions,
if any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Alleghany
Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of
Transatlantic Common Stock to be converted into shares of Alleghany Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ until such holder shall surrender
such share in accordance with this _Section 2.4_. After the surrender in
accordance with this _Section 2.4_ of a share of Transatlantic Common Stock
to be converted into shares of Alleghany Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to
the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount payable to such
holder pursuant to this _Article II_ ) any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to the share of Alleghany Common Stock represented by
such share of Transatlantic Common Stock.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Transatlantic Common Stock_. The shares
of Alleghany Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the
terms of this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares of Transatlantic
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Transatlantic Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of
Transatlantic other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into
which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with  _Section 2.4(b)_
(together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.4(d_)), without interest, and (ii) the stock
transfer books of Transatlantic shall be closed with respect to all shares

 



10  of Transatlantic Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
Transatlantic shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of
Transatlantic Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing shares of Transatlantic Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Company, Alleghany or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_, subject to applicable Law in the
case of Dissenting Shares.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Alleghany; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Alleghany, upon demand.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Alleghany, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this  _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Alleghany or the Surviving Company (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and
any dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_ without any interest thereon.

(h) _No Liability_. None of Alleghany, Transatlantic, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
Exchange Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the
Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this  _Article
II_ that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares as of the second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, Alleghany and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



11 (j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Alleghany or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Alleghany or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section
2.4(g)_, Alleghany) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and
distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

2.5 Transatlantic Stock Options and Other Equity Awards.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Transatlantic (the
" _Transatlantic Board_ ") (or, if appropriate, the committee thereof
administering the Transatlantic Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

(i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Transatlantic Stock Options to provide
that, at the Effective Time, each Transatlantic Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be
converted into an obligation of Alleghany to pay (or cause to be paid) and a
right of the holder thereof to receive, in full satisfaction of any rights in
respect of the Transatlantic Stock Options, cash in an amount equal to the
product of (A) the applicable Black-Scholes Amount (as defined below) and (B)
the number of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock subject to such
Transatlantic Stock Option, less any income or employment tax
withholding required under the Code or any provision of applicable Law. The
amount determined in accordance with the foregoing shall be paid to the
applicable holder of a Transatlantic Stock Option as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date and in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days following the Closing Date. For purposes hereof, the " _Black-
Scholes Amount_ " shall mean the amount determined by a nationally recognized
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Alleghany and Transatlantic with
respect to each Transatlantic Stock Option granted on a particular day at a
particular price pursuant to the Black-Scholes valuation methodology
consistently applied and based on the assumptions set forth in Section
2.5(a)(i) of the Alleghany Disclosure Schedule;

(ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Transatlantic RSUs to provide that,
at the Effective Time, each Transatlantic RSU outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into an obligation of Alleghany to pay
(or cause to be paid) and a right of the holder thereof to receive, in
full satisfaction of any rights in respect of the Transatlantic RSUs, cash in
an amount equal to the Per Share Amount (each, a " _Converted Transatlantic
RSU_ "), with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Transatlantic RSUs (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions and the
timing of payment, except as otherwise provided in clauses (C) and (D) below);
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the
Transatlantic RSUs held by individuals who are designated as participants in
the Transatlantic Senior Partners Plan or Partners Plan as of the date hereof
as set forth in Section 2.5(a)(ii) of the Transatlantic Disclosure
Schedule(the " _Partners Plan Participants_ ") shall be converted as
previously described, but from and after the Effective Time the cash amounts
underlying the Converted Transatlantic RSUs shall be deemed to be

 



12  notionally invested in the common units of the Surviving Company, with the
initial investment and any future cash payments in satisfaction of such
Converted Transatlantic RSUs to be based on a per unit value of the Surviving
Companys common units equal to the "fully diluted book value per unit" of the
Surviving Company as of the applicable date determined as set forth in Section
2.5(a)(ii) of the Alleghany Disclosure Schedule; (B) subject to any
limitations under applicable Law, the Converted Transatlantic RSUs held by
employees of Transatlantic and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time who are not Partners Plan Participants may, if so elected by
the employee in his or her discretion, be deemed invested in the common units
of the Surviving Company on the same basis as applies to the Partners Plan
Participants; (C) (x) the Transatlantic RSUs held by non-employee members of
the Transatlantic Board will fully vest as of the Closing Date, (y) amounts in
respect of the Converted Transatlantic RSUs held by such individuals will be
paid in cash at the time specified under the Transatlantic 2008 Non-
Employee Directors Stock Plan, and (z) amounts in respect of Converted
Transatlantic RSUs held by such individuals who continue service with the
Alleghany Board following the Closing Date will be deemed to be notionally
invested in Alleghany Common Stock (based on the closing sale price of a
share of Alleghany Common Stock on the Closing Date) until the date of
distribution to such individual; and (D) Transatlantic RSUs that are earned
based on the achievement of performance goals and for which the applicable
performance period is not completed as of the Closing Date shall be treated as
follows: (x) the level of achievement of the applicable performance goal for
any performance-based Transatlantic RSU with a performance period that would
end on or prior to the date that is nine months after the Closing Date will be
determined based on Transatlantics actual performance through the Business
Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (y) the level of achievement
of the applicable performance goal for any performance-based Transatlantic RSU
with a performance period that would end more than nine months after the
Closing Date will be deemed to be earned on the Closing Date at target
level; 

(iii) make such other changes to the Transatlantic Stock Plans as it deems
appropriate to give effect to this  _Section 2.5(a)_ (subject to the
approval of Alleghany, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); and

(iv) ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Transatlantic Stock Options or
other Transatlantic Stock-Based Awards, except as provided in Section
2.5(a)(iv) of the Transatlantic Disclosure Schedule, may be granted under any
Transatlantic Stock Plan and that from and after the Effective Time no current
or former employees, officers, directors or other service providers of
Transatlantic and its Subsidiaries or their beneficiaries have any right to
receive shares of Alleghany Common Stock or Surviving Company common units
under the Transatlantic Stock Plans and the award agreements thereunder.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, and subject to compliance by Transatlantic with
_Section 2.5(a)_, Alleghany shall assume the obligations in respect of the
outstanding Transatlantic Stock Options and Transatlantic RSUs consistent with
the terms of _Sections 2.5(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_.

 

(c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Transatlantic Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take all

amendments, to (i) terminate the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Stock Purchase Plan_ ") as of no later than immediately prior 

 



13  to the Effective Time, (ii) ensure that no offering period under the Stock
Purchase Plan shall be commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (iii)
if the Effective Time shall occur prior to the end of the offering periods in
existence under the Stock Purchase Plan on the date of this Agreement, cause a
new exercise date to be set under the Stock Purchase Plan, which date shall be
the end of the payroll period that is at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the anticipated Effective Time, (iv) prohibit participants in the Stock
Purchase Plan from altering their payroll deductions from those in effect on
the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in
the Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Stock Purchase Plan), (v) provide that the amount of the accumulated
contributions of each participant under the Stock Purchase Plan as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to
purchase shares of Transatlantic Common Stock in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Stock Purchase Plan (as amended pursuant to this  _Section
2.5(c)_, be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time (without interest); and (vi) ensure that no current or
former employees, officers, directors or other service providers
of Transatlantic and its Subsidiaries or their beneficiaries have any right
to receive shares of Alleghany Common Stock or Surviving Company common units
under the Stock Purchase Plan.

 

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Transatlantic Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take all
necessary actions, including adopting any necessary resolutions and
amendments, to (i) ensure that no new rights to purchase shares of
Transatlantic Common Stock will be issued under the 2010 Sharesave Plan (the "

(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Alleghany Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the

stock option, severance, employment, change-in-control, fringe benefit,
bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and all other employee benefit plans,
agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject
to ERISA (including any funding mechanism therefor now in effect or required
in the future as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise), whether formal or informal, written, legally binding or not,
under which any employee or former employee of Alleghany or its Subsidiaries
has any present or future right to benefits or Alleghany or its Subsidiaries
has had or has any present or future liability (each, an " _Alleghany Benefit
Plan_ "). With respect to each such Alleghany Benefit Plan, Alleghany has
made available to Transatlantic a true and complete copy of such Alleghany
Benefit Plan, if written, or a description of the material terms of such
Alleghany Benefit Plan if not written, and to the extent applicable, (i) all
trust agreements, Insurance Contracts or other funding arrangements; (ii) the
most recent actuarial and trust reports for both ERISA funding and financial
statement purposes; (iii) the most recent Form 5500 with all attachments
required to have been filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ")

Governmental Entity in any non-U.S. jurisdiction having jurisdiction over any
Alleghany Benefit Plan and all schedules thereto; (iv) the most recent IRS

under or in violation of any Alleghany Benefit Plan and (iii) no action
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) is, to the knowledge
of Alleghany, pending or threatened in writing with respect to any Alleghany
Benefit Plan by any current or former employee, officer or director of
Alleghany or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to

IRS that it is so qualified and each related trust that is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has
received a determination or opinion letter from the IRS that it is so exempt
and, to the knowledge of Alleghany, no fact or event has occurred since the
date of such letter or letters from the IRS that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Alleghany Benefit Plan
or the exempt status of any such trust.

(d) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
reasonably expected to be incurred by Alleghany or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan,"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly
maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is
considered one employer with Alleghany under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (an " _Alleghany ERISA Affiliate_ "). Alleghany and its
Subsidiaries have no liability (contingent or direct) with respect to any

under Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or Section 430 of the Code.

(e) All material contributions required to be made under each Alleghany
Benefit Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made. Neither any
Alleghany Benefit Plan nor any single-employer plan of an Alleghany ERISA
Affiliate has failed to satisfy the minimum funding standard within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. It is not
reasonably anticipated that any Alleghany Benefit Plan is, or is expected to
be, in "at-risk" status (as defined in Section 430 of the Code or Section 303
of ERISA). Alleghany has no liability pursuant to Section 4069 of ERISA.

as required by applicable Law. Alleghany has reserved the right to amend,
terminate or modify at any time all Alleghany Benefit Plans providing for
retiree health or life insurance coverage or other retiree death benefits, and
there have been no communications to employees or former employees which could
reasonably be interpreted to promise or guarantee such employees or former
employees retiree health or life insurance or other retiree death benefits on
a permanent basis.

Section 409A of the Code was administered in reasonable, good faith compliance
with the requirements of Section 409A through December 31, 2008, and all
arrangements of Alleghany or any of its Subsidiaries that are subject to
Section 409A, provide for payment after December 31, 2008 and were in
existence on such date have been amended to comply with the requirements of
the final regulations under Section 409A, in each case except as would not,
individually or in the

 



27  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Alleghany Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Alleghany nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
provide any gross-up payment to any individual with respect to any income
Tax, additional Tax, excise Tax or interest charge imposed pursuant to Section
409A or 4999 of the Code.

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(h) of the Alleghany Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to which
each of Alleghany and Merger Sub is a party, will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former director,
officer or employee of Alleghany or of any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment; (ii) result in any
payment becoming due, accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due to any such director, officer or employee;
(iii) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness, trigger any funding
obligation under any Alleghany Benefit Plan or impose any restrictions or
limitations on Alleghanys rights to administer, amend or terminate any
Alleghany Benefit Plan; or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1) that could
reasonably be expected, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

to wages, hours, collective bargaining, employment discrimination, civil

of employees, and the collection and payment of withholding and/or social
security Taxes, except where noncompliance would not reasonably be expected to
result in an Alleghany Material Adverse Effect.

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Alleghany Material Adverse
Effect, (a) neither Alleghany nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice, demand, request for information, citation, summons or Order,
and no complaint has been filed, no penalty has been assessed, no liability
has been incurred, and no investigation, action, written claim, suit or
proceeding is pending or is

 



28  threatened in writing by any Governmental Entity or other Person with
respect to or arising out of any applicable Environmental Law and (b) no
"release" of a "hazardous substance" (as those terms are defined in the

or any Alleghany Subsidiary under any applicable Environmental Law.

3.19 Intellectual Property.

 

(a) Each of Alleghany and its Subsidiaries owns or otherwise has a valid and
enforceable license or right to use material Intellectual Property used in
the respective businesses of Alleghany and each of its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted; and all patents and all registrations for trademarks,
service marks and copyrights owned by Alleghany or its Subsidiaries are valid
and subsisting, except to the extent Alleghany or its Subsidiaries have
determined to abandon such patents or registrations for trademarks, service

(b) To the knowledge of Alleghany, there are no claims pending or threatened
in writing by any Person alleging that Alleghany or its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses as conducted on the date of this Agreement infringes the
Intellectual Property of any Person, which, if determined or resolved
adversely against Alleghany or any Alleghany Subsidiary, would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
Alleghany and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the knowledge of
Alleghany, no Person is infringing the Intellectual Property owned by
Alleghany or any of its Subsidiaries, which infringement would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to Alleghany and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(c) Alleghany and its Subsidiaries have established and are in compliance with
commercially reasonable security programs that are sufficient to protect (i)
the security, confidentiality and integrity of transactions executed through
their computer systems, including encryption and/or other security protocols
and techniques when appropriate; and (ii) the security, confidentiality and
integrity of all confidential or proprietary data, except, in each case,
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have an Alleghany Material Adverse Effect. Neither Alleghany nor any of its
Subsidiaries has suffered a material security breach with respect to their
data or systems, and neither Alleghany nor any of its Subsidiaries has
notified customers or employees of any information security breach. Alleghany
and its Subsidiaries take reasonable steps to protect their material trade

been disclosed to any Person except pursuant to written and enforceable
confidentiality obligations.

constitute a default thereunder by any party thereto, and neither Alleghany

another event, (i) entitle any current or former director, officer or employee

payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section

Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alleghany Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



62 (b) Transatlantic shall not, and shall cause the Transatlantic Subsidiaries
and each officer or director of Transatlantic or any Transatlantic Subsidiary
not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each controlled
Affiliate and any employee, agent, consultant or representative (including any
financial or legal advisor or other representative) of Transatlantic, any of
the Transatlantic Subsidiaries or any such controlled Affiliate not to, and on
becoming aware of it, shall use its best efforts to stop any such Person from
continuing to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information or by
amending, or granting any waiver under, the Rights Agreement, as applicable)
or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals
regarding, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any merger, share
exchange, amalgamation, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of
capital stock (including by way of a tender offer or exchange offer)
or similar transactions involving Transatlantic or any of the Transatlantic
Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute a Competing Transaction
(any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as a "
_Transatlantic Acquisition Proposal_ " and, together with any Alleghany
Acquisition Proposal, each an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information in
connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
facilitate in any way any effort by, any Person in connection with, any
Transatlantic Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement regarding, or that is intended to result in, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Transatlantic Acquisition
Proposal (a " _Transatlantic Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(c) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Transaction_ " means, with respect
to Alleghany or Transatlantic, as the case may be (for this purpose, the "
_Target Party_ "), any of (i) a transaction, including any tender offer,
exchange offer or share exchange, pursuant to which any third Person (or
group) other than the other party to this Agreement (the " _Non-Target Party_
") or such third Persons Affiliates, or the stockholders of such third
Person, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire beneficial ownership
(as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of 10% or more of the
outstanding shares of common stock of the Target Party or of the outstanding
voting power of the Target Party (or options, rights or warrants to purchase,
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such common stock or other
securities representing such voting power), whether from the Target Party or
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or business combination pursuant to which any
third Person or group of Persons (other than the Non-Target Party or
its Affiliates) party thereto, or the stockholders of such third Person or
Persons, beneficially owns or would beneficially own 10% or more of the
outstanding shares of common stock or the outstanding voting power of the
Target Party, or, if applicable, any surviving entity or the parent entity
resulting from any such transaction, immediately upon consummation thereof,
(iii) a recapitalization of Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any
transaction similar to a transaction referred to in  _clause (ii)_ involving
the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant

 



63  to which any third Person or group of Persons (other than the Non-Target
Party or its Affiliates) party thereto, or its stockholders, beneficially owns
or would beneficially own 10% or more of the outstanding shares of common
stock or the outstanding voting power of the Target Party or such Subsidiary
or, if applicable, the parent entity resulting from any such transaction
immediately upon consummation thereof or (iv) any transaction pursuant to
which any third Person or group of Persons (other than the Non-Target Party or
its Affiliates) directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, amalgamation, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture or otherwise) acquires or would acquire control of
assets (including for this purpose the equity securities of, or other
ownership interest in, Subsidiaries of the Target Party and securities of the
entity surviving any merger or business combination involving any of the
Subsidiaries of the Target Party) of the Target Party or any of its
Subsidiaries representing 10% or more of consolidated revenues, net income, or
EBITDA for the last 12 full calendar months or the fair market value of all
the assets of the Target Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
transaction involving solely the acquisition of capital stock or assets of
any Alleghany Subsidiary by Alleghany, or of any Transatlantic Subsidiary by
Transatlantic, will be deemed to be a Competing Transaction. Wherever the term
"group" is used in this Agreement, it is used as defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Exchange Act.

(d) The Target Party shall notify the Non-Target Party promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry or request for non-public information relating to the Target Party
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records
of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that is
reasonably likely to lead to or contemplate an Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice to the Non-Target Party shall be made orally and in writing and
shall indicate the identity of the Person or Persons making the Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry or requesting non-public information or access to the
properties, books or records of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries,
and a copy of the Acquisition Proposal or, if not in writing, a written
summary in reasonable detail of the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request or modification or amendment to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Target Party shall (i) keep the Non-Target Party fully
informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status of, and
any material changes or modifications in the terms of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and, if requested by the Non-Target Party,
counsel for the Target Party shall consult with counsel for the Non-Target
Party once per day, at mutually agreeable times, regarding such status and any
such changes or modifications, and (ii) provide to the Non-Target Party as
soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Target Party
from any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or sent or
provided by the Target Party to any third party in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that any material written
material or material correspondence shall be sent or provided pursuant to
_clause (ii)_ within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof. Neither
Alleghany nor Transatlantic shall enter into any agreement on or after the
date hereof that would prevent such party from providing any information
required by this _Section 5.5_ to the other party.

 



64 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.5_, at any
time prior to obtaining the Alleghany Requisite Stockholder Vote or the
Transatlantic Requisite Stockholder Vote, as applicable, the Target Party may
furnish or cause to be furnished information to, and enter or cause to be
entered into discussions with, and only with, a Person (and its
representatives) who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
was not solicited on or after the date of this Agreement and that did not
otherwise result from a breach of _Section 5.5(a)_ or  _Section 5.5(b)_, as
applicable, if the Target Partys Board of Directors (the " _Target Board_ ")
has (i) determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor or advisors) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the
failure to enter into discussions regarding the Acquisition Proposal would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii)
provided at least three Business Days notice to the Non-Target Party of its
intent to furnish information to or enter into discussions with such Person in
accordance with this _Section 5.5(e)_, and (iii) obtained from such Person
an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms that are determined in
good faith by the Target Party to be substantially similar to and not less
favorable to the Target Party, in the aggregate, than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement and any related agreements (x) need not include a standstill or
similar provision and (y) shall not include any provision calling for any
exclusive right to negotiate with such Person or having the effect of
prohibiting the Target Party from satisfying its obligations under this
Agreement). Unless such information has been previously provided to the Non-
Target Party, all information that is provided by the Target Party to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall be provided to the Non-Target
Party. During the three Business Day period set forth in _clause (ii)_ , the
Non Target Party shall have the right to make a presentation to the Target
Board.

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal made by a third Person (or group of Persons) (and
not obtained in breach of this Agreement, including, without limitation, this
_Section 5.5_) to consummate a merger, amalgamation, consolidation, business
combination or other similar transaction involving the Target Party pursuant
to which such third Person would acquire beneficial ownership of more than 50%
of the outstanding shares of common stock of, or more than 50% of the
outstanding voting power of, the Target Party, any surviving entity or the
parent entity resulting from any such transaction immediately upon
consummation thereof that the Target Board (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor or advisors) determines in
good faith to be more favorable to the Target Partys stockholders than the
Merger, taking into account all relevant factors, including value and other
financial considerations, legal and regulatory considerations and any
conditions to, and expected timing and risks of, completion, as well as any
changes to the terms of the Merger proposed by the Non-Target Party in
response to such Superior Proposal.

 

(g) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.5(g)_, neither the Target Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any
manner adverse to the Non-Target Party) the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Target Board or any such committee of this
Agreement and the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable
the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or (C) resolve, agree or publicly
propose to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this _Section
5.5(g)(i)_ being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ")
or (ii) cause or permit the Target Party to enter into, or resolve, agree or
propose publicly to do so with respect to, any Alleghany Acquisition

 



65  Agreement (in the case of Alleghany) or Transatlantic Acquisition Agreement
(in the case of Transatlantic) (other than a confidentiality agreement as
referred to in _Section 5.5(e)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 5.5_, at any time prior to obtaining the Alleghany Requisite
Stockholder Vote (in the case of Alleghany) or the Transatlantic Requisite
Stockholder Vote (in the case of Transatlantic) the Target Board may, if the
Target Board determines in good faith that the failure to do so would result
in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, taking into account
all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by the
Non-Target Party pursuant to this _Section 5.5(g)_, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Target Party may not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (1) the Target Party promptly
notifies the Non-Target Party in writing at least three Business Days before
taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifying the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of
any Person making any Acquisition Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishing
a copy of any relevant Alleghany Acquisition Agreement (in the case of
Alleghany) or Transatlantic Acquisition Agreement (in the case of
Transatlantic) and any other relevant transaction documents (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new written notice
by the Target Party and a new three Business Day-period) and (2) prior to the
expiration of such three Business Day-period, in the case of an Acquisition
Proposal, the Non-Target Party does not make a proposal to adjust the terms
and conditions of this Agreement that the Target Board determines in
good faith to be at least as favorable as the Acquisition Proposal after
giving effect to, among other things, the payment of any fees set forth in
_Section 6.6_, such that the Target Board determines such action is no longer
required by its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Target Party
under applicable Law. During the three Business Day-period prior to its
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Target Party shall, and shall
cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with the Non-Target
Party in good faith (to the extent the Non-Target Party seeks to negotiate)
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by the Non-Target Party. Notwithstanding any Adverse
Change of Recommendation by Alleghany or Transatlantic, this Agreement shall
be submitted to the stockholders of Alleghany (at the Alleghany Stockholders
Meeting) or to the stockholders of Transatlantic (at the Transatlantic
Stockholders Meeting), as applicable, for the purpose of obtaining the
Alleghany Requisite Stockholder Vote or the Transatlantic Requisite
Stockholder Vote, as applicable, and nothing contain herein shall be deemed to
relieve Alleghany or Transatlantic, as applicable, of such obligation;
_provided_ , _however_ that if either the Alleghany Board or the Transatlantic
Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, then such board of
directors may submit the proposals required to be approved to obtain the
Alleghany Requisite Stockholder Vote or the Transatlantic Requisite
Stockholder Vote, as the case may be, without recommendation (although the
resolutions adopting this Agreement or the approving the Merger or the
Stock Issuance, as the case may be, as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded), in which event such board of directors may communicate the basis
for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders in the Form S-4 and/or
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as applicable, or an appropriate amendment
or supplement thereto to the extent required by applicable Law. The Target
Party shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition
Proposal, or, except as permitted herein, propose to do so. 

 



66 (h) (i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prohibit the Target
Party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and (ii) no disclosure that the Alleghany Board or the
Transatlantic Board may determine (after consultation with counsel) that it
or Alleghany or Transatlantic, as applicable, is required to make under
applicable Law shall constitute a violation of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in any event neither the Alleghany Board nor the
Transatlantic Board shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change except in
accordance with _Section 5.5(g)_. Any disclosure by the Target Party relating
to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change by the Target Party, unless the Target Board reaffirms its
recommendation and declaration of advisability with respect to this Agreement
in such disclosure.

 

(i) Each of Alleghany and Transatlantic and their respective Subsidiaries
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions
or negotiations with any Persons (other than the other party to this
Agreement) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons, other than the other
party hereto, who have been furnished confidential information regarding such
party in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an
Acquisition Proposal within the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this
Agreement promptly to return or destroy such information. Each of Alleghany
and Transatlantic and their respective Subsidiaries will strictly enforce any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which it is a party to, or
a beneficiary of, and will not waive or amend any provision of any such
agreement.

(j) It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this  _Section 5.5_ by any director, officer, employee, controlled
Affiliate, agent or representative (including financial or legal advisor or
other retained representative) of either party or any of its Subsidiaries or
controlled Affiliates shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.5_
by such party.

Transatlantic Stockholders Meeting to a date that is no later than 30 days
after the date on which the original Transatlantic Stockholders Meeting was
scheduled to be held (i) with the consent of Alleghany; (ii) for the absence
of a quorum; (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and

information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may
withhold any document or information (i) that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date

ordinary course of business ( _provided_ that the withholding party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third
party to provide such access or disclosure), (ii) the disclosure of which

6.3 Required Actions. 

(a) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary to consummate
and make effective, as soon as reasonably possible, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall
prohibit either party from taking any action expressly contemplated by
_Section 5.5_.

 



70 (b) In connection with and without limiting _Section 6.3(a)_, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to

authorizations, permits or orders from all third parties and Governmental
Entities, including those required to satisfy the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1(d)_ and _Section 7.1(f)_, so as to enable the Closing to occur
as soon as reasonably practicable. To the extent necessary in order to
accomplish the foregoing, Alleghany and Transatlantic shall jointly propose,
negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the holding separate, sale, divestiture or any other
disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on, (A) the ownership or
operation by Alleghany, Transatlantic or any of their respective Subsidiaries

the Transatlantic Subsidiaries, including the right to vote, or (C) Alleghany
or any of its Subsidiaries effectively controlling the business or operations
of Alleghany and the Alleghany Subsidiaries or Transatlantic and the
Transatlantic Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Transatlantic nor Alleghany shall be required pursuant to this
_Section 6.3(b)_ to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect any action that
is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. If the actions taken
by Transatlantic and Alleghany pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
do not result in the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ and _Section
7.1(f)_ being satisfied, then each of Transatlantic and Alleghany shall
jointly (to the extent practicable) initiate and/or participate in any
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, in order to (i) oppose or
defend against any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other
Person to challenge, prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) take such
action as is necessary to overturn any regulatory action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person to challenge or block, in whole or in
part, consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including by defending any suit, action or other legal
proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity or other Person in order
to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated,
including by appeal if necessary, any Injunction or other prohibition

satisfied by it under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ , that a failure to comply with
this _Section 6.3(d)_ will not constitute the failure of any condition set
forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, unless the underlying inaccuracy or
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied.

(e) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each of the parties hereto, Alleghany, as sole member of Merger Sub, will
adopt this Agreement.

(f) Each of Transatlantic and Alleghany shall use its reasonable best efforts

_Surviving Company Indenture_ ") and (ii) comply with the applicable
provisions of the Surviving Company Indenture, including the delivery of any
opinion of counsel required thereunder.

6.5 Indemnification and Directors and Officers Insurance.

(a) Alleghany agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of Transatlantic and the Transatlantic Subsidiaries
(each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall be assumed by Alleghany and shall
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Alleghany shall purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy for Transatlantic, the
Transatlantic Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors
and officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Transatlantic, in a 

 



73  form reasonably acceptable to Transatlantic, that shall provide
Transatlantic, the Transatlantic Subsidiaries and such directors and officers
with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by Transatlantic; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no
event shall Alleghany be required to expend for such policy an amount in
excess of 250% of the annual aggregate premiums currently paid by Alleghany
for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). Alleghany shall maintain such
policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder. If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only
be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium,
Alleghany will cause to be maintained the most advantageous policies of
directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ will survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. Alleghany shall
pay or cause to be paid (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided for in this  _Section 6.5_ (subject
to reimbursement if the Indemnified Party is subsequently determined not to be
entitled to indemnification under _Section 6.5(a)_).

(d) If Alleghany or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of Alleghany, as the case may be,
will assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_.

6.6 Fees and Expenses.

 

(a) Except as provided in this _Section 6.6_, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Alleghany and Transatlantic shall share equally (i) all fees
and expenses in relation to the printing and filing of the Form S-4 and the
printing, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
(ii) any filing fees required in connection with the Merger pursuant to the

74  in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,

6.1(e)_, then the non-terminating party shall, in addition to the Expense
Reimbursement, pay the terminating party a fee equal to the Alternate
Termination Fee; provided, further that the payment by either party of the
Expense Reimbursement and/or the Alternate Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 6.6(b)_ shall not relieve such party of any subsequent obligation
to pay any fees pursuant to _Section 6.6(e)(iv)_ or _Section 6.6(f)(iv)_, as
applicable, except to the extent set-off of such amount is permitted as

Reimbursement pursuant to this  _Section 6.6(c)_ shall not relieve

LIBOR is available for such date, on the next preceding date for which such a
quotation is available) plus 250 basis points. The parties acknowledge
and agree that the neither the Termination Fee nor the Alternate Termination
Fee shall constitute either a penalty or liquidated damages, and the right of

Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not limit or otherwise affect such
partys right to specific performance as provided in _Section 9.10_, such
partys rights as set forth in _Section 8.2_ or _Section 9.7_ or any
other remedies that may be available for breaches of this Agreement,

its directors relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this paragraph,

of Alleghany and Transatlantic in these matters and the applicable privileges
and protections provided therein, and the non-litigating party may offer

individual who, prior to the end of his or her term, is asked to cease being a
member of the Transatlantic Board and who does not become a member of
the Reconstituted Alleghany Board in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and who, at such time, qualifies as an
independent director under the listing standards of the NYSE and does not
possess an interest in any transaction for which disclosure would be required
pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, shall have immediate vesting of all
of his or her unvested Converted Transatlantic Stock-Based Awards.

 

6.10 Retention Agreements. Transatlantic and Alleghany shall each use their
respective reasonable best efforts during a period of fifteen days following
the date hereof to agree to terms of retention agreements for those
individuals listed in Section 6.10 of the Transatlantic Disclosure Schedule.
Upon reaching such agreement, Transatlantics management shall
recommend approval of such agreements by the Transatlantic Board. In the
event of approval by the Transatlantic Board, Transatlantic shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the retention agreements between
Transatlantic and each of the individuals listed in Section 6.10 of the
Transatlantic Disclosure Schedule to be amended and restated (or, with respect
to a listed individual who is not currently a party to any retention
agreement, cause a new retention agreement to be entered into) in a form
mutually agreed by Transatlantic and Alleghany, which agreement in the case of
an amended and restated agreement or an agreement replacing a previously
offered retention agreement, shall supersede and replace the prior retention
agreement entered into or offered. Furthermore, Transatlantic shall not take
any further action to enter into any amended and restated retention agreement
(or with respect to a listed individual who is not currently a party to any
retention agreement, cause a new retention agreement to be entered into), the
terms of which would be applicable in the event of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in the
event that the employment of an employee of Transatlantic who is listed on
Section 6.10 of the Transatlantic Disclosure Schedule and did not execute his
or her retention agreement prior to the date hereof is terminated without
Cause prior to the Effective Time, such employee shall be entitled to the
same treatment as if such employee had executed a retention agreement which
had been mutually agreed by Alleghany and Transatlantic pursuant to this
Section 6.10. Pursuant to this Section 6.10, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company hereby agrees to assume and becomes the successor
to the rights and obligations of Transatlantic under any agreements that are
outstanding on or before the date hereof the amended and restated retention
agreements and the such other retention agreements entered into between
Transatlantic and its employees on or before the date hereof (or, thereafter,
to the extent permitted by this Agreement) without the need for further action
on the part of the Surviving Company or the parties to any such agreement.

this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations
of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of

Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject
to the right reserved in this Article.

_ARTICLE VIII_

 

Section 1\. _Elimination of Certain Liability of Directors_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph shall not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing
hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal
or modification.

Section 2\. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a
person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including
service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified

 



-3-   and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid
or to be paid in settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) reasonably incurred
or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
provided in paragraph (b) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this
Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by
the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment of such
expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as
a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or
is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or
otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of the Board, provide
indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope
and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. 

 



-4-  (b) _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under paragraph (a) of
this Section is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after
a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It
shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce
a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been
tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of
conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

(c)  _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the
payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 



-5-  (d) _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.
