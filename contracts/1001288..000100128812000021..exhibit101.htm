last five (5) years. Subject to the requirements of the Code, ERISA and other
applicable Law, each of the Employee Benefit Plans can be terminated or
amended at will by Company or an ERISA Affiliate with no penalty, acceleration
of vesting (other than as required by Section 411(d)(3) of the Code in
connection with a termination or partial termination of any plan intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code) or required payment (other than

22  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  


 and customary expenses and, where applicable, payment of benefits associated
with the termination of benefit plans).

contract, or fund) has been maintained, funded and administered in all

and may still obtain a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service; or (D) with respect to a plan that is within the remedial
amendment period and has not yet obtained a favorable determination letter, to
Company's Knowledge, there exists no circumstances that would preclude the
issuance of a favorable determination letter by the Internal Revenue Service;

Fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan has any Liability for breach of
fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit Plan.

administration or the investment of the assets of any such Employee 
  
 

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

23

administrative forms and other documents that constitute a part of or are
incident to the administration of the Employee Benefit Plans. To Company's
Knowledge, no unwritten amendment exists with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan. Except as set forth on Schedule 4(r)(i)(F), there is no plan or
commitment, whether legally binding or not, to establish any new Employee
Benefit Plan, or to modify or to terminate any Employee Benefit Plan (except
to the extent required by law or as required by this Agreement), nor, to
Company's Knowledge, has any intention to do any of the foregoing been
communicated to any employee of Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

  

  

(G) None of the Employee Benefit Plans is subject to the requirements of

nor any ERISA Affiliate is or ever has been obligated to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan, nor has Company or any ERISA Affiliate incurred any
Liability (including withdrawal liability as defined in ERISA ยง4201) under or
with respect to any Multiemployer Plan. Neither Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or has any
Liability under or with respect to any Employee Pension Benefit Plan that is a
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA ยง3(35)). No asset of Company or
any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any Lien, other than Permitted Liens, under
ERISA or the Code on account of an Employee Benefit Plan.

Affiliate has incurred any Liability under Sections 4980B or 4980D of the
Code.

an obligation to contribute to, or, to Company's Knowledge, has any Liability
that could have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to, any Employee
Welfare Benefit Plan or other arrangement providing health or life insurance
or other welfare-type benefits for current or future retired or terminated
directors, officers or employees (or any spouse or other dependent thereof) of
Company or of any other Person other than in accordance with COBRA (and any
similar state statute or foreign law with respect to each Employee Benefit
Plan that is in a "group health plan" (as defined in Section 5000(b)(i) of the
Code or any similar state statute or foreign law)).

  

  

(ii) Except as required under applicable Law in connection with qualified plan
amendments required by tax law changes, the vesting of accrued benefits under
any Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code
as a result of termination of 
 

 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

 


 that plan or the termination of any Company Equity Plan as contemplated by
this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not: (i) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount, of compensation due to any employee, officer, former employee or
former officer of Company or any ERISA Affiliate; or (ii) result in the
triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the right of
Company or any ERISA Affiliate or the Buyer to amend or terminate any Employee
Benefit Plan. No amount that will be received (whether in cash or property or
vesting of property), or benefit provided to, any officer, director or
employee of Company or any ERISA Affiliate who is a "disqualified individual"
(as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement
or benefit plan currently in effect as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be an "excess parachute payment" (as such
term is defined in section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) solely as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and no such Person is entitled to
receive any additional payment from Company or any ERISA Affiliate in the
event that the excise tax of Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such
Person.

  

  

(iii) Schedule 4(r)(iii) lists each Employee Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Treasury

compensation plan (i) was operated in all material respects in compliance with
Code Section 409A between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008, based upon a
good faith, reasonable interpretation of (A) Code Section 409A or (B) guidance
issued by the IRS thereunder (including IRS Notice 2005-1), to the extent
applicable and effective (clauses (A) and (B), together, the "409A
Authorities"), (ii) has been operated in all material respects in compliance
with the 409A Authorities and the final Treasury Regulations issued thereunder
since January 1, 2009, and (iii) has been in documentary compliance in all
material respects with the 409A Authorities and the final Treasury Regulations
issued thereunder since January 1, 2009. Neither Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has any obligation to reimburse or otherwise "gross-up" any Person
for the interest or additional tax set forth under Code ยง409A(a)(1)(B).

  

  

(iv) Sellers maintain the requisite authority, and have taken or will take
pursuant to Section 5(g) hereof all action necessary to exercise the requisite
authority, to cancel all outstanding rights of all Optionholders in such
Company Options by delivery of the Optionholder Payment following Closing.

Requirements.

Section 5. Post-Closing Covenants. The Parties agree as follows with respect
to the period following the Closing.

  

  

(a) General. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the
requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Section 6(b)
below).

  

  

(b) Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any Party actively is
contesting or defending against any third-party action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with
(i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or
prior to the Closing involving Company, each of the other Parties shall
reasonably cooperate with it and its counsel in the defense or contest, make
available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books
and records as shall reasonably be necessary in connection with the defense or
contest, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party
(unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under Section 6(b) below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if one of
the Parties is pursuing or contesting, or if in the opinion of

   
 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 


 counsel may reasonably pursue or contest, a claim for indemnification
related to such action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge,
complaint, claim, or demand described in the preceding sentence, the
obligations of the preceding sentence shall not apply.

  

  

(c) Payment of Taxes.

  

  

(i) Taxes on Securities. Any Tax attributable to the sale or transfer of
Securities shall be equally shared by Buyer and Sellers. Sellers and Buyer
agree to timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be
necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce),
or file Tax Returns with respect to, such Taxes.

  

  

(ii) Tax Indemnification. Sellers and Company shall indemnify Buyer and hold
them harmless from and against, any loss, claim, Liability, expense, or other
damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of Company
required to be paid in accordance with applicable Tax returns and Laws for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through
the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (ii) all Taxes of any member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Company (or
any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation ยง1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar law or regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any
Person (other than Company) imposed on Company as a transferee or successor,
by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to
an event or transaction occurring before the Closing (collectively a "Tax
Claim"). Any Tax Claims by the Buyer for indemnification under this Section
5(c)(ii) shall follow the procedures for indemnification as described in
Sections 6(c) and 6(d). Any such Tax Claims shall be payable, if required to
be paid in accordance with the procedures for indemnification as described in
Sections 6(c) and 6(d), first out of the remaining balance of the Escrow
Account. Each Seller shall be severally (but not jointly) liable for any such
Tax Claims required to be paid in accordance with this Section 5(c)(ii) in
excess of the remaining balance of the Escrow Account in an amount equal to
such Seller's pro rata share, which shall be determined based on the quotient
obtained by dividing the aggregate consideration payable to such Seller
pursuant to Section 2(c) by the Purchase Price; provided, however, that in no
event shall the amount payable by any Seller therefor exceed the proceeds
actually received by such Seller in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(iii) Sellers' Returns. Sellers shall timely and accurately prepare and file
with the appropriate Governmental Authorities any Tax Returns with respect to
the Company for taxable periods of the Company that end on or before December
31, 2011 that are due prior to the Closing Date (the "Sellers' Returns"). Each
Seller shall be severally (but not jointly) liable for and pay, and shall
indemnify each of Company and Buyer against and hold each of them harmless
from the Taxes due on the Sellers' Returns in accordance with Section 5(c)(ii)
above. In the event a Seller Return is provided to the Company for filing,
Sellers shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the Taxes as shown on the
Seller Return not later than two business days before the due date (including
any extensions for payment) for payment of Taxes with respect to such Seller
Return, and the Buyer shall cause the Company to timely file such Seller
Return and pay (subject to indemnification provided in Section 5(c)(ii) above)
the Tax shown as due thereon.

  

  

(iv) Buyer Returns. The Buyer shall timely prepare and file (or cause such
preparation and filing) with the appropriate Governmental Authorities any Tax
Returns required to be filed by Company with respect to a taxable period
beginning before or after December 31, 
 

 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 2011 that are due after the Closing Date other than Sellers' Returns (the
"Buyer Returns"). If any Tax shown as due on such Buyer Return includes any
Pre-Closing Taxes (as defined below) or could otherwise be reasonably expected
to affect the Tax liability of Sellers (taking into account the
indemnification obligations of Stockholders hereunder), the Buyer shall
provide Sellers' Representative with copies of any Buyer Returns at least 15
days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any extensions) (or, if
required to be filed within 15 days after the Closing Date, as soon as
possible following the Closing Date) accompanied by a statement (the "Pre-
Closing Tax Statement") setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the
Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due on the Buyer Return. If the Sellers'
Representative agrees with the Buyer Return and Pre-Closing Tax Statement, the
Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes as shown
on the Pre-Closing Tax Statement not later than two Business Days before the
due date (including any extensions) for payment of Taxes with respect to such
Buyer Return. If, within 10 days of the receipt of the Buyer Return and Pre-
Closing Tax Statement, the Sellers' Representative notifies the Buyer that it
disputes the manner of preparation of the Buyer Return or the amount of Pre-
Closing Taxes calculated in the Pre-Closing Tax Statement, and provides the
Buyer its proposed form of Buyer Return, a statement setting forth and
calculating in reasonable detail the Pre-Closing Taxes, and a written
explanation of the reasons for its adjustment, then the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall attempt to resolve their disagreement within the five
days following Sellers' Representative's notification to the Buyer of such
disagreement. If the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative are unable to
resolve their disagreement, the dispute shall be submitted to a nationally
recognized accounting firm that neither Buyer or the Company has used within
the last two years or is otherwise mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers
(the "Arbitrator"), whose expense shall be borne equally by the Buyer on the
one hand, and Sellers on the other, for resolution within 10 days of such
submission. The decision of the Arbitrator with respect to such dispute shall
be binding upon Buyer and Sellers, and Sellers shall pay to the Company an
amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes as decided by the Arbitrator not later
than two business days before the due date (including any extensions) for
payment of Taxes with respect to such Buyer Return.

  

  

(v) Straddle Period and Pre-Closing Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Taxes with respect to any Tax Return with respect to the
Company for a taxable period ending after the Closing Date that includes the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Taxes that
constitutes "Pre-Closing Taxes" shall (a) in the case of Taxes that are either
(x) based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection
with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) or other
reasonably identifiable transaction be deemed equal to the amount that would
be payable if the Tax period ended at the close of business on the date of the
Closing and (b) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause
(a)) imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the
Target, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including
net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be
allocated under this Section shall be computed by reference to the level of
such items at the close of business on the Closing Date. The parties shall, to
the extent permitted by Law, elect with the relevant Governmental Entity to
treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short Tax period ending as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. 
  
 

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

 

  


  
 

(vi) Reimbursement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Sellers or
Buyer, as the case may be, shall provide, without limitation, reimbursement
for any Tax paid by one party all or a portion of which is the responsibility
of the other party in accordance with the terms of this Section. Not later
than 10 days prior to the payment of any said Tax (or, if required to be paid
within 10 days after the Closing Date, as soon as possible following the
Closing Date), the party paying such Tax shall give notice to the other party
of the Tax payable and the portion which is the liability of each party,
although failure to provide such notice will not relieve the other party from
its liability hereunder.

  

  

(vii) Tax Contest. Any Party who receives any notice of a pending or
threatened Tax audit, assessment, or adjustment against or with respect to the
Company which may give rise to liability of any other party hereto, shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto within five business days of the
receipt of such notice. Such notice shall contain factual information
describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such audit, assessment or adjustment. Failure to
give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under
this Section except to the extent the indemnifying party (the "Tax
Indemnifying Party") shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure
(except that the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any expenses
incurred during the period in which the Tax Indemnified Party (as defined
below) failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the party who is entitled to
indemnification hereunder (the "Tax Indemnified Party") shall deliver to the
Tax Indemnifying Party, as promptly as possible but in no event later than ten
days after the Tax Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all relevant
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Tax Indemnified
Party. The parties each agree to consult with and to keep the other parties
informed on a regular basis regarding the status of any Tax audit or
proceeding to the extent that such audit or proceeding could affect a
liability of such other parties or their affiliates (including indemnity
obligations hereunder), and provide the other party with copies of all written
correspondence with respect to such audit or proceeding in a timely manner. In
the case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding relating solely
to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, Sellers shall have
the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding.
The Buyer shall have the right to participate in such proceeding at its own
expense, and shall be entitled to control the disposition of any issue
involved in such proceeding which does not affect a potential obligation of
Sellers (including the Sellers' obligation to indemnify Buyer). If Sellers do
not timely take control of such audit or proceeding, the Buyer may, at the
cost and expense of Sellers, control the conduct of the audit or proceeding.
Both Buyer and Sellers shall be entitled to represent their own interests in
light of their responsibilities (including indemnity obligations) for the
related Taxes, at their own expense, in any audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding involving any Taxes with respect to any Tax Return of the
Company for a Straddle Period, and no such audit or proceeding may be settled
or compromised by Buyer or Sellers without the consent of both Buyer and
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  

  

(viii) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(A) Buyer, Company, and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 5(c) and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided

 

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

 


   


 hereunder. Company and Sellers agree (i) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii)
to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so
requests, Company or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party
to take possession of such books and records.

  

  

(B) Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

(C) Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to provide the other Party
with all information in such Party's possession, custody or control that
either Party may be required to report pursuant to Code ยง6043, or Code ยง6043A,
or United States Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(ix) Certain Taxes and Fees. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes,
and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by Buyer when due, and Buyer will, at their own expense, file all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and
charges, and, if required by applicable law, Sellers will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any Tax Returns and other
documentation.

  

  

(d) Employee Matters.

  

  

(i) Employees. The parties intend that there will be a continuity of
employment for all Company employees immediately following the Closing at not
lower than their current compensation, benefits and responsibility levels;
provided, however, that the parties do not intend to modify the employment
status of any Company employees from being that of at-will employment.

  

  

(ii) Obligations of Buyer; Comparability of Benefits. Buyer shall maintain, or
shall cause the Company to maintain, all Employee Benefit Plans and other
employment-related obligations and agreements with respect to any current or
former employees of Company ("Company Employees") without material increase to
such Company Employees contribution amounts, provided, however, that nothing
herein shall preclude Buyer or Company from amending, modifying, suspending or
terminating any or all Employee Benefit Plans or other employment-related
obligations or agreements with respect to any Company Employees in its
discretion at any time, provided, further, that prior to December 31, 2012,
such amendment, modification, suspension or termination shall not materially
reduce in the aggregate the benefits provided to Company Employees as of
immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall also cause the Company to pay
the incentive payments to the Company Employees as described on Schedule 4(g).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing within this paragraph shall require the
Buyer to maintain any Employee Benefit Plans or other employment-related
obligations and agreements

 

 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

 

  

providing Company Employees with equity rights in either the Company, the
Buyer or its Affiliates.

  

 

  

(iii) Pre-Existing Limitations; Service Credit. With respect to any Employee
Benefit Plans of Buyer or its Affiliates in which Company Employees
participate, after the Closing and except as otherwise provided under any
restricted stock unit agreements (e.g., vesting) granted to Company Employees
on or after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause Company or such
Affiliates to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Company Employees to the extent such limitations
were waived or otherwise satisfied under the comparable Employee Benefit
Plans, and (ii) recognize all regular employee service of Company Employees
with Company and its current and former Affiliates for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting, form of payment and calculation of the rate of
benefits (if applicable) relating to service after the Closing, but not (A) to
the extent such recognition would result in duplication of benefits or (B) for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or equity
plan, and only to the same extent such service would be taken into account
under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(iv) Buyer shall be solely responsible for any Liabilities arising out of the
employment or termination of employment of any Company Employees following the
Closing, including lawsuits, actions, claims or proceedings and accrued
obligations for salaries, wages and other compensation payable after the
Closing, personal days and floating holidays and sick pay of such Company
Employees and any Liabilities arising under, in connection with or in respect
of the Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(e) Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification.

  

  

(i) After the Closing, Buyer shall cause Company to continue to provide, for a
period of not less than six years after the Closing, to any Person who is or
was an officer or director of Target, GP or the Company Subsidiaries,
officers' and directors' liability insurance coverage ("DandO Insurance") with
respect to all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including attorney's fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened action,
suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each a "DandO Claim") to the extent
that any such DandO Claim is based on, or arises out of, (a) the fact that such
Person is or was a director or officer of Target, GP or the Company
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing Date or (b) this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in each case to the
extent that any such DandO Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising,
existing, or occurring prior to or at the Closing Date, regardless of whether
such DandO Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date,
which coverage will to the extent commercially available, be substantially
similar to Target's, GP's or the Company Subsidiaries' existing DandO Insurance,
including (x) an overall coverage amount not less than the overall coverage
amount under Target's, GP's or the Company Subsidiaries' existing DandO
Insurance and (y) coverage for liability under the Securities Act and
Securities Exchange Act in an amount not less than the coverage amounts for
such liabilities under Target's, GP's or the Company Subsidiaries' existing
DandO Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Buyer may purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' insurance and
indemnification policy under Company's existing DandO Insurance. Any such "tail"
directors' and officers' insurance and indemnification policy will satisfy
Buyer's obligation under this Section 5(e)(i) to provide DandO Insurance.

  

   
 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

 

 

(ii) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit Target, GP or the Company Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or
modify any provision in any of Target's, GP's or the Company Subsidiaries'
Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any
officers or directors, if such amendment or modification would materially and
adversely affect the current (as of the date hereof) beneficiaries thereof, it
being the intent of the parties hereto that the officers and directors of
Target, GP and the Company Subsidiaries on the date hereof shall continue to
be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the
Law.

  

  

(f) Confidentiality. Unless required by law or the rules and regulations of
any securities exchange (in which case each of Buyer and Sellers shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party prior to any such
disclosure as to the form and content of such disclosure) as reasonably
determined by a Party's counsel, from and after the date hereof, no press
releases, announcements to the employees, customers or suppliers of the
Business or other releases of information related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby will be issued or released without the prior
consent of both Buyer and Sellers. Sellers and Buyer agree to keep the terms
of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent required by applicable
law or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange, or for financial
reporting purposes, as reasonably determined by such Party's counsel and
advisors, and except that the parties may disclose such terms to their
respective employees, accountants, advisors and other representatives as
necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses (so long as such Persons agree to or are bound by Contract to keep
the terms of this Agreement confidential). The Confidentiality Agreement
between the Sellers and Buyer dated November 10, 2011 shall remain in full
force and effect pursuant to its terms.

  

  

(g) Paying Agent.

  

  

(i) LITSA hereby agrees to serve as Paying Agent, upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 5(g).

  

  

(ii) At the Closing, LITSA, in its capacity as Paying Agent, shall hold in
trust for the Optionholders the Optionholder Payment in accordance with
Section 2(c)(ii) above.

  

  

(iii) Upon receipt of the Optionholder Acknowledgments, LITSA shall make
payment to such Optionholders in the amounts set forth on Schedule 2(c)(ii)
(subject to any withholding obligations) by issuance of check (or direct
deposit or wire transfer) in the normal payroll process of Company or, if not
through the payroll process of Company, within such time that the normal
payroll process of Company would have disbursed such payments after receipt of
such Optionholder Acknowledgments.

  

  

(iv) LITSA, directly or through the Company, shall distribute to each
Optionholder its pro rata share of any amounts released from the Escrow Fund
or the Sellers' Representative Account for the benefit of the Optionholders.

  

  

(v) LITSA, directly or through the Company, shall prepare and file with the
appropriate Governmental Authority and Seller or Optionholder all appropriate
tax information and withholding forms covering any distributions made by it
pursuant to this Section 5(g).

  

  

Section 6. Remedies for Breaches of This Agreement.

  

  

(a) Survival of Representations and Warranties. All of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3(a), Section 3(b), and Section 4 above and
the covenants contained in this

 

 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 Agreement shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force and
effect for a period of eighteen (18) months thereafter (and thereafter to the
extent a claim is made prior to such expiration with respect to any breach of
such representation or warranty, covenant or other obligation until such claim
is finally determined or settled); provided, that the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3(a)(i), 3(a)(iv), 3(b)(ii) and 4(a), 4(b),
4(k), 4(r), and 4(s) shall survive and continue in full force and effect until
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(and thereafter to the extent a claim is made prior to such expiration with
respect to any breach of such representation or warranty until such claim is
finally determined or settled).

  

 

  

(b) Indemnification.

  

  

(i) By Sellers. Subject to Section 6(a) above, Sellers hereby agree to,
severally, and not jointly, indemnify and hold Buyer (following the Closing
Date), and its Affiliates, attorneys, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless at
all times from and against any Adverse Consequences arising from: (A) subject
to the immediately following sentence, any breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3(a) made by Sellers in this Agreement; (B)
any breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4 made
by Company in this Agreement and (C) any breach of the covenants or agreements
made by Sellers in this Agreement (collectively the "Sellers' Indemnifiable
Obligations"). With respect to the indemnification obligations under clauses
(A) and (C) above, each Seller shall only be responsible to the extent the
breach at issue related to such Seller. With respect to the indemnification
obligation under clause (B) above, each Seller shall be responsible for its
pro rata share, which shall be determined based on the quotient obtained by
dividing the aggregate consideration payable to such Seller pursuant to
Section 2(c) by the Purchase Price. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, no current or former stockholder, equity holder, director, officer,
employee, affiliate or advisor of Company shall have any personal or
individual liability of any nature to the Buyer Indemnified Parties with
respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
set forth in, or any other breach of, this Agreement; provided, however, the
foregoing shall not prevent Buyer from bringing a common law action for actual
fraud with intent to deceive against any Person whose own such fraud has
caused Buyer to incur Adverse Consequences or limit the Adverse Consequences
recoverable by Buyer in such common law action, provided that no Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover more than once for the same
Damages. For purposes of clarification, any and all indemnity by Sellers for
Taxes of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period is addressed
exclusively in Section 5(c)(ii) above.

  

  

(ii) By Buyer. Following the Closing, Buyer, shall indemnify and hold Sellers
and their Affiliates, attorneys, representative, successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless at all times
from and after the Closing Date against and in respect of Adverse Consequences
arising from or relating to: (A) any breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3(b) made by Buyer in this Agreement; and (B)
any breach of any covenant and agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement
(collectively the "Buyer's Indemnifiable Obligations").

  

  

(iii) Limitations of Indemnity. In no event shall the amount payable under
Section 6(b)(i) exceed $18,750,000 (the "Cap"); provided, however, that the
Cap shall not be applicable for any breaches of Sections 3(a)(i), 3(a)(iv),
4(a), 4(b), 4(k), 4(r), or 4(s) (collectively, the "Fundamental
Representations"). In no event shall the amount payable by any Seller with
respect to the Fundamental Representations exceed the proceeds actually
received by such Seller in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The amount payable under Section 6(b)(i) for
breaches of the representations and warranties in Section 4(k) is

   
 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

 

  


  
 


  limited to Adverse Consequences arising out of a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
There shall be no limitation on any Liability to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party for any Adverse Consequences suffered as a result of willful
misconduct or actual fraud with the intent to deceive.

  

  

(iv) Recovery of Indemnity. The amounts due to Buyer pursuant to Sellers'
Indemnifiable Obligations under Section 6(b)(i) shall not be payable until
Buyer has suffered Adverse Consequences in excess of $350,000 in the aggregate
(the "Basket"), at which point Sellers will be obligated to indemnify Buyer
from and against all such Adverse Consequences suffered in excess of the
Basket. Buyer shall first recover any amounts pursuant to Sellers'
Indemnifiable Obligations from the Escrow Fund prior to seeking recovery
directly from any Seller.

  

  

(v) Determination of Damages. For the sole purpose of determining Adverse
Consequences (and not for determining whether any breach pursuant to this
Section 6(b) has occurred), the determination shall be made without regard to
any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers.

  

  

(vi) WAIVER. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS SECTION 6 TO THE CONTRARY,
FOLLOWING THE CLOSING, NO PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATE SHALL BE LIABLE TO ANY BUYER
INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR EXEMPLARY LOSSES OR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR
DIMINUTION IN VALUE, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY
FORESEEABLE, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES INCLUDED IN
A THIRD PARTY CLAIM AS TO WHICH A PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION
PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 6.

  

  

(vii) Exclusive Remedy. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions in this
Section 6 shall be the exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and
the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to all claims arising under or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for
claims of actual fraud with intent to deceive and for Tax matters described in
Section 5(c)(ii) and injunctive relief as may be necessary to enforce Section
5(f). After the Closing Date, no Party or its Affiliates may seek the
rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(viii) Subrogation and Mitigation. After any indemnification payment is made
pursuant to this Section 6, the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of
such payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Party
against any third party in connection with the Adverse Consequences to which
such payment relates. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, any Indemnified Party receiving an indemnification payment pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall execute, upon the written request of the
Indemnifying Party, any instrument reasonably necessary to evidence such
subrogation rights. The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate the consequences of any breach.

  

  

(ix) Net Recovery. The amount of any Adverse Consequences that are subject to
indemnification under this Section 6 shall be calculated net of the amount of
any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements received or receivable by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in
connection with such Adverse Consequences or any of the events or
circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Adverse Consequences.
The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Adverse
Consequences to the same extent

   
  
 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

 


 as they would be entitled to seek if such Adverse Consequences were not
subject to indemnification hereunder.

  

  

(c) Procedures for Indemnification

  

  

(i) If any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (each an
"Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion by any third party of
any claim or of the commencement by any such third party of any action (a
"Third Party Claim") with respect to which any other Party to this Agreement
(an "Indemnifying Party") is or may be obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party
in writing of the Third Party Claim, which notice shall also set forth a
detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Third
Party Claim and the aggregate dollar amount of the Adverse Consequences being
claimed with respect to the Third Party Claim (the "Claim Notice"); provided,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve or otherwise affect
the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to provide indemnification hereunder,
except to the extent that any Liabilities directly resulted from or were
caused by such failure, or the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

  

  

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Claim Notice (unless the claim or action requires a response before the
expiration of such thirty-day period, in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall have until five (5) days before the required response date) to
undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, and at
its expense from the Escrow Fund, the settlement or defense of the Third Party
Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
in connection therewith; provided, that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense
through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party, provided that the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall not be borne by the Indemnifying Party, (ii)
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Party's consent if the settlement requires the Indemnified Party
to admit wrongdoing, pay any fines or refrain from any action and (iii) if, in
the written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
has separate defenses from the Indemnifying Party and there is a conflict of
interest between the Indemnified and Indemnifying Parties or if there is any
danger of criminal Liability of the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall be permitted to retain special counsel of its own choosing at the
sole expense of the Indemnified Party.

  

  

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice (or before the date that is
five (5) days before the required response date, if the claim or action
requires a response before the expiration of such thirty (30) day period) that
it elects to undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim described therein,
subject to the survival periods (Section 6(a)), limits on Sellers'
Indemnifiable Obligations (Section 6(b)) and other provisions set forth in
this Section 6, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest the
Third Party Claim in the exercise of its reasonable discretion at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party is
undertaking the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 6(c)(ii)
above, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such claim without the
Indemnifying Party's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided that it shall not constitute an unreasonable withholding of
such consent if the settlement of a Third Party Claim does not include a full,
complete and irrevocable release for the benefit of the Indemnifying Party.

  

   
  
 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

 

(iv) Subject to Section 6(d) with respect to claims against the Escrow Fund, a
claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may
be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought.

  

  

(d) Claims Against and Release of Escrow Funds.

  

  

(i) For purposes of securing Sellers' Indemnifiable Obligations, on the
Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent to
be held in accordance with this Section 6(d) and the Escrow Agreement. Upon
Buyer's determination that any Buyer Indemnified Party has suffered Adverse
Consequences, Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers' Representative and the
Escrow Agent in writing, which notice shall also set forth: (i) the specific
provision alleged to have been breached by Company or Sellers; (ii) a detailed
description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach
of such provision; and (iii) the aggregate dollar amount of the Adverse
Consequences being claimed with respect to the breach referred to in such
notice (the "Escrow Claim Notice"). Unless within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Escrow Claim Notice, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall receive a
written objection from Sellers' Representative regarding the Escrow Claim
Notice, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from the
Escrow Fund the amount set forth in the Escrow Claim Notice, and the Escrow
Agent shall distribute such amount to Buyer Indemnified Party within five (5)
days thereafter. In the event Sellers' Representative shall timely object in
writing to the Escrow Claim Notice, the Escrow Agent shall make no
disbursements from the Escrow Fund relating to such Escrow Claim Notice unless
and until Buyer and Sellers shall have resolved any claim set forth in a
disputed Escrow Claim Notice by mutual agreement or litigation. Buyer and
Sellers agree to act in good faith to resolve any disputed Escrow Claim
Notice.

  

  

(ii) On the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow
Agent shall release to each of the Sellers and Paying Agent (for the benefit
of the Optionholders) the balance of any remaining Escrow Fund less any
amounts sufficient to satisfy any then-pending indemnification claim(s)
previously and timely asserted by Buyer pursuant to wire transfer instructions
delivered by each of the Sellers and Company to the Escrow Agent at such time.

  

  

(iii) The Sellers' Representative may withdraw funds from the Escrow Account
to pay for court costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred in
the settlement or defense of a Third Party Claim by Sellers in accordance with
Section 6(c)(ii) above. In order to withdraw such funds, Sellers'
Representative shall notify Buyer and the Escrow Agent in writing of the
amount of such fees and expenses, including a detailed description of the
services provided (the "Fees Notice"). Unless within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of the Fees Notice, Sellers' Representative and the Escrow Agent shall
receive a written objection from Buyer objecting to the reasonableness or
applicability of the fees or expenses, the Sellers' Representative shall be
entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund the amount set forth in the Fees
Notice, and the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount to Sellers'
Representative within five (5) days thereafter. In the event that Buyer shall
timely object in writing to the reasonableness or applicability of the fees or
expenses, the Escrow Agent shall make no disbursements from the Escrow Fund
relating to such Fees Notice unless and until Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall have resolved such dispute by mutual agreement or
litigation. Buyer and Sellers' Representative agree to act in good faith to
resolve any disputed Fees Notice.

  

  

(iv) Buyer may withdraw funds from the Escrow Account to pay for any taxes due
with respect to any income allocated to it with respect to interest earned on
the Escrow Fund. In order to withdraw such funds, Buyer shall notify Sellers'
Representative and the Escrow Agent in writing of the amount of such amount
necessary to pay the taxes due with respect to such interest

   
 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

 


  (the "Interest Notice"). Unless within fifteen (15) days after receipt of
the Interest Notice, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall receive a written
objection from Sellers' Representative objecting to the amount claimed to pay
such taxes, the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount to Buyer within five
(5) days thereafter. In the event that Sellers' Representative shall timely
object in writing to the amount sought to be withdrawn, the Escrow Agent shall
make no disbursements from the Escrow Fund relating to such Interest Notice
unless and until Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall have resolved such
dispute by mutual agreement or litigation. Buyer and Sellers' Representative
agree to act in good faith to resolve any disputed Interest Notice; further,
Sellers' Representative agrees not to object to the Interest Notice so long as
the payment sought by Buyer is not greater than 35% of the amount allocated by
the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(e) Sellers' Representative.

  

  

(i) Vista Equity Fund II L.P. shall be constituted and appointed as
representative ("Sellers' Representative") for and on behalf of the Sellers to
give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Buyer of
the cash or other property from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by
Buyer, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to consent or
agree to any amendment to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and to take
all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers'
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without
having to seek or obtain the consent of any other Person. No bond shall be
required of the Sellers' Representative, and the Sellers' Representative shall
receive no compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from
the Sellers' Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Sellers.

  

  

(ii) Each of the Sellers irrevocably appoints the Sellers' Representative as
the agent, proxy and attorney in fact for such Seller for all purposes of this
Agreement, including full power and authority on such Seller's behalf (a) to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (b) to pay expenses (whether
incurred on or after the date hereof) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement, (c) to disburse any funds
received hereunder to such Seller and each other Seller and Optionholder, (d)
to execute and deliver on behalf of such Seller any amendment or waiver
hereto, (e) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such
Seller in connection herewith, (f) to negotiate, settle, compromise and
otherwise handle any claims for indemnification or made pursuant this
Agreement hereof, and (g) to do each and every act and exercise any and all
rights which such Seller is, or Sellers collectively are, permitted or
required to do or exercise under this Agreement. The Sellers' Representative
hereby agrees to act on behalf of the Sellers, and accepts the appointment by
each such Seller to act on its behalf, as provided herein. The appointment of
the Sellers' Representative shall be coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable by any Seller in any manner or for any reason. The Sellers'
Representative shall promptly notify Buyer in the event of its replacement by
another Sellers' Representative.

  

  

(iii) The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Sellers' Representative while acting in good faith,
without willful misconduct, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice
of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Sellers shall
severally (on a pro rata basis according to their respective interests in the
Escrow Fund) indemnify the Sellers' Representative and hold it harmless
against any loss, Liability or expense incurred without willful misconduct or
bad faith on the part of the Sellers' Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder.

  

   
  
 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

(iv) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide the Sellers'
Representative with reasonable access to information about the Company and the
reasonable assistance of the officers and employees of Buyer and the Company
for purposes of performing his duties and exercising its rights under this
Agreement, provided that the Sellers' Representative shall treat
confidentially any nonpublic information he receives from Buyer regarding the
Buyer or the Company (except in connection with the performance by the
Sellers' Representative of his duties or the exercise of his rights under this
Agreement).

  

  

(v) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers' Representative
shall constitute a decision of all Sellers and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each Seller, and the Escrow Agent and Buyer may rely upon any
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers' Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every Seller.

  

  

(vi) The Sellers' Representative's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with performing its duties under this Section 6(e) shall first be
funded or reimbursed from the Sellers' Representative Account, and if in
excess of the amount of such Sellers' Representative Account, from the Sellers
and the Optionholders on a pro rata basis, which shall be determined based on
the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate consideration payable to each
such Seller or Optionholder pursuant to Section 2(c) by the Purchase Price.
The Sellers' Representative shall give each Seller and Optionholder a
statement of the current balance of the Sellers' Representative Account,
including descriptions of any additions and withdrawals, upon the request of
any such Seller or Optionholder (but in no event more frequently than
quarterly).

  

  

Section 7. Miscellaneous.

  

  

(a) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Other than with respect to the Optionholders
and except as provided in Sections 5(e) and 6, this Agreement shall not confer
any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

(b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents referred to

prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter
hereof.

subsection of the Agreement to which the information set forth herein relates,
it being understood that any information set forth in one section of the
Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to apply to each other section of the

to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and

 perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases Buyer
nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations hereunder).

(h) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to Delaware's conflicts of law rules.

  

  

(i) Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(i) Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken
from such courts, in any dispute or controversy ("Dispute") arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein,
(ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 5(c), agrees that every such
Dispute shall be brought, heard and determined exclusively in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware

   
 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 


 (provided that, in the event that subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable
in or declined by the Court of Chancery, then all such claims shall be
brought, heard and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from such court, (iv) agrees not to bring any Dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein in
any other court, and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Dispute so brought. The parties further agree, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, that a final and unappealable judgment
against any of them in any Dispute contemplated above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

  

  

(ii) Each of the parties agrees that service of any process, summons, notice
or document by U.S. registered mail to its address set forth in Section 7(g)
shall be effective service of process for any Dispute brought against it;
provided, however, that nothing contained in the foregoing clause shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

  

  

(iii) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO ITS
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 7(i)(iii).

  

  

(j) Conflict Waiver. After the Closing Date, the parties agree that Buyer any
its Affiliates shall not, and after the Closing shall not cause the Company
to, seek to have Hunton and Williams LLP, Kirkland and Ellis LLP and DLA Piper LLP
(US) disqualified from representing the Sellers, the Optionholders and their
respective Affiliates (and hereby waive any conflict of interest that would
otherwise exist in connection with such representation) in connection with any
dispute that may arise between the Sellers and the Optionholders, on the one
hand, and the Buyer, the Company or the Buyer Indemnified Parties, on the
other hand, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (a "Post-Closing Dispute"); provided, that prior to undertaking such
representation, Hunton and Williams LLP, Kirkland and Ellis LLP or DLA Piper LLP
(US), as the case may be, shall provide a letter to Buyer, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, pursuant to which Hunton and
Williams LLP, Kirkland and Ellis LLP or DLA Piper LLP (US) shall agree to take
all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that any lawyer who is representing,
has represented or is reasonably likely in the future to represent Buyer or
any of their Affiliates (other than the Company prior to the Closing) shall
not represent any of the Sellers or Optionholders in any Post-Closing Dispute
and that appropriate and customary information screens are established between
any such two sets of lawyers.

   
 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 


  The parties also agree that, after the Closing Date, as to all
communications between or among Hunton and Williams LLP, Kirkland and Ellis LLP
and DLA Piper LLP (US) and the Sellers and the Optionholders, Target, GP or
the Company Subsidiaries that relate in any way to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the Sellers and the Optionholders
and may be controlled by the Sellers and the Optionholders and shall not pass
to or be claimed or disputed by Buyer or Target, GP or the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates; provided, however, that nothing
herein is intended or shall be construed to constitute an agreement by the
Sellers, the Optionholders, Target, GP or the Company Subsidiaries to waive
any privilege of Target, GP or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any
information or communication that does not relate to any dispute under or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (it being
understood that any privilege of Target, GP or the Company Subsidiaries that
attaches with respect to such other matters will be controlled solely by
Target, GP or the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing Date). Buyer
acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (which, for this purpose,
shall be deemed after the Closing to include Target, GP ant the Company
Subsidiaries) that it has had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate
information concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable
available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of
this Section 7(j), including the opportunity to consult with independent
counsel of its choice.

  

  

(k) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Buyer and
Sellers. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any

ESCROW AGREEMENT

  

  


 

  

  

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT is entered into as of February 29, 2012, by and among
Lexmark International Technology, S.A. ("Purchaser"), Vista Equity Fund II,
L.P. ("Sellers' Representative", and together with Purchaser, sometimes
referred to individually as "Party" and collectively as the "Parties"), and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (the "Escrow Agent").

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed to deposit in escrow certain funds pursuant
to a certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of the same date hereof,
by and among, Purchaser, Lexmark International (Asia), S.a.r.l., the
shareholders of BDGB Enterprise Software (LUX), S.C.A. (the "Sellers"), and
BDGB Enterprise Software GP SARL, dated the same date hereof (the "Purchase
Agreement") and wish such deposit to be subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein. Capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings given to them in the Purchase Agreement, although the
Escrow Agent shall not have any obligation to understand or ascertain the
meaning of any defined terms not defined in this Agreement.

  


 

  

1. Appointment. The Parties hereby appoint Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  


 

  

2. Fund. Purchaser agrees to deposit with Escrow Agent the sum of $11,250,000 ("Escrow Deposit"). Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Deposit and shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Deposit and the proceeds thereof ("Fund") in a JPMorgan Money Market Deposit Account ("MMDA"), or a successor or similar investment offered by Escrow Agent. MMDA have rates of compensation that may vary from time to time based upon market conditions. The Parties recognize and agree that instructions to make any other investment ("Alternative Investment"), must be in writing and executed by an Authorized Representative (as defined in Section 3 below), and shall specify the type and identity of the investments to be purchased and/or sold. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation with respect to any Alternative Investment directed hereunder including without limitation charging any applicable agency fee in connection with each transaction. Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of moneys held in the Fund or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any investment decribed herein, and Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss in an investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Market values, exchange rates and other valuation information (including without limitation, market value, current value or notional value) of any Alternative Investment furnished in any report or statement may be obtained from third party sources and is furnished for the exclusive use of the Parties. Escrow Agent has no responsibility whatsoever to determine the market or other value of any Alternative Investment and makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy of any such valuations or that any values necessarily reflect the proceeds that may be received on the sale of an Alternative Investment. Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of an Authorized Representative of Sellers' Representative to give Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Fund. All interest or other income earned under this Agreement shall be allocated to Purchaser and reported, by Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing authority, on IRS Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income earned from the Escrow Deposit by Purchaser whether or not said income has been distributed during such year. Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate in the absence of proper tax documentation or as required by law, and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities. The Parties hereby represent and warrant to the Escrow Agent that there is no sale or transfer of an United States Real Property Interest as defined under IRC Section 897(c) in the underlying transaction giving rise to this Agreement.

  


 

  

    

3.

  |  

Disposition and Termination. (a) (i) Upon Purchaser's determination that it or
any Buyer Indemnified Party (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) has
suffered Adverse Consequences (as defined in the Purchase Agreement),
Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers' Representative and the Escrow Agent
in writing, which notice shall set forth: (a) the specific provision in the
Purchase Agreement alleged to have been breached; (b) a detailed description
of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach of such
provision; and (c)

   
---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

the aggregate dollar amount of the Adverse Consequences being claimed with
respect to the breach referred to in such notice (the "Escrow Claim Notice").
Unless by 5pm Chicago Time within thirty (30) days after the Escrow Agent's
receipt of the Escrow Claim Notice, the Escrow Agent shall receive a written
objection from Sellers' Representative regarding the Escrow Claim Notice,
Purchaser shall be entitled to recover from the Fund the amount set forth in
the Escrow Claim Notice, and the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount to
Purchaser within five (5) days thereafter. In the event Sellers'
Representative shall timely object in writing to the Escrow Claim Notice, the
Escrow Agent shall make no disbursements from the Fund relating to such Escrow
Claim Notice unless and until Purchaser and Sellers shall have resolved any
claim set forth in a disputed Escrow Claim Notice and it shall have received
(x) joint written instructions executed by Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative, or (y) a final, non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction. An Escrow Claim Notice must be provided to the Escrow
Agent by 5pm Chicago Time of the Business Day prior to the Release Date (as
defined below).

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

On the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Release
Date"), the Escrow Agent shall release to each of the Sellers and the Paying
Agent (for the benefit of Optionholders) the balance of any remaining Fund
less any amounts sufficient to satisfy any then-pending indemnification
claim(s) previously and timely asserted by Purchaser pursuant to wire
instructions delivered by the Sellers' Representative to the Escrow Agent at
such time.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

The Sellers' Representative may withdraw funds from the Fund to pay for court
costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred in the settlement
or defense of a Third Party Claim by Sellers in accordance with Section
6(c)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement. In order to withdraw such funds, Sellers'
Representative shall notify Purchaser and the Escrow Agent in writing of the
amount of such fees and expenses, including a detailed description of the
services provided (the "Fees Notice") and indicate such Section 3(iii) of the
Agreement. Unless by 5pm Chicago Time within fifteen (15) days after the
Escrow Agent's receipt of the Fees Notice, the Escrow Agent shall receive a
written objection from Purchaser objecting to the reasonableness or
applicability of the fees or expenses, the Sellers' Representative shall be
entitled to recover from the Fund the amount set forth in the Fees Notice, and
the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount to Sellers' Representative
within five (5) days thereafter. In the event that Purchaser shall timely
object in writing to the reasonableness or applicability of the fees or
expenses, the Escrow Agent shall make no disbursements from the Fund relating
to such Fees Notice unless and until Purchaser and Sellers shall have resolved
any amounts set forth in a disputed Fees Notice and it shall have received (x)
joint written instructions executed by Purchaser and Sellers' Representative,
or (y) a final, non-appealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iv)

  |  

 

Purchaser may withdraw funds from the Escrow Account to pay for any taxes due
with respect to any income allocated to it with respect to interest earned on
the Escrow Fund. In order to withdraw such funds, Purchaser shall notify
Sellers' Representative and the Escrow Agent in writing of the amount of such
amount necessary to pay the taxes due with respect to such interest (the
"Interest Notice"). Unless by 5pm Chicago Time within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of the Interest Notice, the Escrow Agent shall receive a written
objection from Sellers' Representative objecting to the amount claimed to pay
such taxes, the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount to Purchaser within
five (5) days thereafter. In the event that Sellers' Representative shall
timely object in writing to the amount sought to be withdrawn, the Escrow
Agent shall make no disbursements from the Escrow Fund relating to such
Interest Notice unless and until Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall
have resolved such dispute by mutual agreement or litigation. Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative agree to act in good faith to resolve any disputed
Interest Notice; further, Sellers' Representative agrees not to object to the
Interest Notice so long as the payment sought by Purchaser is not greater than
35% of the amount allocated by the Escrow Agent.

 

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

   (v)  |  

The Escrow Agent shall follow any written instructions jointly executed by an
authorized representative of the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

Any instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in any
way related to the transfer or distribution of the Fund, must be in writing or
set forth in a Portable Document Format ("PDF"), executed by the appropriate
Party or Parties as evidenced by the signatures of the person or persons
signing this Agreement or one of their

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

designated persons as set forth in Schedule 1 (each an "Authorized
Representative"), and delivered to Escrow Agent only by confirmed facsimile or
attached to an email on a Business Day only at the fax number or email address
set forth in Section 8 below. No instruction for or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Fund shall be deemed delivered and effective unless Escrow
Agent actually shall have received it on a Business Day by facsimile or as a
PDF attached to an email only at the fax number or email address set forth in
Section 8 and as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to the Party's or
Parties' transmitting fax number or email address and Escrow Agent has been
able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required
hereunder. Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party or other person for
refraining from acting upon any instruction for or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Fund if delivered to any other fax number or email
address, including but not limited to a valid email address of any employee of
Escrow Agent. The Parties each acknowledge that Escrow Agent is authorized to
use the following funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to
Party A and/or Party B, respectively, without a verifying call-back as set
forth in Section 3(b) below:

  


 

  


 

  

Purchaser: Bank name: Sellers' Representative:

(b) In the event any other funds transfer instructions are set forth in a
permitted instruction from a Party or the Parties in accordance with Section
3(a), Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such funds transfer
instructions by a single telephone call-back to one of the Authorized
Representatives, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be that Authorized Representative. The persons and telephone
numbers designated for call-backs may be changed only in a writing executed by
Authorized Representatives of the applicable Party and actually received by
Escrow Agent via facsimile or PDF attached to an e-mail to the fax number or
e-mail address set forth in Section 8. Except as set forth in Section 3(a)
above, no funds will be disbursed until an Authorized Representative is able
to confirm such instructions by telephone callback. Escrow Agent and the
beneficiary\'s bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account
numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the Parties and confirmed
by an Authorized Representative.

  


 

  

(c) The Parties acknowledge that there are certain security, corruption,
transmission error and access availability risks associated with using open
networks such as the Internet and the Parties hereby expressly assume such
risks.

  


 

  

(d) As used in this Section 3, "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which Escrow Agent located at the notice
address set forth below is authorized or required by law or executive order to
remain closed. The Parties acknowledge that the security procedures set forth
in this Section 3 are commercially reasonable. Upon delivery of the entire
balance of the Fund by Escrow Agent, this Agreement shall terminate, subject
to the provisions of Section 7.

  


 

  

4. Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no other duties shall be implied. Escrow Agent has no knowledge of, nor any requirement to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement between the Parties, nor shall Escrow Agent be required to determine if any Party has complied with any other agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of any other agreement between the Parties, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control the actions of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may conclusively rely upon any written notice, document, instruction or request delivered by the Parties believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed by an Authorized Representative(s), as applicable, without inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind and Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

to be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that Escrow Agent\'s
gross negligence or willful misconduct was the cause of any direct loss to
either Party. Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of
its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents. In the event
Escrow Agent receives instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto
which conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, or if Escrow Agent
receives conflicting instructions from the Parties, Escrow Agent shall either
(a) refrain from taking any action until it shall be given a joint written
direction executed by Authorized Representatives of the Parties which
eliminates such conflict or by a final court order or (b) file an action in
interpleader. Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which
may be due it or the Fund, including, without limitation, the Escrow Deposit
nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify
the accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited with it hereunder.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall
Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or
consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited
to lost profits), even if Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of
such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

  


 

  

5. Resignation; Succession. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the Parties. Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to hold the Fund (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, appointed by the Parties, or such other person designated by the Parties, or in accordance with the directions of a final court order, at which time of delivery, Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. If prior to the effective resignation date, the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent, or to instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the Fund to another person as provided above, at any time on or after the effective resignation date, Escrow Agent either (a) may interplead the Fund with a court of competent jurisdiction; or (b) appoint a successor escrow agent of it own choice. Any appointment of a successor escrow agent shall be binding upon the Parties and no appointed successor escrow agent shall be deemed to be an agent of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall deliver the Fund to any appointed successor escrow agent, at which time Escrow Agent's obligations under this Agreement shall cease and terminate. Any entity into which Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

  


 

  

6. Compensation. The Parties agree that Buyer shall pay Escrow Agent upon execution of this Agreement the compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder as described in Schedule 2.

  


 

  

7. Indemnification and Reimbursement. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers' Representative, on the other, shall severally and not jointly indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or reimburse Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (the "Indemnitees") from and against one-half, with respect to the Purchaser, and one-half with respect to the Seller's Representative, of any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively "Losses"), arising out of or in connection with (a) Escrow Agent's performance of this Agreement, except to the extent that such Losses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction through a final order to have been caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bad faith of such Indemnitee; and (b) Escrow Agent's following any instructions or directions, whether joint or singular, from the Parties received in accordance with this Agreement. The obligations set forth in this Section 7 shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

  


 

  

8. Notices. All communications hereunder shall be in writing or set forth in a PDF attached to an email, and all instructions from a Party or the Parties to the Escrow Agent shall be executed by an Authorized Representative, and shall be delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement by facsimile, email or overnight courier only to the appropriate fax number, email address, or notice address set forth for each party as follows:

9. Compliance with Court Orders. In the event that any of the Fund shall be attached, garnished, levied upon, or otherwise be subject to any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all such orders so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the event that Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order it shall not be liable to any of the Parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such order be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

  


 

  

10. Miscellaneous. The provisions of this Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented only by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent and each of the Parties. Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior consent of Escrow Agent and the other Party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each Party and Escrow Agent irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of Illinois. To the extent that in any jurisdiction either Party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its assets, immunity from suit, execution, attachment (before or 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

after judgment) or other legal process, such Party shall not claim, and hereby
irrevocably waives, such immunity. Escrow Agent and the Parties further hereby
waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial
proceeding arising or relating to this Agreement. No party to this Agreement
is liable to any other party for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform
its obligations under the terms of this Agreement because of, acts of God,
fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or
transmission failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. This
Agreement and any joint instructions from the Parties, may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument or instruction, as
applicable. All signatures of the parties to this Agreement may be transmitted
by facsimile or PDF attached to an e-mail, and such facsimile or PDF attached
to an e-mail will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of
such party whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party.
If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be prohibited or
unenforceable by reason of any applicable law of a jurisdiction, then such
provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in such jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other
jurisdiction. The Parties represent, warrant and covenant that each document,
notice, instruction or request provided by such Party to Escrow Agent shall
comply with applicable laws and regulations. Except as expressly provided in
Section 7 above, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall
be construed to give to any person or entity other than Escrow Agent and the
Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in
respect of the Fund or this Agreement.

fees and expenses will be considered extraordinary services for which related
costs, transaction charges, and additional fees will be billed at the Bank\'s
then standard rate. Disbursements, receipts, investments or tax reporting
exceeding 25 items per year may be treated as extraordinary services thereby
incurring additional charges. The Escrow Agent may impose, charge, pass-
through and modify fees and/or charges for any account established and
services provided by the Escrow Agent, including but not limited to,
transaction, maintenance, balance-deficiency, and service fees, agency or
trade execution fees, and other charges, including those levied by any

review of the transaction documents provided and an internal due diligence

the fees quoted herein if the assumptions underlying the activity in the
account, level of balances, market volatility or conditions or other factors
change from those used to set our fees. Payment of the invoice is due upon

The escrow deposit shall be continuously invested in a JPMorgan Chase Bank
money market deposit account ("MMDA"). MMDA have rates of compensation that
may vary from time to time based upon market conditions. The Annual
Administration Fee would include a supplemental charge up to 25 basis points
on the escrow deposit amount if another investment option were to be chosen.

six (6) pre-authorized withdrawals or telephonic trasnfers from an MMDA per
calendar month or statement cycle or similar period. If the MMDA can be
accessed by checks, drafts, bills of exchange, notes and other financial
instruments ("Items"), then no more than three (3) of these six (6) transfers
may be made by an Item. Escrow Agent is required by U.S. law to reserve the
right to require at least seven (7) days notice prior to a withdrawal from a
money market deposit account.
