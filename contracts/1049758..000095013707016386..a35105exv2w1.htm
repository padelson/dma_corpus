The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES  

  

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of the Company or common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "): 

   

 (a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that are owned by the Company and any Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $13.00, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto (including the associated Rights), except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Share in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest thereon. 

   

 (d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, 

    ##### 

  

 

stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust company to act as the payment agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. 

   

 (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificate Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and the Certificate so surrendered or book-entry shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest thereon. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter 

    ##### 

  

 

there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or for which no disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, or to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered at the direction of the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Law, including with respect to stock transfer Taxes payable by the seller. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, or to such Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered at the direction of the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it 

    ##### 

  

 

may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. 

   

 (b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal rights of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

All outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens. Other than the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not directly or indirectly beneficially own any Equity Interests in any other Person. 

   

 Section 3.2 _Capitalization_. 

   

 (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), (ii) 9,500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "), and (iii) 500,000 shares of series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Junior Preferred Stock_ ").

 (i) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, or effect a Company Change in Recommendation, or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, purchase agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause their Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing non-public information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations (including by way of providing non-public information and by exempting any Person from any applicable Takeover Laws or the Rights Agreement). 

   

 (iii) Upon the date hereof, the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Person conducted theretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal and, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, request, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause, the return or destruction of all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a), if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) the Company has not breached Section 5.2(a), (iii) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (iv) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the Company (x) will not, and will not allow its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) will provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent. 

   

 (c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives: (i) any Acquisition Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any 

    ##### 

  

    

inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours)
notify Parent of the identity of such Person and provide Parent with the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing) of
the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any modification
thereto). Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the date hereof, the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent
orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to Section 5.2(b). The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
confidentiality agreement or other agreement with any Person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing the
foregoing information to Parent. Subject to the proviso set forth below, the
Company agrees that neither it nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of an existing
confidentiality or standstill agreement or Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is or becomes a
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) at any time prior to obtaining
the Stockholder Approval in the case of any Person that is not an Interested
Person or an affiliate or Representative of an Interested Person or (ii)
during the period from the date hereof until the date that is 30 days after
the date hereof in the case of any Interested Person or affiliate
or Representative of any Interested Person, the Company and any Company
Subsidiary may waive, amend or modify any such agreement to permit the other
party to such agreement to convey confidentially an Acquisition Proposal to
the Company (subject to Section 5.2(a)(ii)) and otherwise permit such
party and the Company to undertake the activities permitted by Section
5.2(b); _provided_ ,  _further_ , if any such waiver, amendment or
modification of any such agreement results in such agreement having more
favorable terms than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, then the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically, and without
any further action of the parties, be waived, amended or modified, as the
case may be, so that the applicable terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
are consistent with the more favorable terms of such agreement. The Company
shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent of the
occurrence and material terms of any such waiver, amendment or modification
and provide Parent with a copy of such agreement as so amended or modified. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.2(a)(i) to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, (i) if an Intervening Event has occurred or a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, which did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2, received by the Company constitutes a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to all adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (B) below), and the Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that it is required to do so in order to comply with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law, then the Company Board of Directors may withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation (a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ ") and/or (ii) if a bona fide 

    ##### 

  

    

written Acquisition Proposal, which did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.2, received by the Company constitutes a Superior Proposal (after
giving effect to all adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to
clause (B) below), and the Company Board of Directors concludes in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors,
that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law, the Company
may terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii), and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such
termination the Company (1) pays the Termination Fee, as required by Section
8.2(b), and (2) simultaneously with such termination enters into an
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (the
" _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") and terminates this Agreement in
compliance with Section 8.1(d); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
Board of Directors may not effect a Company Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing respective clauses (i) or
(ii), as applicable, unless (A) the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least five (5) calendar days in advance (the " _Notice
Period_ "), of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify,
in the case of clause (i), the basis for the Intervening Event and, in the
case of a clauses (i) (if applicable) and (ii), the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and (B) prior to effecting a Company Change
in Recommendation (but only if such change is due to the existence of
a Superior Proposal) and/or terminating this Agreement pursuant to clause
(ii) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, during the Notice Period, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (but only if such negotiations are requested by
Parent) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.
In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal after the
start of the Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.2(d) with respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period shall be
deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice, except that the
Notice Period shall be reduced to two (2) business days. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders); provided that any public disclosure other than a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the Company) shall be deemed to be a Company Change in Recommendation unless such other public disclosure contains therein an express statement that the Company Board of Directors (i) rejects the applicable Acquisition Proposal or (ii) reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Merger.

 Section 6.1 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of such Person contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate as if made as of any time prior to the Effective Time, such that the conditions set forth in Article VII would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the representations or warranties of the parties, or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall not be required to provide access to, or to disclose information, where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law; _provided_ that the parties to this Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause all such information to be provided in a manner that does not jeopardize such attorney-client privilege or contravene such Law.

any other order in any suit or proceeding, in each case, pursuant to any
antitrust or competition Law or regulation, and (z) no other matter relating
to any antitrust or competition Law or regulation, would preclude
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII by the Outside Date.

hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action with respect to
the businesses, services, or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries

So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, unless such party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt and 

    ##### 

  

    

existence of an Acquisition Proposal and matters related thereto or a Company
Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , _further_ , each party hereto and their
respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this Section
6.4. 

   

 Section 6.5 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company to the fullest extent permissible under applicable provisions of the DGCL and under the Company Governing Documents in effect on the date hereof and under any indemnification or other similar agreements (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") in effect on the date hereof between the Company and the individuals who serve as directors and officers of the Company (the " _Covered Persons_ ") arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their capacity as officers or directors of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to any matters subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.5(a) pursuant to the procedures set forth, and to the extent provided, in the Company Governing Documents or the Indemnification Agreements as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required by the Company Governing Documents or the DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses to the Surviving Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior to and including the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Governing Documents. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons in existence on the date of this Agreement that survive the Merger shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

   

 (d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 300% amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be 

    ##### 

  

    

obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Base Premium, Parent shall
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Base Premium, _provided_ , 
_further_ , if either the Company or Parent, in each case, in its sole
discretion elects, by giving written notice to the other party at least 10
days prior to the Effective Time, then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance,
effective as of the Effective Time, the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall purchase a directors and officers liability insurance "tail" or
"runoff" insurance program for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time with respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly
committed at or prior to the Effective Time (such coverage shall have an
aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount not
to exceed the annual aggregate coverage limit under the Companys existing
directors and officers liability policy, and in all other respects shall be
comparable to such existing coverage), provided that the premium for such
"tail" or "runoff" coverage shall not exceed an amount equal to the Base
Premium. 

   

 (e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. 

   

 (f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.5, and this Section 6.5 shall not be amended after the Effective Time in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby. 

   

 Section 6.6 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or any provision of the Rights Agreement becomes or is deemed to become applicable to Parent or Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby, in each case, then the Company Board of Directors shall take all action necessary to render such statute or provision inapplicable to the foregoing. 

   

 Section 6.7 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Company or a Company Subsidiary to provide, to each employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary who continues to be employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately following the Effective Time (the " _Affected Employees_ "), (a) an initial base salary or initial regular 

    ##### 

  

    

hourly wage, whichever is applicable, that is not less than the base salary
or regular hourly wage provided to such Affected Employee by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (b) for
at least six (6) months following the Effective Time, employee benefits that
are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent (other than any equity-based
benefits). Parent shall maintain and honor, and shall cause the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, and each Company Subsidiary to maintain and honor, the
Companys current severance policy described in Section 6.8 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule for a period of six (6) months after the
Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Company or a Company Subsidiary to provide,
that periods of employment with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (including, without limitation, any current or former affiliate of
the Company or any predecessor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary)
shall be taken into account for purposes of determining, as applicable, the
eligibility for participation and vesting (but not benefit accruals under
any defined benefit plan) of any Affected Employee under all employee benefit
plans (other than any equity-based plans) maintained by Parent or an
affiliate of Parent for the benefit of the Affected Employees, including,
without limitation, vacation plans or arrangements, 401(k) or
other retirement plans and any severance or welfare plans (but expressly
excluding any equity-based plans) to the same extent taken into account for a
similar purpose by the Company under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Company and any Company Subsidiary to, (i) reduce
any period of limitation on health benefits coverage of Affected Employees
due to pre-existing conditions under the applicable health benefits plan of
Parent or an affiliate of Parent by the number of days of an individuals
"creditable coverage," to the extent required by Section 701 of ERISA, and
(ii) credit each Affected Employee with all deductible payments and co-
payments paid by such employee under the health benefit plans of the Company
or its affiliates prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the
Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached
the out-of-pocket maximum under any health benefit plan of Parent or an
affiliate of Parent for such year. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer
upon any Affected Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Company or any affiliate of Parent or the Company, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Company
or any affiliate of Parent or the Company to discharge or terminate the
services of any Affected Employee. This Section 6.8 is not intended to confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder. Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall be construed to modify,
amend, or establish any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or in any way interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of
the parties hereto or any other Person to modify, amend or terminate any of
its employee benefit plans, programs, agreements or arrangements.

 (b) _Termination Fee_. 

    

 (i) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(1), 8.1(c)(2) or 8.1(c)(3), then the Company shall pay to Parent promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business days after the date of such termination, a fee of $10,900,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "). 

   

 (ii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), prior to or concurrent with, and as a condition to, the effectiveness of such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) For purposes of this Section 8.2(b), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.5, except that the reference to "at least 15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "at least 50%". 

  

 (c) Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent (which account instructions Parent shall provide upon request). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

   

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that without such provisions, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay an amount required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.2, and Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company to pay such amount or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub their reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section 8.2(b) hereof or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
