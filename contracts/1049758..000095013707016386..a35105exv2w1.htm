letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and the Certificate so surrendered or
book-entry shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
