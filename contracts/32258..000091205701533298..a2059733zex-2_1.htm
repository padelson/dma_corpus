Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (i) has determined that the Merger is in the best interests of the Company, (ii) has approved and adopted this Agreement, the Plan of Merger, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) has determined to recommend that the shareholders of the Company adopt and approve this Agreement and the Plan of Merger; and

AGREEMENT 

  

 The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

SECTION 1. THE MERGER

  

 1.1 MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY. 

  

 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.3_), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGER.

 1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME.

    satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions). Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, articles of merger
in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
portions of the VSCA, together with such other documents as may be required by
the relevant provisions of the VSCA (the "Articles of Merger") shall be duly
executed on behalf of the Company and simultaneously with the Closing

for filing. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the
filing of the Articles of Merger with the State Corporation Commission of the
Commonwealth of Virginia or such other date and time as may be mutually agreed
upon by Parent and the Company and set forth in the Articles of Merger (the
"Effective Time"). 

  

 1.4 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. 

  

 Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall have the articles of incorporation and bylaws set forth in or as determined in accordance with the Plan of Merger. 

  

 (b) The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

  

 1.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER. 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the Company: 

    

 (i) subject to _Sections 1.5(b)_ , _1.5(c)_ and _1.5(d)_ , each share of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding, other than Excluded Shares, if any, shall be converted into and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive (A) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio _multiplied by_ 0.81, plus (B) cash in the amount of the Exchange Ratio _multiplied by_ 0.19 _multiplied by_ the Average Parent Trading Price, _plus_ (C) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in _Section 1.5(c) _(collectively, the "Merger Consideration"); provided, however, that in the event that the value of the cash and any consideration other than Parent Common Stock received or deemed to be received from Parent by holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the total value of (1) the Merger Consideration _plus_ (2) any other consideration received or deemed to be received from Parent by holders of Company Common Stock (with the value (the "Tax Value") of each share of Parent Common Stock being equal to the closing sales price of shares of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source) determined as of the end of the most recent trading day prior to the Effective Time), then the sum of (x) the amount of cash payable pursuant to clauses (B) and (C) hereof and (y) the value of any other consideration other than Parent Common Stock received or deemed to be received from Parent by holders of Company Common Stock shall be reduced to an amount equal to nineteen percent (19%) of the Value of the Merger Consideration and the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to clause (A) hereof shall be increased to an amount having a value (which value shall equal the sum of the Tax Values of such whole shares of Parent Common Stock) equal to eighty-one percent (81%) of the Value of the Merger Consideration; 

   

      

 For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

 The term "Exchange Ratio" shall be determined as follows: 

  

 (1)

 if the Average Parent Trading Price is greater than $17.74, the Exchange Ratio shall be the decimal (to the fifth decimal place) computed by dividing 13.35 by the Average Parent Trading Price;  


(2)

 if the Average Parent Trading Price is less than or equal to $17.74 and greater than or equal to $16.15, the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.75211; and  


(3)

 if the Average Parent Trading Price is less than $16.15, the Exchange Ratio shall be the decimal (to the fifth decimal place) computed by dividing 12.15 by the Average Parent Trading Price. 
 

  

 The "Average Parent Trading Price" shall mean the average closing sales price on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source) of shares of Parent Common Stock for the fifteen (15) trading-day period ending on the fifth trading day prior to the Company Shareholders\' Meeting. 

  

 The "Value of the Merger Consideration" shall mean the amount equal to the sum of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(i)(A) _(before taking into account any increase in the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the proviso in _Section 1.5(a)(i)_) multiplied by the Tax Value and (ii) the amount of cash payable pursuant to _Sections 1.5(a)(i)(B)_ and _1.5(a)(i)(C)_ (before taking into account any decrease in the amount of cash payable pursuant to the proviso in _Section 1.5(a)(i) _) and (iii) the value of any other consideration, other than that described in clauses (i) and (ii), received or deemed to be received from Parent by holders of Company Common Stock. 

  

   

 (ii) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; and 

  

 (iii) any and all Excluded Shares shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

    

 (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent the record date for any such event is between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in _Section 1.6)_, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such shareholder is entitled (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) by (B) the closing sales price of one (1) share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in the Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source) on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. 

  

    

  (d) Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to receive a fraction of a cent in the Merger (after aggregating all fractions
of a cent payable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a cent
and upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificates (as defined in
_Section 1.6_), be paid in cash the dollar amount obtained by rounding such
fraction of a cent up or down to the nearest cent, without interest.

  

  

 1.6 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY\'S TRANSFER BOOKS. 

   

 At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock ("Shares") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such Shares shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any Shares (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined in _Section 1.7_) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section 1.7_. 

  

 1.7 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Within one (1) business day after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this _Section 1_, (ii) cash representing the amount of cash payable in respect of the Shares pursuant to this _Section 1_, and (iii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 1.5(c) _(such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, and (B) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be immediately canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.7_,  each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any distribution or dividend the record date for which is after the Effective Time. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock or the payment of any cash portion of the Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, and, in such case, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates the Merger Consideration. 

  

    

  (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with this _Section 1.7 _(at which time such holder
shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar
Legal Requirements, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without
interest).

  

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this _Section 1.7 _shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto. 

  

 (e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 (f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official in compliance with any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement. 

  

  

 1.8 FURTHER ACTION. 

  

 If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action. 

  

 1.9 TAX CONSEQUENCES. 

  

 For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

such enforceability may be subject to the effects of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Legal Requirements affecting creditors\' rights generally or subject
to the effects of general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). Each of Parent and its Significant
Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with all of the provisions
of such Government Contracts and is not in default thereunder, and there has
not occurred any event which (whether with or without notice, lapse of
time, or the happening or occurrence of any other event) would constitute
such a default (except in each case where any such default would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent), and the execution of this Agreement by
Parent and its performance hereunder will not cause, or result in, a breach or
default under any Government Contract in each case. There has not been (i) any
failure by Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge
of Parent, any other party to any such Government Contract to comply with all
material provisions thereof which failure to perform would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, (ii) any default by Parent or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereunder, which default would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or (iii) to the knowledge of Parent (A) any written
cancellation thereof which has not been cured or (B) any outstanding dispute
thereunder which has not been cured. Parent is not a guarantor or otherwise
liable for any liability or obligation (including indebtedness) of any other
Person other than any of its Significant Subsidiaries.

 limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and

Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing.

If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

The Company Shareholders\' Meeting shall be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act; provided, however, that without the prior written consent of Parent, which may be granted or withheld in Parent\'s sole discretion, in the event that the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ has not been satisfied, or waived by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, the Company shall not hold the Company Shareholders\' Meeting prior to the date which is eight (8) business days prior

all actions necessary or advisable to solicit proxies in favor of the Merger

 (c) The Company\'s obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company Shareholders\' Meeting in accordance with _Section 5.2(a)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Company Superior Offer or other Company Acquisition Proposal, or by any withdrawal or modification of the Recommendations. 

  

 (d) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Body is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to file, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental Body.

The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to (a) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and (b) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters.

    authorized Representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting
or conference with government representatives relating to any such Legal
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in
connection with any such Legal Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.3_, neither Parent nor the Company nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to substantially impair the overall benefits expected,
as of the date hereof, to be realized from the consummation of the Merger.

  

 5.4 ASSUMPTION OF STOCK OPTIONS. 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time all rights with respect to Company Common Stock under each Employee Option then outstanding shall be converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Employee Option in accordance with the terms and conditions (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Employee Option Plan under which it was issued and the terms and conditions of the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Employee Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Employee Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Employee Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole share, (iii) the per share exercise price under each such Employee Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under such Employee Option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent, and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any such Employee Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Employee Option shall otherwise remain unchanged, except as otherwise provided in such Employee Option with respect to a "change of control".

 (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery under the Employee Options Plans assumed in accordance with this _Section 5.4_. 

  

 (d) Parent shall not assume the Director Option Plan or any Director Options outstanding thereunder. Each Director Option outstanding under the Director Option Plan shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Director Option Plan, including Section 4.2(c) thereof.

    other employee benefit plans; provided, however, that nothing in this
_Section 5.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or Subsidiary to amend or terminate any
such health, vacation or other employee benefit plan at any time; provided,
further, that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation or Subsidiary terminates
any such health, vacation or other employee benefit plan, only to the extent
Parent maintains comparable health, vacation and other employee benefit plans,
then, subject to any transition or waiting period required by Legal
Requirements or any third-party notwithstanding Parent\'s good faith efforts
to obtain a waiver of any such period from such third-party, the
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in Parent\'s health,
vacation and other employee benefit plans, to substantially the same extent as
employees of Parent in similar positions with the same seniority or years of
service and such seniority and service with the Acquired Corporations shall be
recognized for eligibility and vesting purposes. Nothing in this _Section
5.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create any
obligation on behalf of Parent to create any employee benefit plan that does
not exist as of the date of this Agreement or amend any employee benefit plan
currently maintained by Parent, except as any such amendment is required to
give effect to the seniority and years of service provisions with respect to
eligibility and vesting as set forth in this _Section 5.5_, nor shall this be
construed to create any right in any employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to any
other binding written agreement between an employee and Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, the employment of each Continuing Employee shall
be "at will" employment.

 (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide for the benefit of the insured parties named in such policy and the Indemnified Persons, only with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance on terms with respect to coverage and amount at least as favorable as those of the insurance policy maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement in the form attached to the Company Disclosure Schedule as Schedule 5.6 (provided that the Surviving Corporation will not be required to maintain such policy except to the extent that the aggregate annual cost of maintaining such policy is not in excess of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the current annual cost, in which case the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies up to an annual cost of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the current annual amount).

Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts prior to the Effective Time to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Following delivery of the tax representations letters pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.9_, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause Hogan and Hartson L.L.P. and Venable, Baetjer and Howard, LLP, respectively, to deliver to it a tax opinion satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.

 (b) Each of the Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) is reasonably likely to result in any Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations or on Parent, respectively, (ii) would cause or constitute a breach of any representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or (iii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6_ or in Annex I or Annex II not being able to be satisfied prior to the Termination Date.

 Within ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all Persons who are, to the Company\'s knowledge, affiliates of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to remove such legends promptly when such legends are no longer required by applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 5.15 RIGHTS AGREEMENT; LITIGATION.
