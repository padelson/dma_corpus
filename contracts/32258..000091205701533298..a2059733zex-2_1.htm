SIZE=2><B>"Voting Agreement"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) pursuant to which the Shareholders have agreed to vote all of
their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger and to take certain other actions in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. </FONT></P>
