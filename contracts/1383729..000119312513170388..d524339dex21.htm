THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of April 24, 2013 by and among Fusion-io, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Capri Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), NexGen Storage, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Shareholder Representative
Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as
the exclusive representative of the Effective Time Stockholders (as defined
herein) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Representative_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board of Directors has determined that the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which,
among other things, (i) each outstanding share of Company Capital Stock will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the consideration set
forth herein, and (ii) the Company will become a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, as well as all of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and in furtherance thereof, the Company Board of Directors has
determined that this Agreement is advisable and has approved this Agreement in
accordance with applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), and has approved the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
parties hereto are entering into the Escrow Agreement attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

WHEREAS, upon the consummation of the Merger, Parent will deposit the
Indemnity Escrow Amount into a third party escrow fund to be held as partial
security for the indemnification obligations of the Effective Time
Stockholders under this Agreement and to be released to Parent or the former
holders of Company Capital Stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board of Directors has resolved to unanimously recommend
that the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement in accordance with
Delaware Law and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, the Company Stockholders are entering into
Stockholder Support Agreements in favor of Parent (each, a " _Support
Agreement_ " and collectively the " _Support Agreements_ "). WHEREAS, immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Company will seek to obtain (and deliver to Parent) an irrevocable
written consent, each in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (each, a "
_Stockholder Written Consent_ "), from Company Stockholders who collectively
hold at least (i) two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted-to-Company-Common
Stock basis, and (ii) a sufficient number of shares of Company Capital Stock
sufficient to represent the Minimum Stockholder Approval (the Company
Stockholder approvals described in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to
herein as the " _Required Stockholder Approval_ ").

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and material inducement to the willingness of Parent and
Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the employees of the Company listed
on _Schedule 6.2(f)_ are accepting offer letters from Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) (each, an " _Offer Letter_
" and collectively, the " _Offer Letters_ "), each of which will become
effective only upon the consummation of the Merger.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, the persons listed on  _Schedule 6.2(i)_ have entered into and
delivered to Parent Non-Competition Agreements (the " _Non-Competition
Agreements_ ") to be effective upon the Closing Date.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and, as a material
inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, (i) the person listed on _Schedule 6.2(j)(i)_ (the " _Cash
Holdback Stockholder_ ") is executing a Cash Holdback Agreement pursuant to
which Parent will hold back a portion of the cash consideration payable to
such Cash Holdback Stockholder (the " _Cash Holdback Agreement_ "), and (ii)
the person listed on _Schedule 6.2(j)(ii)_ (the " _Stock Holdback Stockholder_
," and together with the Cash Holdback Stockholder, the " _Holdback
Stockholders_ ") is executing a Stock Holdback Agreement (the " _Stock
Holdback Agreement_ " and, together with the Cash Holdback Agreement, the "
_Holdback Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the equity consideration payable
to the Stock Holdback Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject
to certain restrictions, in each case as set forth in the applicable Holdback
Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof.

WHEREAS, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements to the other in connection with and contemplation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the

 



-2-   Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the surviving corporation of the Merger
is hereinafter sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Corporation_."

1.2 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to become
effective by filing a certificate of merger in customary form (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law as soon
as practicable after the Closing (but in any event on the Closing Date if the
Closing occurs at a time in which such filings are accepted for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or the first business day
thereafter if the Closing occurs at a time in which such filings are not
accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware). The
actual time of acceptance of such filing by the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (or any later time as may be mutually agreed upon in writing
by Parent and the Company and expressly designated as the effective time of
the Merger in the Certificate of Merger) is referred to herein as the "
_Effective Time_."

1.3 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, the Merger shall be consummated at a closing (the " _Closing_
") to occur on the date hereof or as soon as practicable thereafter, subject
to the satisfaction or waiver (if permitted hereunder) of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_, other than the conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing (but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if
permitted hereunder) of all conditions as of the Closing) at the offices of
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, 701 5th Avenue,
Suite 5100, Seattle, Washington, unless another date and/or place is mutually
agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company. The date upon which the
Closing actually occurs hereunder is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_."

1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

the Bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the " _Company Organizational Documents_ "), shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit C_. The certificate
of incorporation as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation.

(b) _Bylaws_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated to be
identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_.
The bylaws as so amended and restated shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in

 



-3-   accordance with the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such bylaws; _provided, however_ , that any references to the
name of Merger Sub in such bylaws shall be amended to refer to "NexGen
Storage, Inc."

(c) _Corporate Records_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Parent the original stock books, stock ledgers, minute
books and corporate seal, if any, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
and other controlled Affiliates (if any).

 

1.6 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_.

(a) _Directors_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

(b) _Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective

and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of Merger Sub capital stock, each share of common stock of Merger Sub
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become, and shall thereupon represent, one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted.

1.9(d)_ of this Agreement;

(D) with respect to each outstanding Stock Holdback Common Share, the

Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock that is cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(i)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder

respect of each such certificate shall be rounded down to the nearest cent.

 



-5-  (iii) _Company Treasury Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each
share of Company Capital Stock that is outstanding and held of record by the
Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Treasury
Stock_ ") shall continue to be so held and no consideration shall be paid or
payable in respect thereof.

(iv) _Parent Owned Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each share of Company Capital Stock that is outstanding and held of
record by Parent or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (" _Parent Owned Company Capital Stock_ ") shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall thereupon cease to exist.

(v) _Dissenting Shares_.

(A) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
eligible under Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") to exercise
appraisal rights and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand, and properly
demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to Section 262, and complies in
all respects with the provisions of Section 262 and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to demand relief as a dissenting stockholder under
the DGCL as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(i)_, and the holder or holders of
such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such
holder or holders in Section 262\. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
_Section 1.7(b)(v)_, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to
appraisal under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such
event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration payable or otherwise deliverable in respect of such shares
pursuant to  _Section 1.7(b)(i)_, without interest, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares. Any (i) payment or payments in respect
of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the portion of the Merger Consideration
that otherwise would have been payable or deliverable at the time of Closing
in respect of such shares in accordance with _Section 1.7(b)(i) _or (ii)
Damages (including attorneys and consultants fees, costs and expenses and
including any such fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any action or proceeding) in
respect of any Dissenting Shares are, collectively are referred to herein as "
_Dissenting Share Payments_."

(B) The Company shall (1) comply with the requirements of Section 262, (2)
give Parent prompt notice of any written demand received by the Company
pursuant to Section 262 of withdrawals of such demands, and provide copies of
any documents or instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company and (3) give Parent the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement, or offer to pay or settle, prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing
to such payment or settlement offer.

 



-6-  (c) _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(i) _Unvested Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding
Unvested Company Option held by a Continuing Employee, regardless of the
respective exercise prices thereof, will be assumed by Parent. Each Unvested
Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in
the applicable Unvested Company Option (including any applicable stock option
agreement or other document evidencing such Unvested Company Option)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or
vesting provisions as such provisions have been amended pursuant to this
_Section 1.7(c)_), except that: (A) each assumed Unvested Company Option will
be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise
of such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (B) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Unvested
Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by  _dividing_ the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Unvested
Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; _provided, however_ ,
that Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to each Unvested Company Option assumed by
Parent;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , in the case of any Company
Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 of the Code, the per share exercise price of the option,
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the
terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order
to comply with Section 424 of the Code and satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1, and each Company
Option will be adjusted in a manner so as not to cause such Company Option to
constitute a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code
solely as a result of such assumption and conversion and otherwise is
accordance with the exemption for stock options under Section 409A of the
Code.

(ii) _Vested Company Options_. Parent shall not assume any Vested Company
Options, or substitute any Vested Company Options with an equivalent option or
right, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Vested Company
Option shall be cancelled, and, subject to first providing all documentation
reasonably required by Parent, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Vested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to (1) the Per Share Participation Amount, 
_minus_ (2) the per share exercise price of such Vested Company Option (such
amounts with respect to each Vested Company Option, the " _Option Merger
Consideration_ "). Each Vested Company Option that is not exercised as of the
Effective Time and has an exercise price greater than the Per Share
Participation Amount shall be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time,
without payment in respect thereof. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, subject to  _Section 1.9(d)_ and to each holder of Vested
Company Options first providing all documentation reasonably required by
Parent, pay or cause to be paid (1) through the payroll service of the
Surviving Corporation, the applicable Option Merger Consideration to holders
of Vested Company Options (other than Non-Employee Options), and

 



-7-   (2) through the Payment Agent, the applicable Option Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Non-Employee Options. If requested by Parent, as a
condition to being paid the Option Merger Consideration, each holder of
Vested Company Options shall execute a letter of transmittal in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(iii) _Termination of Certain Options_. Parent shall not assume any Company
Options held by any individual who at the Effective Time is not a Continuing
Employee (each, a " _Non-Continuing Employee_ "). Each Company Option held by
a Non-Continuing Employee shall be cancelled and terminated at the Effective
Time. Each Vested Company Option held by a Non-Continuing Employee outstanding
at the time of the Closing shall be treated in the manner set forth in
_Section 1.7(c)(ii)_; _provided_ , that any payment pursuant to _Section
1.7(c)(ii)_ to a Non-Continuing Employee Parent Common Stock to any such
Person, shall be subject to the receipt by Parent or the Payment Agent of a
Form W-9 or W-8BEN or any successor form (as applicable) duly completed and
executed by the Non-Continuing Employee. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all action that may be necessary (under the Company Stock
Plan and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this _Section
1.7(c)(iii)_ and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Non-
Continuing Employees who hold Unvested Company Options have no rights with
respect thereto other than those specifically provided in this _Section
1.7(c)(iii)_.

(iv) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company RSU
held by a Continuing Employee will be assumed by Parent. Each Company RSU so
assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company RSU
(including any applicable restricted stock unit agreement or other document
evidencing a Company RSU) immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
any vesting provisions), except that each assumed Company RSU will cover that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

(v) _Necessary Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all reasonable actions necessary to effect the treatment of Company Options,
Company RSUs and Company Warrants provided for under this _Section 1.7(c)_
and _Section 1.7(d)_, including under the Company Stock Plan, all Contracts
governing the terms of all Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Warrants
and under any other plan, Contract or arrangement to which the Company is a
party or by which the Company may be bound, including by giving any
required notice and obtaining any required consent contemplated thereby.
Prior to the Closing Date, on a date reasonably determined by Parent, subject
to the reasonable approval of the Company, the Company shall send a notice to
all holders of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Warrants with
respect to the treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Warrants
provided for in this _Section 1.7(c)_ and _Section 1.7(d)_, which notice
shall contain such information as reasonably agreed to by Parent and the
Company. The Company shall not send any notices to any holders of Company
Options, Company RSUs or Company Warrants or solicit any consents or other
approvals from the holders of any Company Options, Company RSUs or Company
Warrants unless and until Parent has reviewed and approved all notices and
related documentation (including any email messages and notifications) to be
sent to such holders of Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Warrants in
connection therewith.

 



-8-  (vi) _Form S-8_. Within twenty (20) business days following the
Closing, Parent shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a
registration statement on Form S-8 that will register the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the Unvested Company Options and Company RSUs that are
assumed by Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.7(c)_ to the extent eligible
for registration on Form S-8 and, so long as Form S-8 is available with
respect thereto, maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for
so long as any Unvested Company Options and Company RSUs remain outstanding,
subject to any company-wide suspensions by Parent of its registration
statements.

(d) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding warrant
to purchase shares of Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Company Warrant_ ")
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the following
(without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholding): (i) with respect
to each share of Company Common Stock issuable immediately prior to the
Effective Time upon the exercise of such Company Warrant, an amount equal to:
(A) the Per Share Participation Amount _minus_ (B) the per share exercise
price of such Company Warrant with respect to Company Common Stock; and (ii)
with respect to each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock issuable
immediately prior to the Effective Time upon the exercise of such Company
Warrant, an amount equal to: (A) (1) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that would be issuable upon the conversion of such share of Company
Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Charter, if such share of Company
Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, _multiplied by_ (2) the Per Share Participation Amount _plus_ (B) the
Series A Per Share Preference and _minus_ (C) the per share exercise price of
such Company Warrant with respect to Company Series A Preferred Stock; (each
of clause (i) and (ii), the " _Warrant Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all such Company Warrants shall be cancelled and shall
represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Warrant
Merger Consideration; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each Company Warrant
that is not exercised as of the Effective Time, and with respect to which the
Warrant Merger Consideration, as calculated in accordance with this _Section
1.7(d)_, is equal to or less than zero, shall be cancelled and terminated at
the Effective Time without payment in respect thereof. If requested by Parent,
as a condition to being paid the Warrant Merger Consideration, each holder of
a Company Warrant shall execute a letter of transmittal in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent.

1.8 _Closing Financial Statement_. At the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent an unaudited balance sheet of the Company, as of the
Closing, which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except that the
Closing Date Balance Sheet will not be required to include footnotes) using
the same accounting methods, standards, policies, practices and estimation
methodologies used to prepare the Financial Statements (the " _Closing Date
Balance Sheet_ "), and, based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, a statement,
in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, setting forth the Companys
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, the Closing Net Working
Capital Deficit (if any), the Company Debt, the Transaction Expenses, the
Aggregate Vested Exercise Price and, based on such amounts, the Aggregate
Merger Consideration (the " _Closing Financial Statement_ "), which shall be
certified in writing as complete and accurate by the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The Closing Financial
Statement shall be based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and shall fairly
and accurately present the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, the Closing Net
Working Capital Deficit (if any), the Company Debt, the Transaction Expenses
and the Aggregate Vested Exercise Price. The Company shall prepare in good
faith and deliver to Parent an estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and an
estimated Closing Financial Statement at least three (3) business days prior
to the Closing Date. 

 



-9-  1.9 _Payment Procedures; Escrow Deposit_.

 

(a) _Payment Fund_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay (i) the Closing Payments to
each Effective Time Stockholder, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Option
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Non-Employee Options, and (iii) the
Warrant Merger Consideration to the holder of Company Warrants. The cash
amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_." The funds included in the Payment Fund shall remain uninvested. Any
interest or other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be
the property of, and will be paid to, Parent.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Within one (1) day after the Closing Date, Parent
shall direct the Payment Agent to mail to each Effective Time Stockholder a
letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
E_ (a " _Stockholder Transmittal Letter_ "), which shall (i) specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a certificate(s)
representing shares of the Company Capital Stock that are being converted into
the right to receive payment pursuant to  _Section 1.7(b)(i)_ (each, a "
_Company Stock Certificate_ ") shall pass only upon delivery of such
certificate(s) to the Payment Agent after the Effective Time, (ii) be in such
form and have such other reasonable provisions not inconsistent with this
Agreement as Parent or the Payment Agent may specify, (iii) include IRS Form
W-9 or Form W-8BEN or any successor form, as applicable, and (iv) include
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock
Certificate(s) for that portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the shares of Company Capital Stock represented thereby under this
Agreement. The payment of the appropriate Closing Payment to any holder of
Company Capital Stock is expressly conditioned upon the execution and delivery
of a Stockholder Transmittal Letter, properly completed and duly executed by
each such Effective Time Stockholder. After the Effective Time, and after the
Payment Agent receives a Company Stock Certificate, together with a properly
completed and duly executed Stockholder Transmittal Letter, Parent shall
instruct the Payment Agent to promptly pay to such Effective Time Stockholder
that portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such Effective Time
Stockholder at the Effective Time of the Merger in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented by such Company Stock Certificate(s) (such amount, which for
avoidance of doubt does not include the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Expense
Escrow Amount or the Cash Holdback Amount, the " _Closing Payment_ "), and the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If
payment of any portion of the applicable Closing Payment is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate(s) are
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person requesting
such payment (A) shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by
reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered, and shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Payment Agent that such Tax
has been paid, or (B) shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and
the Payment Agent that such Tax is not applicable. From and after the
Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.9(b)_,
each Company Stock Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Capital
Stock shall be deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration, if any, in respect of such shares of
Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and in the manner provided herein.

(c) _Escrow Deposit_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Indemnity Escrow
Amount and the Expense Escrow Amount shall be withheld from the Merger
Consideration in accordance with  _Section 1.7(b)(i)_ and shall not be
distributed to the Effective Time Stockholders except in accordance with
_Section 7.2(d)(iv)_ of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and Parent
shall deposit 

 



-10-   into escrow with the Escrow Agent the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the
Expense Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Indemnity Escrow Fund
as partial security for the indemnification obligations of the Effective Time
Stockholders under this Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement, and the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall be subject to reduction for Indemnification Claims as
provided in _Article VII_. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Expense Escrow
Fund for purposes of reimbursing the costs and expenses incurred by the
Representative in the performance of its duties hereunder in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Parent nor any Affiliate of
Parent shall have any rights (including informational rights), control over,
or entitlement to the Expense Escrow Fund. Fifty percent (50%) of the fees
and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be deemed Transaction Expenses. Each
Effective Time Stockholders rights, if any, to receive amounts from the
Escrow Funds are non-transferable and non-assignable, except by will, trust
or intestacy. No interest shall accrue on amounts held in the Escrow Funds,
except as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

(d) _Holdback Amounts_.

(i) At the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_ to the Cash
Holdback Stockholder in respect of his shares of Company Capital Stock an
amount in cash equal to the Cash Holdback Amount, as more fully set forth
in the Cash Holdback Agreement. The Cash Holdback Amount shall be held by
Parent and administered following the Closing in accordance with the terms of
the Cash Holdback Agreement and the payment and/or forfeiture of the Cash
Holdback Amount with respect to the Cash Holdback Stockholder will be subject
to the terms and conditions of the Cash Holdback Agreement. The amount
constituting the Cash Holdback Amount shall consist of the portion of the
Merger Consideration payable to the Cash Holdback Stockholder that is not
being contributed to the Escrow Funds.

(ii) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall issue the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the Stock Holdback Stockholder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_ in respect of the Stock Holdback Common
Shares. Such shares shall be issued in the name of the Stock Holdback
Stockholder but shall be retained by Parent and shall be subject to the terms
and restrictions of the Stock Holdback Agreement, including with respect to
their release and/or forfeiture. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
will be issued by virtue of the Merger. For purposes of calculating the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Stock Holdback
Stockholder, all shares issuable to the Stock Holdback Stockholder pursuant to
_Section 1.7(b)_ (without rounding) shall be aggregated and after such
aggregation, such amount shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and
the Stock Holdback Stockholder shall, if he would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, receive from Parent an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product
of: (A) such fraction, _multiplied by_ (B) the Trading Price. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no portion of the Merger Consideration shall be paid or
delivered to the Stock Holdback Stockholder with respect to any Stock Holdback
Common Share prior to receipt by Parent of written confirmation from the
Payment Agent that the Payment Agent has received from the Stock Holdback
Stockholder (i) the Company Stock Certificate(s) representing the Stock
Holdback Common Shares and (ii) a Stockholder Transmittal Letter properly
completed and duly executed by the Stock Holdback Stockholder.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Payment Agent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold and pay
over to the applicable Taxing

 



-11-   Authorities from the payment of any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable to any Person under this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld and paid over with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other applicable Laws and to request and be
provided the applicable Form W-9 or W-8 or any successor form from each such
Person. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid by the Company,
Parent, the Payment Agent or the Surviving Corporation to the applicable
Taxing Authorities on behalf of the holders of Company Capital Stock, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person _to whom such_ amounts would otherwise have
been paid. Without limiting the terms of _Section 7.2_ to the extent that the
consideration is not reduced by such deductions or withholdings, such Person
shall indemnify Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company and the
Surviving Corporation) and agents for any amounts imposed by any Taxing
Authorities, together with any related Damages, other than Damages
attributable to Parents willful misconduct or gross negligence.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate(s)
which formerly represented shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of (a) an affidavit of
that fact by the Effective Time Stockholder in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Payment Agent (a " _Lost Stock Affidavit_ "), the Payment
Agent shall pay such Effective Time Stockholder the portion of the Merger
Consideration to which such Effective Time Stockholder is entitled pursuant
to  _Section 1.7(b)(i)_; _provided, however_ , that either Parent or the
Payment Agent may, in its sole discretion (acting in good faith), require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s) or agreements to
deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Payment Agent and post a bond in such sum as the Payment Agent
may require, against any claim that may be made against the Payment Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificate(s) or
agreements alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed (the " _Lost
Certificate Indemnity Agreement_ ").

(g) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to Effective Time Stockholders as of the date that is
180 days after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
the Effective Time Stockholders who have not theretofore surrendered their
Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this _Section 1.9_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the
portion of the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of
Company Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificates, without any interest thereon.

 

(h) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any Company
Stockholder, holder of Company Options, holder of Company Warrants or any
other Person for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar applicable Law. Any portion of
the Merger Consideration or other amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
Company Securities three (3) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any Lien.

1.10 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares
of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of
the shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with

 



-12-   respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Laws. After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cancel and exchange, as provided in this  _Section 1.10_, any presented
certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

1.11 _Taking of Further Necessary Action_. Each of Parent, the Company and the
Representative will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger and cause the
distribution of proceeds in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as
possible. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
the officers and directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time are and will remain fully authorized in the name of the Company or
otherwise to take, and shall take, upon request by Parent, all such lawful and
necessary action.

Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i) the filing of the Certificate

(a) the amounts required to pay off in full on the Closing Date, the
Indebtedness owing to such creditor (including the outstanding principal,

transfer information for such payment; (b) upon payment of

 



-60-   such amounts, a release of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (c) the

_TriNet_ ") of such Participation Termination and will take all corporate
action reasonably necessary to effect such Participation Termination with

employee benefit plan terminated pursuant to a Participation Termination are
reasonably anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges, or
other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of
such terminated plan or upon the Company or plan sponsor, then the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of
such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent at
least three (3) business days prior to the Effective Time and such amount
shall not be taken into account for purposes of calculating the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount.

5.16  _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto, at the request of another
party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other certificates, instruments,
agreements and other documents, and do and perform such other acts and things,

(B) a breach of this Agreement, in each case, other than equitable remedies
and the Parent Indemnified Parties hereby waive and release any and all tort
claims and causes of action that may relate to, arise out of, or are in
connection with this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, in each case other than any claim relating to, arising out of
or in connection with fraud, willful and knowing breach or intentional
breach). To the extent a Parent Indemnified Party has recovered Damages with
respect to a matter under a provision of _Section 7.2_, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall not be permitted to recover under a different
provision of _Section 7.2_ for the same Damages already recovered (it being
understood that a partial recovery for Damages under one provision of
_Section 7.2_ shall not limit the Parent Indemnified Parties ability to
recover additional Damages under such provision or any other provision of
_Section 7.2_).

 

(c) _Indemnification Claims_.

(i) If a Parent Indemnified Party is of the opinion that it has or may acquire
a right to indemnification under this _Article VII_ (each, an "
_Indemnification Claim_ "), such Parent Indemnified Party may so notify the
Representative (and in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from an Effective Time Stockholder, such Effective Time
Stockholder) in a written notice, signed by such Parent Indemnified Party, or
any officer thereof (each, an " _Officer s Certificate_"): (A) stating that
such Parent Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly paid, sustained or
incurred any Damages, or reasonably anticipates that it will directly or
indirectly pay, sustain or incur any Damages; (B) specifying in reasonable
detail the individual items of Damages included in the amount so stated (and
the method of computation of each such item of Damages, if applicable), the
date each such item of Damages was paid, sustained or incurred, or the basis
for such reasonably anticipated Damages; (C) providing a brief description in
reasonable detail (to the extent available to such Parent Indemnified Party)
of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to each item of Damages
based on such Parent Indemnified Partys good faith belief thereof; and (D)
stating the basis for indemnification under _Section 7.2_ to which such item
of Damages is related.

(ii) If the Representative (or in the event that indemnification is being
sought hereunder directly from an Effective Time Stockholder, such Effective
Time Stockholder) shall not object in writing pursuant to _Section
7.2(c)(iii)_ to any individual items of Damages set forth in an Officers
Certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ within
thirty (30) calendar days after the Representatives (or such Effective Time
Stockholders, as applicable) receipt of such Officers Certificate, then: (A)
the Representative (or such Effective Time Stockholder, as applicable) shall
be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged and irrevocably consented, for and
on behalf of the Effective Time Stockholders (with respect to the
Representative) or itself (with respect to a claim brought against an
Effective Time Stockholder), (1) to the Parent Indemnified Party recovery of
the full amount of all such items of Damages set forth in such Officers
Certificate, and (2) if and to the extent necessary, and without further
notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for damages
against the Effective Time Stockholders (with respect to a claim administered
by the Representative) or against the Effective Time Stockholder in question
(with respect to a claim brought against such Effective Time

 



-70-   Stockholder) for such items of Damages in any court having competent
jurisdiction over the matter; (B) with respect to an Indemnification Claim
delivered to the Representative, within three (3) business days thereafter,
Parent and the Representative shall execute and deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
full amount of such items of indemnifiable Damages set forth in such
Officers Certificate to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund (to the extent of the Indemnity Escrow Fund) and (C)
with respect to an Indemnification Claim brought against an Effective
Time Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder shall pay to the Parent
Indemnified Party, within ten (10) business days thereafter, the full amount
of such items of indemnifiable Damages set forth in such Officers
Certificate.

 

(iii) In the event that Parent shall receive written authorization from the
Representative to reduce the amounts held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, then
within three (3) business days thereafter, Parent and the Representative shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release the amount of Damages set forth in such written
instructions to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund (to the extent of the Indemnity Escrow Fund).

(iv) In the event that the Representative (or, in the event that
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Effective Time
Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder) shall seek to contest any
individual items of Damages set forth in an Officers Certificate received
from Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)(i)_, the Representative (or such
Effective Time Stockholder, as applicable) shall notify Parent in
writing, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such Officers
Certificate, of the Representatives objection (or such Effective Time
Stockholders objection, as applicable), which notice shall set forth a brief
description in reasonable detail of the Representatives basis (or such
Effective Time Stockholders basis, as applicable) for objecting to each item
of Damages based on the Representatives good faith belief thereof (or such
Effective Time Stockholders good faith belief thereof, as applicable). Upon
Parents receipt of a written notice of objection from the Representative (or
such Effective Time Stockholder, as applicable) pursuant to the preceding
sentence, Parent and the Representative (or such Effective Time Stockholder,
as applicable) shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to the disputed items of Damages. If the
Representative (or such Effective Time Stockholder, as applicable) and Parent
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth the agreement reached by the
parties with respect to such disputed items of Damages shall be prepared and
signed by both parties, and (A) with respect to an agreement by the
Representative, within three (3) business days thereafter, Parent and the
Representative shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the full amount of
such items of Damages set forth in such memorandum to the applicable Parent
Indemnified Party from the Indemnity Escrow Fund (to the extent of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund) and (B) with respect to an agreement by an Effective
Time Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder shall pay to the applicable
Parent Indemnified Party, within ten (10) business days thereafter, the full
amount of such items of Damages set forth in such memorandum. Following the
delivery of an Officers Certificate, the Representative (or such Effective
Time Stockholder, as applicable) and its representatives and agents shall be
given reasonable access during Parents normal business hours as they may
reasonably require to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation for
the purposes of investigating or resolving any disputes or responding to any
matters or inquiries raised in the Officers Certificate, subject, in the case
of an Effective Time Stockholder, to the execution of a non-disclosure
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent or, in the case of the
Stockholder Representative, to the provisions of _Section 5.8(b)_.

 



-71-  (v) If within sixty (60) days after the Representatives receipt (or
such Effective Time Stockholders receipt, as applicable) of such Officers
Certificate, and after good faith negotiations, the parties are unable to
agree on the rights of the respective parties with respect to any disputed
items of Damages set forth in an Officers Certificate, either Parent or the
Representative (or such Effective Time Stockholder, as applicable) may elect
for such claim or dispute to be finally settled by binding arbitration in Salt
Lake City, Utah in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association and judgment upon the award
rendered may be entered in any court having personal jurisdiction over the
judgment debtor. Such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator
chosen by mutual agreement of Parent and the Representative (or such Effective
Time Stockholder, as applicable). Alternatively, at the request of either
Parent or the Representative (or such Effective Time Stockholder, as
applicable) before the commencement of arbitration, the arbitration shall be
conducted by three independent arbitrators, none of whom shall have any
competitive interests with Parent, the Representative or the Effective
Time Stockholders. Parent and the Representative (or such Effective Time
Stockholder, as applicable) shall each select one arbitrator. The two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator none of whom shall
have any prior relationship with the Parent Indemnified Party or the
Effective Time Stockholders. The arbitrator or majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or
majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant
information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute.
The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the
authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, including attorneys fees
and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should
the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The
decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon (x) in the case of an
Indemnification Claim administered by the Representative, the parties and
signatories to this Agreement (including all of the Parent Indemnified Parties
and the Effective Time Stockholders), or (y) in the case of an Indemnification
Claim brought against an Effective Time Stockholder, Parent and such
Effective Time Stockholder, and Parent shall be entitled to act in accordance
with such decision, and, if applicable (A) with respect to an Indemnification
Claim administered by the Representative, within three (3) business days
thereafter, Parent shall be authorized to deliver written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the full amount to which
the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to such decision to such
Parent Indemnified Party from the Indemnity Escrow Fund (to the extent of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund), and the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to follow
such instructions without any further action from the Representative and (B)
in the case of an Indemnification Claim brought against an Effective Time
Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder shall pay to the Parent
Indemnified Party, within ten (10) business days thereafter, the amount of
such the full amount to which the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled
pursuant to such decision. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), including
attorneys and experts fees and costs awarded to the prevailing party. Until
the termination of the arbitration proceedings, the fees and costs of the
arbitrator(s) shall be borne as follows: 50% shall be borne by Parent and
50% shall be borne proportionately by the Effective Time Stockholders (which
will be paid from the Expense Escrow Fund by the Representative, to the extent
there are amounts in the Expense Escrow Fund) and following the termination of
the arbitration proceedings the fees and costs of the arbitrator(s) shall be
allocated and paid as directed by the arbitrator(s).

 



-72-  (d) _Payment of Indemnification Claims from Indemnity Escrow Fund;
Distribution of the Indemnity Escrow Fund_.

(i) So long as the amount in the Indemnity Escrow Fund exceeds the aggregate
amount of all Indemnification Claims that have been asserted but not
resolved, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall seek to recover amounts in
respect of Indemnification Claims under this Agreement from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund prior to seeking to recover amounts in respect of such
Indemnification Claims directly from any Effective Time Stockholder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any amounts are released from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund to any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant
to Indemnification Claims brought pursuant to clauses "(ii)""(xi)" of
_Section 7.2(a)_, inclusive, such recovered amounts shall not reduce the
amount that the Parent Indemnified Parties may recover pursuant to clauses
"(i)" or "(xii)" of _Section 7.2(a)_.

(ii) Promptly after the Survival Date, Parent will notify the Representative
in writing of the amount that Parent determines in good faith to be necessary
to satisfy all Indemnification Claims that have been asserted in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, but not resolved on or prior to 11:59 p.m.
(Pacific time) on the Survival Date (each such claim a " _Continuing Claim_ "
and such amount, the " _Retained Indemnity Escrow Amount_ "). Subject to
_Section 7.2(d)(iv)_, within ten (10) business days following the Survival
Date, Parent and the Representative shall execute and deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Payment Agent for distribution to the
Effective Time Stockholders, an amount equal to (A) the amount held in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund as of the Survival Date (as reduced from time to time
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) _minus_ (B) the Retained Indemnity
Escrow Amount, with each Effective Time Stockholder to receive a portion
thereof equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the amount to be so
released _by_ (2) such Effective Time Stockholders Pro Rata Portion.

(iii) Following the Survival Date, after resolution and payment of a
Continuing Claim, Parent and the Representative shall, subject to _Section
7.2(d)(iv)_, promptly execute and deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund to the Payment Agent for distribution to the Effective Time
Stockholders, an amount equal to (A) the amount held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund as of the date of such resolution and payment _minus_ (B) the amounts
that Parent determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy other
Continuing Claims, with each Effective Time Stockholder to receive a portion
thereof equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the amount to be so
released _by_ (2) such Effective Time Stockholders Pro Rata Portion.

(iv) With respect to any amount to be released from the Escrow Funds to the
Effective Time Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 7.2(d)(iv)_ or the
Escrow Agreement: (A) if any Company Stockholder has not executed and
delivered a properly completed Stockholder Transmittal Letter and surrendered
such Effective Time Stockholders Company Stock Certificate in accordance
with _Section 1.9(b)_ (the " _Payment Conditions_ ") prior to the delivery to
the Escrow Agent of the applicable (if any) joint written instructions, then
any amount that would otherwise be released to such Company Stockholder shall
be held by the Payment Agent, without interest, until such Company Stockholder
satisfies the applicable Payment Conditions; (B) any amount that would
otherwise be released to an Effective Time Stockholder shall be subject to
_Section 1.9(d)_; and (C) each distribution to be made from the Escrow Funds
to a particular Company Stockholder shall be effected in accordance with the
payment delivery instructions set forth in such Company Stockholders
Stockholder Transmittal Letter (unless the Representative or the Company
Stockholder provides Parent with written updated payment delivery

 



-73-   instructions no later than the date that is two (2) business days after the
Survival Date), and all written instructions to be delivered to the Escrow
Agent with respect to any distribution from the Escrow Funds shall be
consistent with this _Section 7.2(d)(iv)_.

(e) _Effective Time Stockholders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, the Charter or Bylaws of the Company, or in any agreement between
the Company and any Effective Time Stockholder to the contrary entered into
prior to the Closing, in no event shall the Surviving Corporation, as the
successor in interest to the Company by virtue of the Merger, or Parent, be
obligated to reimburse, contribute, indemnify or hold harmless any Effective
Time Stockholder in its capacity as a former holder of Company Securities for
or in connection with any Damages or obligations of the Company under this
_Article VII_.

(f) _Third Party Actions_. In the event any Action is instituted against a
Parent Indemnified Party which involves or appears reasonably likely to
involve an Indemnification Claim hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), Parent
will, promptly after receipt of notice of any such Action, notify the
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Effective Time Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder)
of the commencement thereof. The failure to so notify the Representative (or,
in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Effective Time Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder) of the
commencement of any such Action will relieve the Effective Time
Stockholders from liability in connection therewith only if and to the extent
that such failure materially and adversely affects the defense of such Action.
Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to control the defense
and settlement of such Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Effective Time Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder)
and its counsel (at the sole expense of the Effective Time Stockholders) may
participate in (but not control the conduct of) the defense of such Action;
_provided further_ that, except with the consent of the Representative (or, in
the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Effective Time Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder) (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), no settlement of
any such Action with third party claimants shall be determinative of
the amount of Damages relating to such matter. In the event that the
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Effective Time Stockholder, such Effective Time Stockholder)
has consented to any such settlement, the Effective Time Stockholders shall
have no power or authority to object under any provision of this _Article
VII_ to the amount of any such Indemnification Claim against the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, or against the Effective Time Stockholders directly, as the case
may be, with respect to such settlement.

(g) _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Effective Time Stockholders,
the Representative and Parent agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to
treat) any payments received pursuant to _Section 7.2_ as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Laws.

(h) _Effect of Investigation; Reliance_. The right to indemnification,
payment of Damages or any other remedy hereunder will not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company or any other matter. The waiver of
any condition based on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty,
or on the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreement,
will not affect the right to

 



-74-   indemnification, payment of Damages, or any other remedy based on any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Parent Indemnified Party
shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement set forth in this Agreement or the Related
Agreements in order for such Parent Indemnified Party to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder except in the case of a claim for fraud. Parent
and the Company each acknowledge that such Damages, if any, would relate to
unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at
the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the Aggregate Merger
Consideration that Parent would have paid in connection with the Merger.

7.3 _Representative_. As a result of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereunder by the Company Stockholders, the Effective
Time Stockholders hereby appoint the Representative as their true and lawful
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact, to execute and deliver this Agreement and
exercise all or any of the powers, authority and discretion conferred on him
or her under this Agreement.

(a) _Powers of the Representative_.

(i) The Representative shall have and may exercise all of the powers conferred
upon him or her pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, which
shall include:

(A) After the Closing, the power and authority to negotiate and resolve with
the Parent Indemnified Parties the determination of the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, the Closing Net Working Capital Deficit (if any), the
Transaction Expenses, the Subject Restricted Cash, the Company Debt and the
Aggregate Merger Consideration;

(B) The power to execute any agreement or instrument in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for and on behalf of the Effective Time
Stockholders;

(C) The power to give or receive any notice or instruction permitted or
required under this Agreement, or any other agreement, document or instrument
entered into or executed in connection herewith, to be given or received by
any Effective Time Stockholder, and each of them (other than notice for
service of process relating to any Action before a court or other tribunal of
competent jurisdiction that is not limited to claims against the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, which notice must be given to each Effective Time Stockholder
individually, as applicable), and to take any and all action for and on
behalf of Effective Time Stockholders, and each of them, under this Agreement
or any other such agreement, document or instrument;

(D) The power to authorize payment to any Parent Indemnified Party of any of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, in satisfaction of any Indemnification Claims,
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such Indemnification Claims, resolve any Indemnification Claims,
take any actions in connection with the resolution of any dispute relating
hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby by arbitration, settlement
or otherwise, and take or forego any or all actions permitted or required of
any Effective Time Stockholder or necessary in the judgment of the
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other
terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement;

 



-75-  (E) The power to consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Effective Time Stockholders;

(F) The power to review, negotiate and agree to and authorize any payments
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or otherwise in satisfaction of any payment
obligation, in each case, on behalf of the Effective Time Stockholders, as
contemplated thereunder;

 

(G) The power to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement providing
rights or benefits to the Effective Time Stockholders (other than the payment
of the portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable or otherwise
deliverable as of the Closing Date in accordance with the terms hereof and in
the manner provided herein); and

 

(H) The power to take any actions in regard to such other matters as are
reasonably necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or as the Representative reasonably believes are in the best interests
of the Effective Time Stockholders;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary set forth herein, the powers conferred above shall not authorize
or empower the Representative to settle any Indemnification Claim to the
extent such settlement provides for the direct recovery of Damages by a Parent
Indemnified Party from any Effective Time Stockholder (i.e., beyond the
Indemnity Escrow Amount).

(b) _Representations of Representative_. The Representative hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

(i) The Representative has all necessary limited liability company power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out his, her or
its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Representative and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of the Representative, enforceable against the
Representative in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general application affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general equity principles and
the laws of agency.

(c) _Representative Procedures upon Receipt of Indemnification Claims_. The
Representative shall have the discretion to take such action as it shall
determine to be in the best interest of all of the Effective Time
Stockholders, including authorizing the distribution to any Parent Indemnified
Party of any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in any event, all Effective Time Stockholders are treated in
substantially the same manner.

(d) _Notices_. Any notice given to the Representative following the Closing
will constitute notice to each and all of the Effective Time Stockholders at
the time notice is given to the Representative. Any action taken by, or
notice or instruction received from, the Representative will be deemed to be
action by, or notice or instruction from, each and all of the Effective Time
Stockholders. Except as otherwise set forth herein, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation may, and Parent will, disregard any
notice or instruction received from any one or more individual Effective Time
Stockholders.

 



-76-  (e) _Agreement of the Representative_. The Representative hereby agrees to do
such acts, and execute further documents, as shall be necessary to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement.

(f) _Limitation on Liability_. The Representative shall not be liable to any
Effective Time Stockholder for any act done or omitted hereunder or under the
Escrow Agreement as Representative while acting in good faith and without
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Effective Time Stockholders shall
severally based on their respective Pro Rata Portions (but not jointly)
indemnify and defend the Representative and hold the Representative harmless
against any Damages (each, a " _Representative Loss_ ") relating to, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Representatives duties hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, in each case
as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ that in the
event it is finally determined by a court of law that such Representative Loss
or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Representative, the Representative will reimburse the
Effective Time Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid
directly to the Representative by the Effective Time Stockholders, any such
Representative Loss may be recovered by the Representative from (i) the
Expense Escrow Amount and (ii) the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Fund at
such time as remaining amounts held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund would
otherwise be distributable to the Effective Time Stockholders; provided, that
while this section allows the Representative to be paid from the Expense
Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the
Effective Time Stockholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. In all questions arising under this Agreement, the Representative
will not be liable to the Company Stockholders who hold securities at or prior
to the Effective Time for anything done or omitted while acting in good faith
and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

(g) _Expense Escrow Fund_. Each Effective Time Stockholder hereby authorizes
Parent (or its designee) to withhold the Expense Escrow Amount from the
amounts otherwise payable to the Effective Time Stockholders pursuant to
_Section 1.7(b)(i)_. The Effective Time Stockholders acknowledge that the
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations
or advice with respect to the Expense Escrow Fund. The Representative shall
have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Expense
Escrow Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. As soon as practicable following the release to the
Effective Time Stockholders of all amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to disburse the balance
of the Expense Escrow Fund to the Payment Agent, who shall then distribute
the balance of the Expense Escrow Fund to the Effective Time Stockholders
based on their respective Pro Rata Portion thereof.

7.4 _Reliance on Representative_. Parent and its respective Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall be
entitled to rely on the appointment of the Representative and treat such
Representative as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Effective Time
Stockholder and as having the duties, power and authority provided for in this
Agreement. None of Parent or its respective Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall be liable to any Effective
Time Stockholder for any actions taken or omitted by them in reliance upon any
instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by the Representative. No
resignation of the

 



-77-   Representative shall become effective unless at least thirty (30) days
prior written notice of the replacement or resignation of such Representative
shall be provided to Parent. Parent and its respective Affiliates (including,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to rely
at any time after receipt of any such notice on the most recent notice so
received. The Effective Time Stockholders who represent a majority in
interest in the Indemnity Escrow Amount may remove the Representative by a
written instrument delivered to the Representative, Parent and the Company,
and, in such event and also if the Representative shall be unable
or unwilling to serve in such capacity, its successor who shall serve and
exercise the powers of the Representative hereunder shall be appointed by a
written instrument signed by the Effective Time Stockholders who represent a
majority in interest in the Indemnity Escrow Amount and delivered to Parent.

ARTICLE VIII.

to the Closing;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, at any time prior to the Closing, if the
Closing Date shall not have occurred by April 30, 2013 (the " _Outside Date_
"); _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose action or failure
to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger
to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes
a breach of this Agreement;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, at any time prior to the Closing, if (i)
any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced
or entered any Law, statute, rule, regulation, executive order or decree

the effect of making the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibits or otherwise restrains the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or (ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued or granted a
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order, or other similar legal restraint, in any such case that has the effect
of making the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
illegal or otherwise prohibits or otherwise restrains the consummation of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and such
order, injunction or restraint shall have become final and nonappealable;

 

(d) by Parent, at any time prior to the Closing, if any Governmental Authority
shall have taken any action, or enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced,
entered or deemed applicable to the Merger any Law, statute, rule, regulation,
executive order or decree (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
has the effect of (i) prohibiting Parents ownership or operation of any
portion of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii)

forth in this Agreement such that, if not cured on or prior to the Closing
Date, the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ would
not be satisfied and such breach has not been cured in all material respects

by its nature cannot be cured, or (y) if a Company Material Adverse Effect
has occurred that is continuing;

(f) by the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, if there has been a

manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of the
parties rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Laws, and any such invalidity, illegality and
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party). In such case, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to replace the

equity and the parties hereby agree to waive any requirements for posting a
bond in connection with any such action.

entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter

THE FOREGOING, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 9.9_ SHALL NOT IN ANY WAY LIMIT
OR OTHERWISE RESTRICT THE RIGHTS OF ANY PARTY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE
OF ACTION UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH FRAUD, OR SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, FRAUD, WILLFUL AND KNOWING BREACH OR
INTENTIONAL BREACH, BY THE COMPANY (OR ANY COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE) IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



-98-  9.10 _Third Parties_. Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended to or
shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement or any other certificate,
document, instrument or agreement executed in connection herewith nor be
relied upon, other than by the parties hereto, the Parent Indemnified Parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

9.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including the validity hereof and the
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the laws of Delaware applicable to contracts
made and to be performed entirely in such state (without giving effect to the
conflicts of laws provisions thereof).

9.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any legal
proceeding by or against any party hereto or with respect to or arising out of
this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
in the State of Delaware. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate courts therefrom solely for
the purposes of disputes arising under the this Agreement and not as a general
submission to such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter
or claim whatsoever. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of
process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the
address for such party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such
service of process shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall
affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Laws. The parties hereto hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action
or proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason, or that it or any of its property is immune from the above-described
legal process, (ii) that such action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that venue for the action or proceeding is improper or
that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, or (iii) any
other defense that would hinder or delay the levy, execution or collection of
any amount to which any party hereto is entitled pursuant to any final
judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Indemnification Claims shall be governed by the terms of _Section 7.2(c)(v)_.

 

9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 

9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (which may be by facsimile or in the form of a .pdf file) and by
the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

 

9.15 _Legal Representation_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree
that, in the event that a dispute arises out of this Agreement after the
Closing between Parent or the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the
Representative or the Effective Time Stockholders, on the other hand, Bryan
Cave HRO (" _BCHRO_ ") may represent any or all of such persons in such
dispute even though the interests of such Persons may be directly adverse to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, and even though
BCHRO formerly may have represented the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
sentence shall not apply to BCHRO, if such firm is handling ongoing matters
for Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
