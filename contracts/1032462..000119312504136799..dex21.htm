owned by the Company or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of the Company or

Ratio_ ") shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any

into CNLRP Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to CNLRP Common Stock or
Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established)
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.



2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall designate
and appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable by CNLRP as agent
for the benefit of the holders of shares of CNLRP Common Stock (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing
shares of CNLRP Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. 



(b) _Company to Provide Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, certificates
representing the Company Common Stock and the Company Series C Preferred Stock
in respect of the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1(a).



(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that represented as of
the Effective Time outstanding shares of CNLRP Common Stock to be exchanged
pursuant to Section 2.2(a), a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Series C Preferred Stock and payment in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Sections 2.1(a) and 2.2(h), after giving effect to any withholding rights
described in Section 2.2(j) below, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall,
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and the other amounts, if any, specified in this
Agreement.



(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the registered holder of the shares of CNLRP
Common Stock  



 

\- 4 -  represented by the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares of CNLRP
Common Stock or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Person_ " means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a
partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization,
including, without limitation, a government or political subdivision or any
agency or instrumentality thereof.



(e) _No Transfers after Effective Time_. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of CNLRP Common Stock.
If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing shares of CNLRP Common
Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Section 2.2.



(f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Company Common Stock or the Company Series
C Preferred Stock, as applicable, constituting all or a portion of the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
representing CNLRP Common Stock until such certificates are surrendered
as provided in this Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the certificates representing the Company Common Stock or the
Company Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time payable prior to or on the date of such surrender
with respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock or the Company
Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable, and not paid, less the amount of any
withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to the date of surrender and a payment
date subsequent to the date of surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Company Common Stock or the Company Series C Preferred Stock, as
applicable, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required
thereon.



(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in CNLRP Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration issued or paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or other
distributions paid pursuant to Sections 2.2(f) or 2.2(h)) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of CNLRP Common Stock.



(h) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the Company.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of CNLRP Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Company Common Stock or
Company Series C Preferred Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such  



 

\- 5 -  holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (rounding up to the nearest
whole cent and without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of
a share of (i) Company Common Stock multiplied by the closing price of
Company Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_
") for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior
to (and excluding the date of) the Effective Time, or (ii) Company Series C
Preferred Stock multiplied by $25.00.



(i) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by law, none of CNLRP, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any holder of shares of CNLRP Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of CNLRP Common Stock two (2) years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental
entity) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(b) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of shares of CNLRP Common Stock six months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged his shares of CNLRP Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(c) prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for his
claim for Company Common Stock, Company Series C Preferred Stock, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series C
Preferred Stock or, as applicable, any dividends or distributions with respect
to Company Common Stock or Company Series C Preferred Stock, as applicable.



(j) _Withholding Rights_. The Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of CNLRP Common Stock such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any other applicable provision of law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
CNLRP Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Company.



(k) _Unvested Shares_. If any shares of CNLRP Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with CNLRP, then the
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series C Preferred Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of CNLRP Common Stock shall also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Series C Preferred Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate
legends. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation is entitled
to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

Section 401(a) of the Code has received determination letters from the IRS to
the effect that such Company Employee Plan is qualified and the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections

been threatened. No deadline has passed to file a determination letter
request with respect to any amendments not covered by the before-described

the Companys Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Company Employee Plan
by any Governmental Entity. The Company has incurred no tax liability under

Sections 502(i) or (l) of ERISA.

 



 

\- 22 - (e) Neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) ever
maintained an Company Employee Plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of
the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company
Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary
employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code.



 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

other employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) the benefits of
which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered, upon the
occurrence of a transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(B) providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee or (ii)
agreement, plan or arrangement under which any person may receive payments

(g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement
by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan that would result
in a material increase in the expense of maintaining such Company Employee
Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal
year of the Company ended prior to the date hereof. Neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has any plan or commitment, whether legally binding or
not, to create any additional Company Employee Plan, or to modify or change
any existing Company Employee Plan that would affect any employee or
terminated employee of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA
Affiliate.



(h) There has been no nonexempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to
any Company Employee Plan; except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
there are not any current or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, charges or other
encumbrances of any nature on the assets of any Company Employee Plan; the
transactions contemplated herein will not directly or indirectly result in an
increase of benefits, acceleration of vesting or acceleration of timing for
payment of any benefit to any participant or beneficiary, except as disclosed
in Section 3.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. No claims have been
made, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, after due inquiry, are expected
with respect to any bond or any fiduciary or other similar insurance with
regard to the actions of any person in connection with any Benefit Plan, nor
has there been, nor is there, to the Knowledge of the Company, after due
inquiry, threatened any notice to any insurer under any such bond or policy
with regard to any of such plans. No application for any bond or for any
fiduciary or similar insurance policy has been issued subject to any
qualification, condition or exclusion. No assets of any Company Employee Plan
are invested, directly or indirectly, in real or personal property used by
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. There is sufficient liquidity of assets in
each of the funded Company Employee Plans to promptly pay for the benefits
earned and other liabilities owed (in each case, in the ordinary course of
plan activities) under such Company Employee  



 

\- 23 -  Plan. With respect to each Company Employee Plan, no insurance contract,
annuity contract, or other agreement or arrangement with any financial or
other organization would impose any penalty, discount or other reduction on
account of the withdrawal of assets from such organization or the change in
the investment of such assets.



(i) Each Company Employee Plan that is a "group health plan" (within the
meaning of Code Section 5000(b)(1)) has been operated in compliance in all

to provide health care coverage, medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or
similar benefits (whether or not insured) to any employee or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following such employees or former
employees termination of employment with the Company or any Subsidiary, other

failures of compliance, defaults and violations which could not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

under any applicable law or otherwise, as a result of or in connection with

\- 25 -  obligations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of

Company Insurance Policies will terminate or lapse by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with the provisions of each Company
Insurance Policy under which it is the insured party. No insurer under any
Company Insurance Policy has canceled or generally disclaimed liability under
any such policy or indicated any intent to do so or not to renew any such
policy. All material claims under the Company Insurance Policies have been
filed in a timely fashion, in each case except as is not reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

"), financial advisor to the Special Committee of the Company Board (the "

\- 26 -  aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect (the " _Company Permits_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except where the failure to
so comply, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no pending threat of modification
or cancellation of any Company Permit that, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
Companys Knowledge and except to the extent caused by the lack of one or more
approvals, notifications, reports or other filings set forth in Section
3.3(c) of this Agreement, no Company Permit will cease to be effective as a

(ii) were or will be prepared in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, applicable to such CNLRP SEC Reports. None of CNLRP SEC Reports
when filed, after giving effect to any amendments and supplements thereto
filed prior to the date hereof, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of CNLRPs
Subsidiaries has filed, or is obligated to file, any forms, reports,
schedules, statements or other documents with the SEC. As used in this
Section 3.4(a), the term "filed" shall be broadly construed to include  



 

\- 34 -  any manner in which a document or information is furnished, supplied or
otherwise made available to the SEC.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes and schedules) contained or to be contained in CNLRP SEC
Reports (i) complied or will comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were or will be prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the
Exchange Act or for normal year-end adjustments) and (iii) fairly presented or
will fairly present the financial position of CNLRP as of the dates thereof
and the results of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated,

June 30, 2004 is referred to herein as the " _CNLRP Balance Sheet_."



(c) CNLRP has established and maintained (i) disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) and
(ii) internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act). To CNLRPs Knowledge, (i) such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information
relating to CNLRP, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
the CNLRPs senior management by others within those entities, particularly
during the period when the CNLRPs periodic reports to which such information
relates are required to be prepared, (ii) such internal control over
financial reporting provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, (iii) there are no significant deficiencies
or material weaknesses in the design or operation of CNLRPs internal control
over financial reporting which could adversely affect CNLRPs ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and (iv) there is no
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in CNLRPs internal control over financial
reporting. The Company has made available to CNLRP, complete and correct
copies of, all formally written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and
other documents promulgating, such disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting.

Statement, shall not at the time the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement
or necessary in order to make the statements in the Registration Statement
not misleading. The information to be supplied by CNLRP for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement to be sent to the stockholders of CNLRP in connection with the
Company Meeting and CNLRP Meeting shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement
is first mailed to stockholders of CNLRP and CNLRP, at the time of the Company
Meeting and CNLRP Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any statement
which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be
made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the
 



 

\- 35 -  Proxy Statement not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect
to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Meeting or CNLRP Meeting which
has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event relating to CNLRP or any Affiliate (as defined below) of CNLRP, officers
or directors should be discovered by CNLRP which should be set forth in an
amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, CNLRP shall promptly inform CNLRP. The Proxy Statement shall comply

except liabilities or obligations (i) disclosed in CNLRP SEC Reports filed
and publicly available prior to the date hereof or (ii) incurred in the

not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a CNLRP
Material Adverse Effect.

is outstanding or may be incurred and the respective principal amounts
outstanding thereunder as of the date of this Agreement.



4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.



(a) Except as disclosed in CNLRP SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, there has not been, after the date of CNLRP Balance Sheet and prior
to the date of this Agreement, any change, development, circumstance,
condition, event, occurrence, damage, destruction or loss that has had or
could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
CNLRP Material Adverse Effect.



(b) During the period from June 30, 2004 to the date hereof, (i) there has not
been any change by CNLRP in its accounting methods, principles or practices,
any revaluation by CNLRP of any of its assets, including, writing down the

in full force and effect.



(c) There has been no physical damage to any CNLRP Properties which,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a CNLRP Material Adverse Effect
after giving effect to any applicable insurance.



(d) Neither CNLRP nor any of CNLRP Subsidiaries nor, to CNLRPs Knowledge, any
tenant under a CNLRP Lease has received any notice with respect to any CNLRP
Property to the effect that any condemnation or rezoning proceedings are

4.10 _Taxes_.



(a) Each of CNLRP and the Subsidiaries of CNLRP and any consolidated,
combined, unitary or aggregate group for tax purposes of which CNLRP or any
Subsidiary of CNLRP is or has been a member has timely filed all federal
income Tax Return and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by
it (after giving effect to any filed extension properly granted by a Tax
Authority having authority to do so) and has timely paid all Taxes shown on
such Tax Returns as required to be paid by it except Taxes that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which CNLRP or the
applicable CNLRP Subsidiary shall have set aside on its books adequate
reserves.



(b) Each such Tax Return is true, complete and accurate in all material
respects. CNLRP Balance Sheet reflects an adequate reserve for all Taxes
payable by CNLRP and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through June 30, 2004. Since the date of CNLRP Balance Sheet, CNLRP
has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 857(f), 860(c) or
4981 of the Code, including without limitation any Tax arising from a
prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither
CNLRP nor any Subsidiary of CNLRP has incurred any liability for Taxes other
than in the ordinary course of business. No material deficiencies for any
Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against CNLRP or any Subsidiary
of CNLRP, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are
pending and no extensions of time to assess any such Taxes are in effect.



(c) All Taxes required to be withheld, collected and paid over to any Tax
Authority by CNLRP and any Subsidiary of CNLRP have been timely withheld,
collected and  



 

\- 38 -  paid over to the proper Tax Authority. There are no pending actions or
proceedings by any Taxing Authority for assessment or collection of any Tax. 



(d) Complete copies of all federal, state and local income or franchise Tax
Returns that have been filed by CNLRP and each Subsidiary of CNLRP for all
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, any extensions filed with
any Tax Authority that are currently in effect and all written communications
with a Taxing Authority relating thereto, have been made available to the
Company. CNLRP has not received notice of any claim by a Taxing Authority in a
jurisdiction where CNLRP or any Subsidiary of CNLRP does not file Tax
Returns that it is subject to taxation by the jurisdiction except where the
failure to file such Tax Return or to be subject to taxation could not
reasonably be expected to have a CNLRP Material Adverse Effect.



(e) Neither CNLRP, nor any Subsidiary of CNLRP is obligated to make after the
Closing any payment that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 162(m)
or 280G of the Code. Other than with respect to its Subsidiaries, CNLRP is not
and has never been (nor does CNLRP have any liability for unpaid
Taxes because it once was) a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined
or unitary group, and neither CNLRP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or is liable for the Taxes of any
other person under Treasury Regulations §1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law), as transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise.



(f) CNLRP has not been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable
period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Neither CNLRP nor
any of its Subsidiaries has made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code.



(g) None of CNLRP and its Subsidiaries will be required to include any
material amount in taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending after the Closing Date as a result of a change in the method of
accounting for a taxable period ending prior to the Closing Date, any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Laws) entered into prior to the
Closing Date, any sale reported on the installment method that occurred prior
to the Closing Date, or any taxable income attributable to any amount that is
economically accrued prior to the Closing Date.



(h) CNLRP (i) for all taxable years commencing with its initial taxable year
through December 31, 2003 has been operated so as to qualify as a real estate
investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code
and has been so qualified as a REIT for such years, (ii) and will continue to
operate to the Closing, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the
taxable year beginning January 1, 2004 determined as if the taxable year of
the REIT ended as of the Closing and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take
any action which would result in a challenge to its status as a REIT, and no
such challenge is pending or to CNLRPs Knowledge threatened. Each Subsidiary
of CNLRP which is a partnership or limited liability company (i) has been
since its formation and continues to be treated for federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded as a separate entity, as the case may
be, and has not been treated for federal income tax purposes as a corporation
or an association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of
its formation or the acquisition by CNLRP of a  



 

\- 39 -  direct or indirect interest therein owned any assets (including, without
limitation, securities) that would cause CNLRP to violate Section 856(c)(4) of
the Code. The nature of the assets of CNLRP and the Subsidiaries of CNLRP is
such that the sale of all of the assets owned by them would not cause CNLRP to
be disqualified as a REIT under Code Section 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) or
otherwise. Each Subsidiary of CNLRP that is a corporation either (i) has been
since its formation a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the
Code or (ii) has been since January 1, 2001, a taxable REIT subsidiary under
Section 856(1) of the Code.



4.11 _Intellectual Property_. CNLRP and the Subsidiaries of CNLRP have sole
title to and ownership of, or possesses legally enforceable rights to use
under valid and subsisting written license agreements, all Intellectual
Property of CNLRP. Neither CNLRP nor any of its Subsidiaries has
misappropriated, is conflict with or is infringing upon the Intellectual
Property of others.



4.12 _Litigation_. Except as described in Section 4.12 of CNLRP Disclosure
Schedule or expressly described in CNLRP SEC Reports filed and publicly
available prior to the date hereof, there is no Proceeding pending or, to
CNLRPs Knowledge, threatened against CNLRP or any of the Subsidiaries which,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a CNLRP Material Adverse Effect.
There are no judgments, orders or decrees outstanding against CNLRP which,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a CNLRP Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Schedule 4.12 to CNLRPs Disclosure Schedule sets forth each and every
material uninsured claim, equal employment opportunity claim and claim
relating to sexual harassment and/or discrimination pending or, to the
Knowledge of CNLRP, threatened as of the date hereof, in each case with a
brief summary of such claim or threatened claim and (ii) no claim has
been made under any directors and officers liability insurance policy at
any time by CNLRP or any Subsidiary.



4.13 _Environmental Matters_. Except for such matters which have not had or
could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
CNLRP Material Adverse Effect:

CNLRPs and each of its Subsidiaries ownership or operation of their
businesses and properties, have been, in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws; 



(b) no Environmental Claims have been asserted or assessed against CNLRP, any

Subsidiaries or any tenants under any of CNLRP Leases with regard to any of

Knowledge, any other list, schedule, log, inventory or record, however
defined, maintained by any federal, state or local Governmental Entity with
respect to sites from which there is or has been a Release of a Hazardous
Substance;



 

\- 40 - (d) there was no Contamination at any property formerly owned, leased or
operated by CNLRP or any of its Subsidiaries during, or to CNLRPs Knowledge,
prior to the period of ownership or operation by CNLRP or any of its
Subsidiaries (including soils, groundwater, surface water in, on or under such
properties), and no such property is on the National Priorities List or, to
CNLRPs Knowledge, any other list, schedule, log, inventory or record, however
defined, maintained by any federal, state or local Governmental Entity with
respect to sites from which there is or has been a Release of a Hazardous
Substance;



(e) neither CNLRP nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to CNLRPs Knowledge, any
tenant of any CNLRP Property is subject to any orders, decrees, injunctions or
other arrangements with any Governmental Entity or is subject to any

any Environmental Law or relating to Hazardous Substances that obligates or
may obligate CNLRP or any of its Subsidiaries to pay money;



(f) To CNLRPs Knowledge, there are no events, conditions, circumstances,
practices, plans, or legal requirements (in effect or reasonably anticipated),
that could be expected to prevent CNLRP from, or materially increase the
burden on CNLRP of complying with applicable Environmental Laws; and 



(g) CNLRP has made available to the Company, prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, complete copies of any and all Environmental
Documents pertaining to CNLRP Properties.

4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) Each Employee Benefit Plan maintained, or contributed to, by CNLRP, any
Subsidiary of CNLRP or any ERISA Affiliate of CNLRP (a " _CNLRP ERISA
Affiliate_ ") (such plans together, the " _CNLRP Employee Plans_ ") has been
complies and has at all times complied, in form and in operation and
administration, in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
each of CNLRP, CNLRPs Subsidiaries and CNLRP ERISA Affiliates has in all
material respects met its obligations with respect to such CNLRP Employee Plan
and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved
such contributions on CNLRP Balance Sheet), in each case except as would not
cause a CNLRP Material Adverse Effect.



(b) With respect to CNLRP Employee Plans, there are no funded benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued
and there are no unfunded benefit obligations which have not been accounted
for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on
the financial statements of CNLRP, in each case except as would not cause a
CNLRP Material Adverse Effect.



(c) Each of CNLRP Employee Plans that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received determination letters from the IRS to
the effect that such CNLRP Employee Plans is qualified and the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such  



 

\- 41 -  determination letter has been revoked and, to CNLRPs Knowledge, revocation
has not been threatened. No deadline has passed to file a
determination letter request with respect to any amendments not covered by
the before-described those determination letters.

412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute
to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No
CNLRP Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary
employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code.



(e) There has been no nonexempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to

claims, pledges, agreements, charges or other encumbrances of any nature on
the assets of any CNLRP Employee Plan; the transactions contemplated herein
will not directly or indirectly result in an increase of benefits,
acceleration of vesting or acceleration of timing for payment of any benefit
to any participant or beneficiary, except as disclosed in Section 4.14(e) of
CNLRP Disclosure Schedule. No claims have been made, or, to the Knowledge of
CNLRP, after due inquiry, are expected with respect to any bond or any
fiduciary or other similar insurance with regard to the actions of any person
in connection with any CNLRP Employee Plan, nor has there been, nor is there,
to the Knowledge of CNLRP, after due inquiry, threatened any notice to any
insurer under any such bond or policy with regard to any of such plans. No
application for any bond or for any fiduciary or similar insurance policy has
been issued subject to any qualification, condition or exclusion. No assets of
any CNLRP Employee Plan are invested, directly or indirectly, in real or
personal property used by CNLRP or any ERISA Affiliate. There is sufficient
liquidity of assets in each of the funded CNLRP Employee Plans to promptly pay
for the benefits earned and other liabilities owed (in each case, in the
ordinary course of plan activities) under such CNLRP Employee Plan. With
respect to each CNLRP Employee Plan, no insurance contract, annuity contract,
or other agreement or arrangement with any financial or other organization
would impose any penalty, discount or other reduction on account of the
withdrawal of assets from such organization or the change in the investment of
such assets.

written (i) agreement with any stockholders, director, executive officer or
other key employee of CNLRP or any of its Subsidiaries (A) the benefits of

payment" under Section 280G of the Code.



4.15 _Compliance_. CNLRP and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
(i) the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended or

regulations applicable to CNLRP or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their properties or assets; except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of
this Section 4.15, for any such failures of compliance, defaults and
violations which could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither CNLRP nor any of its

connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder or as a result of
the termination by CNLRP or any Subsidiary of any persons employed by CNLRP

employee, or other individual or any Governmental Entity with respect to
employment practices brought by or before any Governmental Entity.

strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, disputes, lockouts, or threats thereof, by
or with respect to any employees of CNLRP or any of its Subsidiaries. There
are no grievances pending or, to CNLRPs Knowledge, threatened, which, if
adversely decided, could reasonably be expected to have a CNLRP Material
Adverse Effect. Neither CNLRP nor any Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise
bound by, any consent decree with, or citation or other order by, any
Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment practices. CNLRP and
each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable laws, contracts, and policies relating to employment, employment
practices, wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, including the
obligations of WARN, and all other notification and bargaining obligations
arising under any collective bargaining agreement, by law or otherwise.

"mass layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN, affecting in whole or in
part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee of CNLRP,

with the provisions of each CNLRP Insurance Policy under which it is
the insured party. No insurer under any CNLRP Insurance Policy has canceled
or generally disclaimed liability under any such policy or indicated any
intent to do so or not to renew any such policy. All material claims under
CNLRP Insurance Policies have been filed in a timely fashion, in each case
except as is not reasonably likely to have a CNLRP Material Adverse Effect.

_BofA_ ") and Legg Mason Wood Walker, Incorporated (" _LM_ "), financial
advisors to the Special Committee of the CNLRP Board (the " _CNLRP Special

Board of Directors of CNLRP (the " _CNLRP Board_ ") an opinion to the effect

Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its
directors and officers as of the Effective Time and any indemnification
provisions under the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws as
in effect on the date hereof. The provisions of the Restated Articles of
Incorporation, as amended and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation with
respect to indemnification and exculpation of directors and officers shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at any time prior to the Effective Time, were directors
or officers of the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to  



 

\- 57 -  the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by law.

 



(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors and

damages, liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement of, with the
approval of the Surviving Corporation, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, or otherwise in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, including liabilities in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with
respect to which the Surviving Corporation has withheld settlement approval (a
" _Claim_ "), based in whole or in part on the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of the Company and arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except for acts
or omissions involving willful or intentional misconduct or recklessness by
such Indemnified Party, and shall pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party upon
receipt from the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced of an
undertaking to repay such advances as they shall ultimately be determined in a

Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any Claim is brought against any
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Indemnified Parties may retain independent legal counsel satisfactory to
them provided that such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation, (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as

its reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter.

upon learning of any Claim, shall notify the Surviving Corporation, although
the failure to so notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the
Surviving Corporation of any liability which the Surviving Corporation may
have under this Section 6.9 (except to the extent that such failure
materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation), and shall deliver the
Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by this subsection (b).



(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, CNLRP shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect a directors and officers
liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (complete
and accurate copies of which has been delivered to CNLRP prior to the date of
this Agreement) with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable to
such persons as the Companys respective existing coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be required, in order to
maintain such directors and officers liability insurance policy, to pay an
annual premium in excess of 125% of the aggregate annual amounts currently
paid by the Company to maintain the existing policies; and provided further
that, if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by
paying an annual premium in excess of 125% of such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be
obtained by paying an annual premium equal to 125% of such amount.



 

\- 58 - (d) This Section 6.8 is intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal representatives, and
shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns.

Company, and the Company will give prompt notice to CNLRP, of the occurrence,
or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would
be reasonably likely to cause (a) (i) any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality to be
untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of CNLRP
or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or
agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 will not

plans. CNLRP will cause the Surviving Corporation to take whatever
actions (including adopting the plans) might be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate this result. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
parties specifically agree that CNLRP will cause the Surviving Corporation to
assume sponsorship of the CNL American Properties Fund, Inc. 1999 Performance
Incentive Plan.



6.19 _Payments Related to Failure to Close Income Fund Mergers_.



(a) Section 7.3(h) of each Income Fund Merger Agreement requires, as a
condition of the Companys obligations to close the respective Income Fund
Merger, the receipt by the Company of certain financing. CNLRP acknowledges
that it will diligently work in good faith with the Company to obtain such
financing. Section 8.4(d) of each Income Fund Merger Agreement requires that
the Company pay the respective Income Fund a fee in the event that the
Company terminates the Income Fund Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(n)
thereof because of the failure of Section 7.3(h) to be satisfied. In the event
that the Company terminates any Income Fund Merger Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(n) thereof solely because of the failure of Section 7.3(h) thereof
to be satisfied, then upon receipt of written notice of such termination from
the Company and payment by the Company of any required amounts under each
Income Fund Merger Agreement, CNLRP shall pay to the Company an amount equal
to $2,000,000 multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the purchase
price for the Income Fund and the denominator of which is the aggregate
purchase price for all of the Income Funds. The fee shall be paid by CNLRP to
the Company, in immediately available funds, within two (2) business days
after the receipt of written notice of such termination.



(b) Section 8.1(b) of each Income Fund Merger Agreement requires the Income
Fund pay to the Company a break-up fee in the event the Income Fund terminates
the Income Fund Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(k) thereof. In the
event that the Company receives any payments from the Income Funds pursuant
to Section 8.1(b) of the Income Fund Merger Agreements, the Company shall pay
CNLRP an amount equal to one-half of all such payments . Any such amounts
shall be paid by the Company to CNLRP, in immediately available funds, within
two (2) business days after the receipt by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(b) of the Income Fund Merger Agreements.



6.20 _Bridge Financing_. The Company shall use its best efforts to obtain no
later than October 30, 2004 a commitment letter (the " _Commitment Letter_ ")
expiring no earlier than January 30, 2005, from a reputable financial
institution in substantially the same form and substance as Exhibit G attached
hereto, to provide financing on terms and conditions no less favorable than
those described on _Exhibit G_ attached hereto.

\- 68 - 8.4 _Certain Fees and Expenses_.



(a) If this Agreement shall be terminated (i) pursuant to Sections 8.1(e) or
8.1(g), then the Company thereupon shall pay to CNLRP the Break-Up Fee (as
defined below) and (ii) pursuant to Section 8.1(h) or 8.1(j), then the Company
shall pay to CNLRP (provided that the Company was not entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i) at the time of such termination) an
amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses (as defined herein).



(b) If this Agreement shall be terminated (i) pursuant to Sections 8.1(f) or
8.1(l), then CNLRP thereupon shall pay to the Company the Break-Up Fee (as
defined below) and (ii) pursuant to Section 8.1(i) or 8.1(k), then CNLRP shall
pay to the Company (provided that CNLRP was not entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) at the time of such termination)
an amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses (as defined herein).



(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(b) (if
primarily resulting from any action or inaction of the Company), 8.1(d) or
8.1(e) and prior to the time of such termination an Acquisition Proposal has
been received by the Company, and either prior to the termination of this
Agreement or within two years thereafter, the Company enters into any written
agreement to consummate a transaction or series of transactions which, had
such agreement been proposed or negotiated during the term of this Agreement,
would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "), then the Company shall pay the Break-Up Fee to CNLRP upon
the execution by the Company thereof.



(d) The payment of the Break-Up Fee shall be full compensation for the loss
suffered by CNLRP or the Company (as applicable) as a result of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated (including, without limitation, opportunity costs
and out-of-pocket costs and expenses) and to avoid the difficulty of
determining damages under the circumstances. The Break-Up Fee or the Break-Up
Expenses shall be paid by the Company to CNLRP or CNLRP to the Company (as
applicable), in immediately available funds within two (2) business days
after the date the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment
occurred. The Company and CNLRP each acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.4 are integral parts of this Agreement; accordingly, if
CNLRP or the Company (as applicable) fails to promptly pay the Break-Up Fee or
Break-Up Expenses due pursuant to this Section 8.4 and, in order to obtain
payment, CNLRP or the Company (as applicable) commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the other for any amounts owed pursuant to this Section
8.4, the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount owed at the prime rate of Bank of
America, N.A. Payment of the fees described in Section 8.4 shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement.



(e) As used in this Agreement, " _Break-Up Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) $20,000,000 less Break-Up Expenses paid or payable under
this Section 8.4 (the " _Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum
amount that can be paid to CNLRP or the Company, as the case may be (the "
_Recipient_ ") without causing the Recipient to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and
856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by
independent accountants to the Recipient, and  



 

\- 69 -  (B) in the event the Recipient receives a letter from outside counsel (the "
_Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion_ ") indicating that the Recipient has received a
ruling from the IRS holding that the Recipient receipt of the Base Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income of the Recipient within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ ") or that the receipt by the Recipient
of the remaining balance of the Base Amount following the receipt of and
pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed constructively received prior
thereto, the Base Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. The
obligation of CNLRP or the Company, as the case may be, to pay (the " _Payor_
") any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate two years from the
date of this Agreement. In the event that the Recipient is not able to
receive the full Base Amount, the Payor shall place the unpaid amount in
escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the Recipient unless and
until the Payor receives either one of the following: (i) a letter from the
Payors independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid
at that time to the Recipient without causing the Recipient to fail to meet
the REIT Requirements or (ii) a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion, in either of which
events the Payor shall pay to the Recipient the lesser of the unpaid Base
Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above.



 

(f) The " _Break-Up Expenses_ " payable to the Recipient, shall be an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 and (ii) the Recipients out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, all attorneys,
accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses). If the Break-Up
Expenses payable to the Recipient exceed the maximum amount that can be paid
to the Recipient without causing the Recipient to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, as
determined by independent accountants to the Recipient (the " _Maximum Amount_
"), the amount initially payable to the Recipient shall be limited to the
Maximum Amount. If, however, within the two-year period commencing on the
date of this Agreement, the Recipient receives a letter from outside counsel
(the " _Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion_ ") indicating that it has received a
ruling from the IRS holding that the Recipients receipt of the Break-Up
Expenses would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from
gross income of the Recipient within the meaning of the REIT Requirements or
that receipt by the Recipient of the balance of the Break-Up Expenses above
the Maximum Amount following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would
not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Recipient shall be
entitled to have payable to it the full amount of the Break-Up Expenses. The
obligation of the Payor to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Expenses
shall terminate two years from the date of this Agreement. In the event that
the Recipient is not able to receive the full Break-Up Expenses, the Payor
shall place the unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any portion
thereof to the Recipient unless and until the Payor receives either one of the
following: (i) a letter from the independent accountants of CNLRP or the
Company, as the case may be, indicating the maximum amount that can be paid
at that time to the Recipient without causing it to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements or (ii) a Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion, in either of which events
the Payor shall pay to the Recipient the lesser of the unpaid Break-Up
Expenses or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above.



(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 8.4, in the event the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(m), the Company
shall pay a termination fee equal to CNLRP $2,500,000 in immediately available
funds within two (2)  



 

\- 70 -  business days after the receipt of notice by CNLRP that the Company is
exercising its right of termination pursuant to such provision.



8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, _provided_ , _however_ , that,
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires
further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. 



8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein, _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, after any such approval, no extension or waiver shall be made which by
law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party.

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
hereto and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations
by or between the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with
respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.



 

\- 72 - 9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.8, this
Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.



9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.



9.6  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties agree hereto that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the parties with respect to the
invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.



9.7  _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each party hereto and
delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not
sign the same counterpart.



9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form
of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference
to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation".



 

\- 73 - 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Maryland without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Maryland.



9.10 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right.



9.11 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity
upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.



9.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal
court of competent jurisdiction of the State of Maryland in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (d)
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in
any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing
in this Section, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law.



9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. CNLRP AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE
ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF CNLRP OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
