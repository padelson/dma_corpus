severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this
Agreement, (ii) accelerate

to, applying to the IRS for a determination letter related to such termination
and making any plan amendments, shall be taken following the Closing Date by
the Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries, Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser, as determined by Purchaser.

7.6 _Certain Intercompany Matters_. Except as contemplated by any of the

provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries) to any of the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries, (b) all services provided to Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries) by any of the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries and (c) all agreements between

Subsidiaries) on the one hand,

 



-46-   and any of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
in each case shall be terminated as of immediately prior to the Closing
without payment or incurrence of further liability or obligation (contingent
or otherwise) thereunder.

7.7 _Non-Solicitation_. (a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date, and except as
otherwise required or permitted by any Ancillary Agreement, Seller and its
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Restricted Entities_ ") shall not, directly
or indirectly:

(i) Induce, solicit or encourage, or attempt to induce, solicit or encourage,
any Restricted Customer to (1) use a Restricted Entity to provide any services
which are offered by the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date (the " _Restricted Services_ ") or (2) reduce, terminate or
adversely modify the employment of the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries for such services, in each case other than as a consequence of a
general solicitation conducted by a Restricted Entity not
specifically directed at Restricted Customers; or

(ii) Solicit, hire or attempt to solicit or hire any Continuing Employee for
employment or in any other capacity (including as an independent contractor or
consultant) with a Restricted Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to any (1) individual whose employment or service
was terminated by the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries, (2)
publishing or posting of open positions in the course of normal hiring
practices which are not specifically sent to, or do not specifically target,
Continuing Employees or hiring as a result of such posting, (3) solicitations
made by third-party search firms that have not been directed by Seller or its
Affiliates to specifically solicit such individuals or hiring as a result of
such solicitations, or (4) individual who approaches a Restricted Entity
seeking to be hired as an employee or in another capacity (including as an
independent contractor or consultant) if no Restricted Entity had previously
attempted to solicit or hire such individual.

 

(b) Purchaser agrees that from the date hereof until the 18-month anniversary
of the Closing Date it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, hire or attempt to solicit or hire any employee of Seller
or any of its Affiliates who is not a Continuing Employee for employment or
in any other capacity (including as an independent contractor or consultant);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any (i)
individual whose employment or service was terminated by Seller or its
Affiliates, (ii) publishing or posting of open positions in the course of
normal hiring practices which are not specifically sent to, or do not
specifically target, employees of Seller or its Affiliates or hiring as a
result of such posting, or (iii) solicitations made by third-party search
firms that have not been directed by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to specifically solicit such
individuals or hiring as a result of such solicitations.

(c) The parties acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this _Section
7.7_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for the
agreement of each party to comply with these covenants, the other party would
not have entered into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that this
_Section 7.7_ constitutes an independent covenant that shall not be affected
by performance or nonperformance of any other

 



-47-   provision of this Agreement. The existence of any claim or cause of action
against one party by the other party, whether predicated on the breach of this
Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of
the covenants contained in this _Section 7.7_. The parties have independently
consulted with their respective counsel and after such consultation agree that
the covenants set forth in this  _Section 7.7_ are reasonable and proper in
scope, duration, geographical area and in all other respects. If any such
covenant is found to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction by a final determination of a court or any other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction, Seller and Purchaser agree that: (i) such
determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of (1) the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction or (2) the remaining terms and provisions of this _Section 7.7_
in any situation in any jurisdiction; (ii) the offending term or provision
shall be reformed rather than voided and the court or Governmental Authority
making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration
or geographical area of any invalid or unenforceable term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
enforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable provision, in order to render the restrictive covenants set
forth in this  _Section 7.7_ enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law; and (iii) the restrictive covenants set forth in this _Section
7.7_ shall be enforceable as so modified.

 

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur if this _Section 7.7_ were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms and that any breach of this _Section 7.7_ by the other party
could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.
Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which such party may
be entitled, at law or in equity or under this Agreement, such party shall be
entitled to enforce this _Section 7.7_ by a decree of specific performance
and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this _Section 7.7_, without
posting any bond or other undertaking.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the restrictions imposed by
applicable subsections of this _Section 7.7_ shall apply to any Person that
is an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement if such Person ceases to be an
Affiliate of such party. 

7.8 _Insurance_. (a) From and after the Closing Date, the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by Sellers or its
Affiliates (other than the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries) blanket
insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs. After the Closing
Date, to the extent that any claim has been made under any of the insurance
policies of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries) that relates to the conduct of business by the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date and an
accrual for such claim is reflected in the Companies unaudited consolidated
balance sheet (excluding MAM and the Trust Department) as of the Closing Date,
Seller agrees that any recovery with respect to any such claims (net of
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates) shall be
promptly paid to Purchaser.

(b) With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date
that are covered by occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policies
and any workers compensation insurance policies or comparable workers
compensation self-insurance programs sponsored by Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Companies and the

 



-48-   Transferred Subsidiaries), the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries
may make claims after the Closing Date under such policies and programs;
_provided_ , _however_ , that by making any such claims, Purchaser agrees to
reimburse Seller for any increased costs incurred by Seller or its Affiliates
as a result of such claims, including any retroactive or prospective premium
adjustments associated with such coverage, as such amounts are determined in
accordance with those policies and programs generally applicable from time to
time to Seller or its Affiliates. As of the first anniversary of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall no longer have access to such occurrence-
based third-party liability insurance policies of Seller and its Affiliates
or to such workers compensation insurance policies or comparable workers
compensation self-insurance programs that apply to the locations at which the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries operated prior to the Closing
Date, and Purchaser shall assume full responsibility for, and release Seller
and its Affiliates from, all liability for claims, known or unknown, resulting
from occurrences prior to the Closing Date.

respective reasonable best efforts to promptly negotiate in good faith and

Sellers Disclosure Schedules (the " _Continuing Services Agreements_ ");

 

(ii) A customary transition services agreement (the " _Transition Services

sweep arrangements as discussed in  _Section 7.28(b)_; and

(v) A fiduciary assets transfer agreement (the " _Fiduciary Assets Transfer
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, at Purchasers reasonable and customary
expense, Regions Bank will cooperate with a designated Affiliate of Purchaser
to facilitate the transfer of such assets from Regions Bank to such
Affiliate of Purchaser (subject to obtaining any required customer, grantor,
beneficiary or other consent).

(b) At the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates that
is a party to any Ancillary Agreement to, execute and deliver such Ancillary
Agreement to which it is a party, and Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates that is a party to any Ancillary Agreement to, execute and
deliver such Ancillary Agreement.

7.10 _Notice of Developments_. Prior to the Closing, Seller and Purchaser
agree to promptly notify the other in case of a development that is reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable.

 



-49-  7.11 _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing Date, Seller (as
reasonably requested from time to time by Purchaser) and Purchaser (as
reasonably requested from time to time by Seller) shall take all reasonably
appropriate action and execute any additional documents, instruments or
conveyances of any kind (not containing additional representations and
warranties) which may be reasonably necessary to carry out any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

7.12 _Transfer of MAM_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause (a) MAM to transfer all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of MAMs Subsidiary to MK Holding
and (b) MK Holding to transfer all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of MAM to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries) (clauses (a) and (b), collectively, the " _MAM
Restructuring_ "); _provided_ that all costs of such transfer shall be borne
solely by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries).

 

7.13 _Confidentiality_. The parties agree that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any termination
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement pursuant to its terms; _provided_ that the confidentiality and
use provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive until the fifth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement (notwithstanding any earlier
termination date in respect of the confidentiality and use provisions set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement). Purchaser hereby consents to the
receipt of Employee Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
pursuant to Section 4 of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

7.14 _Publicity; Notices_. Until the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall
coordinate with each other as soon as practicable in advance as to (a) the
form and content of any external communication, including any communication
intended for dissemination or to reach, or reasonably expected to be
disseminated or to reach, members of the public regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) the form and content of
any communication from Purchaser to any Continuing Employee. Neither party
shall disseminate any such communication without adequate advance notice and
the prior consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, except that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
parties hereto from making any and all public disclosures legally required to
comply with any applicable securities laws or regulations or requests of
Governmental Authorities; _provided_ that, to the extent possible under the
circumstances, the party making such disclosure consults with the other party,
and considers in good faith the views of the other party, before doing so.
Notice and consent given in connection with this Section 7.14 may be given by
email to one or more individuals designated by each of the parties hereto.

7.15 _Director Indemnification; Exculpation_. (a) All rights to
indemnification for and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of any employees
of Seller or any of its Affiliates currently or formerly serving as directors
of any of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective predecessor entities) or any employees of Seller or any of
its Affiliates who become prior to the Closing a director of any of the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Director_
") as provided in the Constituent Documents of each such Person, or in any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Director and such Person
(in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement), shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their 

 



-50-   respective terms for a period of six years from the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action
asserted or made prior to the Closing or within such six-year period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Action.

(b) From and after the Closing until the sixth anniversary thereof, the
Constituent Documents of each of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
Indemnified Directors than are presently set forth in such Constituent
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any such individuals.

 

(c) In the event that, after the Closing, any of the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries (or their respective successors or assigns) (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Purchaser shall cause such
Company or such Transferred Subsidiary, as applicable, to cause proper
provision to be made so that such successors and assigns shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.15_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.15_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Director and his or her heirs
and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have from any of
the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries or any other person by contract
or otherwise except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

(e) Concurrently with the Closing, Purchaser shall release, on behalf of
itself and each of its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries), each Indemnified Director who is not an Employee of the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries from and against any and all past,
existing or future, claims, demands, obligations and liabilities, whether
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, at law or in equity, arising
from or related to any act or omission by any of those individuals in their
capacity of directors or officers of any of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing (" _Pre-Closing Claims_ "). Purchaser
also acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, prior to the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to cause the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries to release each Indemnified
Director and each other such Person referred to in the prior sentence from
all Pre-Closing Claims.

7.16 _Release of Guarantees_. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with
Seller prior to the Closing Date in Sellers efforts to terminate as of the
Closing, all guarantees or commitments by Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) of specified obligations of
any of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries under any agreements to
which any of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries is a party (the "
_Seller Performance Guarantees_ "), including if requested by the relevant
beneficiary of such Seller Performance Guarantee following discussions between
such beneficiary and Purchaser, by offering guarantees, support or other
security arrangements reasonably acceptable to the relevant beneficiary of
such Seller Performance Guarantee (including bank or other third-party
guarantees, letters of credit or insurance) or taking such other actions as
Purchaser and such beneficiary may mutually agree on.

 



-51-   Purchaser shall not take any action to cause any Seller Performance
Guarantees (and, so long as any Seller Performance Guarantee remains in
effect, obligations thereunder) to be renewed, extended, expanded or amended
after the Closing. If any Seller Performance Guarantees are not terminated as
of the Closing (the " _Continuing Seller Performance Guarantees_ "), Purchaser
shall (a) use its reasonable best efforts to procure that the Continuing
Seller Performance Guarantees be terminated as promptly as practicable after
the Closing on terms reasonably acceptable to the parties to this Agreement,
(b) defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against and
from, and reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for any losses incurred to the
extent relating to or arising under the Continuing Seller Performance
Guarantees following the Closing and (c) procure that such documents, as are
reasonably requested by Seller or its Affiliates, be executed by Purchaser to
further evidence the obligations set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this
_Section 7.16_.

 

7.17 _Intellectual Property_. (a) Except as specifically provided in this
_Section 7.17_, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that none of Purchaser or
its Affiliates is purchasing, acquiring, receiving a license to or otherwise
obtaining any right, title or interest in, to or under any Intellectual
Property Rights owned or licensed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries), including in or to the
Seller Trademarks.

(b) At the Closing, Seller and the Companies will enter, or will cause their
respective Affiliates to enter as applicable, into a transitional trademark
license agreement (the " _Transitional Trademark License Agreement_ ") having
the following terms:

(i) Seller, or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall grant to the Companies and
the Transferred Subsidiaries a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, royalty-free license for the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to continue using the Seller Trademarks in substantially the same
manner that the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries used the Seller
Trademarks immediately prior to Closing for a period up to one hundred eighty
(180) days following the Closing (the " _Transition Period_ "). Purchaser
shall cause the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries to cease all use
of the Seller Trademarks upon the expiration of the Transition Period.
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries not to (i) contest the ownership or validity of Sellers rights
in and to the Seller Trademarks and (ii) adopt, use, register or attempt to
register in any jurisdiction any of the Seller Trademarks or instruct others
to do any of the foregoing; and

 

(ii) The Companies, or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall
grant to Seller and its Subsidiaries a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-
transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license for Seller and its
Subsidiaries to continue using the Company Trademarks in substantially the
same manner that Seller and its Subsidiaries used the Company Trademarks
immediately prior to Closing for the Transition Period. Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall cease all use of the Company Trademarks upon the
termination of the Transition Period.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 4.17(j)_, Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable,
and the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall
voluntarily surrender for cancellation prior to the end of the Transition
Period any Combination Trademark.

 



-52-  7.18 _Transition Plan_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, Seller and Purchaser shall, in accordance with mutually acceptable
guidelines and procedures and in all events in accordance with applicable Law
and internal policies: (i) designate certain Persons (including, in the case
of Persons designated by Seller, representatives of the Companies) to serve
as members of one or more (as agreed by Seller and Purchaser) transition teams
with representatives of the other party and cause such Persons to devote a
reasonable amount of time to discussing transition matters, including
periodic meetings to discuss planning and implementation of transition plans,
and (ii) reasonably cooperate with the other party to assist in the
formulation of a transition plan in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement; _provided_
that Seller and its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) shall not be required to disclose to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates any Trade Secrets and any other confidential information owned or
held by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, prior to Closing, the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries); _provided_ _further_ that
implementation of such transition plan shall commence only following the
Closing Date in accordance with the Transition Service Agreement.

7.19 _Return of Excess Reserves_. On the third anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " _Reserve Measurement Date_ "), Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, transfer to
Seller an amount (such amount, the " _Excess Reserve Amount_ "), if positive,
in immediately available funds equal to (a) the Reserve Amount, _minus_ (b)
the aggregate of all Losses incurred on or prior to the Reserve Measurement
Date and the amount estimated by Purchaser to be necessary to indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from all Losses relating to an
unresolved claim asserted on or prior to the Closing Date. If the Excess
Reserve Amount is not positive, then Purchaser shall have no obligation to
make any payment, or cause Morgan Keegan to make any payment, to Seller
pursuant to this _Section 7.19_.

7.20 _Liquidity_. (a) Subject to applicable Law, Purchaser and Seller (or one
or more of their respective Affiliates) shall cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to restructure Sellers and Regions Banks existing
facilities to Morgan Keegan and the Purchaser into one or more arms length
credit facilities having a three (3) year term and market-based provisions (as
shall be agreed between the parties and including appropriate collateral and
guarantees, if necessary) in order to provide additional liquidity to
Purchaser and its Affiliates after the Closing; _provided_ that if prior to
the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller (or one or more of Sellers
Affiliates) do not enter into credit facilities providing at least $200
million of liquidity to Purchaser or its Affiliates (including Morgan Keegan),
Purchaser may elect to require that Morgan Keegan pay the Pre-Closing Dividend
in all auction rate securities, Limited Partnership Interests (other than
Non-Transferable Limited Partnership Interests and Limited Partnership
Interests for which consent to transfer has not been obtained as of the date
of the Pre-Closing Dividend and after Sellers use of its reasonable best
efforts to obtain such consent) and Other Investments owned directly by the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the date of the Pre-Closing
Dividend (and not in a fiduciary or similar capacity) and cash for the
remainder (it being understood that Seller can transfer or liquidate any such
securities prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Section 7.25(b)).

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, if requested by Purchaser prior to the Closing,
Purchaser and Seller (or one or more of their respective Affiliates) shall
also cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to enter into one or more
arms length unsecured credit facilities providing additional liquidity of up
to $50 million having market-based provisions (as shall be agreed between the
parties).

 



-53-  7.21 _Supplemental Disclosures_. As of the date no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide to Purchaser (i) an
update to the General Partner Interests Schedule, Limited Partnership Interest
Schedule and Other Investments Schedule to reflect any changes to such
schedules after the date hereof and (ii) an update regarding any Pending
Litigation Matter, Legacy Arbitration or Legacy Proceeding that arises after
the date hereof.

7.22 _Financing; Financing Cooperation_. (a) Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that Closing is not conditioned upon Purchaser obtaining any financing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall not be deemed to be in breach of the covenant set forth in this _Section
7.22_ so long as Seller has acted in good faith to comply with the
cooperation and assistance set forth in this _Section 7.22_. Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, and to cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, and to cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange the
Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the
Financing Commitment Letters (including the "flex" provisions therein) and
shall not permit any amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or
any waiver by Purchaser of any provision or remedy under the Financing
Commitment Letters, if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds of the Financing as
compared to the amount of such aggregate net cash proceeds contemplated by
the Financing Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement or
(ii) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand
any conditions, to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would (1)
prevent, impede or delay the funding of the Financing or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (2) adversely impact the
ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Financing Commitment Letters. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller
copies of any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver to the Financing
Commitment Letters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
except to the extent that Purchaser has completed an offering of debt or
equity securities whose net cash proceeds replace amounts that were to be
provided under the Financing Commitment Letters and which will be available to
Purchaser for Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the commitments under the Financing Commitment Letters
until the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements contemplated by the
Financing Commitment Letters on terms and conditions (including, as
applicable, the "flex" provisions) no less favorable to Purchaser than those
contained in the Financing Commitment Letters, (iii) satisfy (or have waived)
all conditions and covenants in the Financing Commitment Letters that are
within its control at or prior to Closing, and otherwise comply in all
material respects with its obligations under the Financing Commitment Letters
and (iv) except to the extent that Purchaser otherwise has cash resources at
Closing to fund its payment obligations hereunder taking into account upfront
and similar fees payable under the Financing (including to the extent any
"flex" provisions are implemented), upon satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters consummate the Financing at or prior
to Closing. Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing (or replacement thereof) as Seller may
reasonably request, and shall provide Seller with copies of all definitive
documents related to the Financing and, as Seller may reasonably request from
time to time, drafts of such documents posted to a lender syndicate group,
_provided_ that the fee letters may be redacted. Without

 



-54-   limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall give Seller prompt
notice (x) of any material breach or default by any party to any of the
Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of which Purchaser becomes aware, (y) of the receipt of any notice
or other communication, in each case, from any Financing source with respect
to any (1) material breach of any of its obligations under the Financing
Commitment Letters or default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of thereto or (2) material dispute or
disagreements between or among any parties to any of the Financing Commitment
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at Closing and (z) if at any time for any reason Purchaser believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms and conditions and in the manner or from the sources contemplated
by any of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related
to the Financing.

(b) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitment Letters (including the
"flex" provisions), Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources subject to
conditions that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
Purchaser than those set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, in an
amount sufficient when combined with other available cash resources to
consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such event. Purchaser shall
have the right from time to time to substitute other debt or equity financing
for all or any portion of the Financing from the same or alternative
financing sources, _provided_ that any such substitution shall not expand upon
in any material respect the conditions precedent or contingencies to the
funding on the " _Closing Date_ " of the Financing as set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters in effect on the date hereof or reasonably be
expected to cause any delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In such event, the term " _Financing Commitment Letter_
" as used herein shall be deemed to include the new commitment letter entered
into in accordance with this _Section 7.22(b)_. Purchaser shall provide
Seller with a copy of any new financing commitment letters obtained
by Purchaser in connection with any such alternate financing as promptly as
practicable following the execution thereof (other than redacted information
consistent with the information redacted from the Fee Letters).

 

(c) Seller shall provide, and cause each of Company and Transferred Subsidiary
to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to provide, to Purchaser, such cooperation reasonably
requested by Purchaser in connection with the arrangement, syndication
(including marketing efforts in connection therewith) and consummation of the
Financing (as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters) of the
transactions contemplated herein (including any permitted replacement,
amended, modified or alternative financing). Such cooperation shall include:

 

(i) Furnishing Purchaser with such annual and quarterly consolidated financial
statements of the Company and Transferred Subsidiary, information regarding
any Company or Transferred Subsidiary that may be required to assist Purchaser
in the production of pro forma financial statements and business and other
financial data and information of Company and Transferred Subsidiary, in each
case, as would customarily be included in a Rule 144A offering memorandum or
prospectus for an offering of debt or equity securities, as may be reasonably
requested by

 



-55-   Purchaser in order to consummate the Financing, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall not be required to provide information contemplated by
Regulation S-X Rule 3-10 (except to the extent reasonably available),
Regulation S-X Rule 3-16 and Item 402 of Regulation S-K;

(ii) Participating, upon reasonable notice, in meetings, presentations, due
diligence sessions, road shows, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Financing and otherwise cooperating in

its reasonable best efforts to enforce any Non-Solicitation Covenant granted

notifies Seller of activity which it reasonably believes may constitute a
violation of a Non-Solicitation Covenant granted by a third party in any
Contract relating to such third partys potential acquisition of any of the
Companies or Transferred Subsidiaries, Seller shall, within two (2) Business
Days of receipt of such notification, advise Purchaser that (i) Seller will
assume responsibility to reasonably enforce the applicable Non-Solicitation
Covenant in accordance with this _Section 7.27_ or (ii) that there is no

enforce a Non-Solicitation Covenant, it shall promptly take such actions as
are reasonable, customary and appropriate to enforce Non-
Solicitation Covenants including within two (2) Business Days after receipt
of the notification from Purchaser, advising the third party allegedly in
violation of the Non-Solicitation Covenant to cease and desist from such
conduct and, if required to prevent further such violations, seeking a
temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction from a court of
competent jurisdiction. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in
the enforcement of such covenants by, among other things, providing Seller
with such evidence and information as Seller may reasonably require to
document the alleged violations and pursue available remedies. In addition,
Purchaser shall, as may be necessary, cause the appropriate Company
or Transferred Subsidiary to become a party to any civil action seeking to
enforce the Non-Solicitation Covenant. Seller shall keep Purchaser informed as
to material developments in any proceedings to enforce a Non-Solicitation
Covenant pursuant to this _Section 7.27_ and shall not settle any such
actions or claims without Purchasers written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller shall engage counsel
designated by, and mutually agreed upon with, Purchaser to enforce any Non-
Solicitation Covenant pursuant to this _Section 7.27_. Purchaser shall
reimburse Seller for its reasonable costs, including costs of counsel
(including internal counsel), incurred in enforcing a Non-Solicitation
Covenant pursuant to this _Section 7.27_. To the extent that

 



-58-   Sellers right to enforce any Non-Solicitation Covenant granted by a third
party in any Contract relating to such third partys potential acquisition of
any of the Companies or Transferred Subsidiaries is assignable (as it relates
to the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries), Seller shall assign such
right to Purchaser or its designated Affiliate and, following any such
assignment, Seller shall have no further obligations pursuant to this
_Section 7.27_ with respect to such Contract.

7.28 _Cash Sweep Deposits_. (a) Seller shall cause Regions Bank to maintain
that certain Amended and Restated Deposit Account Servicing Agreement between
Regions Bank and Morgan Keegan (the " _Amended and Restated Cash Sweep

the date that all Morgan Keegan customer accounts have been transferred to the

(b) Purchaser shall cause at least $1 billion of cash balance held at its
Affiliates (the " _Purchaser Customer Accounts_ ") to be deposited in
Sellers deposit account servicing program as mutually agreed by the parties
on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the Amended and Restated
Cash Sweep Agreement and in conformance with  _Schedule 7.28_ of Sellers
Disclosure Schedules.

TAX MATTERS

9.1 _Tax Covenants_. (a) _Seller s Liability for Taxes_. Except as accrued
or reserved for in the Companies unaudited consolidated financial statements
(excluding MAM and the Trust Department) as of the Closing Date or as
reflected in the determination of the Tangible Book Value as of the Closing
Date, Seller shall be liable for and indemnify Purchaser for (i) all Taxes
imposed on the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries or for which the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries are otherwise liable (including all
Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated combined or unitary group
of which the 

 



-60-   Companies or Transferred Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of the Companies
or Transferred Subsidiaries) are or were a member on or prior to the Closing
Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local or foreign Law or regulation) for any
taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with
respect to any taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date (the " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date, (ii) all Taxes imposed on the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries in respect of all periods
beginning after the Closing Date, and with respect to any Straddle Period, the
period of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, attributable
to any items of income or gain of a partnership reporting the Companies or
the Transferred Subsidiaries as a partner, to the extent such items are
properly attributable to periods of the partnership ending on or before the
Closing Date, and (iii) all Taxes imposed on the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries resulting from the making of any elections under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable provisions of state, local or non-
United States Tax Law), with the exception of Transfer Taxes (which are dealt
with in  _Section 9.5_). Seller shall include the income of the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries (including any deferred items triggered into
income by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account
taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19) on Sellers
consolidated federal income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing
Date and pay any federal income Taxes attributable to such income. Except as
reflected as a Tax receivable or reduction to Taxes payable after considering
the effect of any reserve for uncertain tax positions in the Companies
unaudited consolidated financial statements (excluding MAM and the Trust
Department) as of the Closing Date or as reflected in the determination of
the Tangible Book Value as of the Closing Date, Seller shall be entitled to
any refund or over accrual of Taxes of the Companies for such periods.

 

(b) _Purchaser s Liability for Taxes_. Purchaser shall be liable for and
indemnify Seller for the Taxes of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date
and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be entitled to any
refund of Taxes of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries received
for such periods.

(c) _Taxes for Short Taxable Year_. For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b),
whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Companies
or the Transferred Subsidiaries for a portion of a taxable year or period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of the Taxes
of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries for the portion of the year
or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after,
the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries had a taxable year or period which ended at the close
of the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall
be apportioned on a time basis.

(d) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due (including
all applicable extensions of the time to pay) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date and shall pay any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns, and Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed
when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (other

respect of such Tax Returns.

 



-61-  (e) Any Tax Return of any of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries
which is to be prepared by one party but which (i) could reasonably be
expected to result in an indemnity obligation of the other party under
_Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.1(b)_ or (ii) relates to a Straddle Period,
shall be provided to the other party for its review, reasonable comment, and
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) at least thirty (30) days
prior to filing. Seller shall pay to Purchaser the Taxes for which Seller is
liable pursuant to  _Section 9.1(a)_ but which are payable with Tax Returns
to be filed by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_. All such payments
described in the preceding sentence shall be made within ten (10) days prior
to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns except as otherwise
provided by _ARTICLE 9_. Purchaser shall pay to Seller the refund or over
accrual of Taxes for which Purchaser is liable pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_
within ten (10) days of receipt of any such refund from or within ten (10)
days of paying the Tax with such Tax Returns to, in the case of an over
accrual, the relevant Tax Authority. In the event payments are due under this
provision which relate to an uncertain tax position, payment would not be due
until the statutes of limitation have lapsed or settlement with the relevant
Tax Authority.

(f) Seller, Purchaser, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall
treat any and all payments under this _ARTICLE 9_ and _Section 10.2_ as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless they are required to
treat such payments otherwise by applicable Law.

9.2 _Contest Provisions_. (a) Purchaser shall not be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for
Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ or which

the Transferred Subsidiaries for any period, or a portion thereof, prior to
the Closing Date to any extent without the prior written consent of Seller,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Seller at its expense shall
have the right to observe and comment on the submissions in an audit or
proceeding relating to such claim. Seller shall have the sole right to
represent the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries interests in any
tax audit or administrative or court proceeding and to control such an audit
or proceeding and the settlement thereof to the extent such audit or
proceeding relates to the Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to 
_Section 9.1(a)_ and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. Seller
shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes for which Purchaser may be
liable pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)_ which would adversely affect the
liability for Taxes of Purchaser or the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries for any period, or a portion thereof, after the Closing Date to
any extent without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

9.3 _Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements_. Any tax allocation or sharing
agreement or arrangement, whether or not written, that may have been entered
into by Seller or any of its Affiliates on the one hand, and the Companies or
the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated as to
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and no
payments which are owed by or to the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries pursuant thereto shall be made thereunder. After the Closing
Date, neither the Companies nor the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, nor Seller and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall have any further
rights or liabilities thereunder with respect to the other party or parties.

 



-62-  9.4 _Cooperation_. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and Representatives to cooperate in good faith, in connection with
(i) the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns relating to the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries, (ii) the determination of Seller, Purchaser
or their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, of any liability for any
Taxes relating to the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries, (iii) any
audit, dispute or other examination or assessment by any Tax Authority with
respect to such Taxes, (iv) any judicial or administrative proceeding relating
to liability for such Taxes, (v) Purchasers determination whether to make
elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable provisions
of state, local or non-United States Tax law), and (vi) elections under

Limited Partnership Interests. Purchaser and Seller agree to retain or cause
to be retained all books and records with respect to Taxes relating to the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries until the applicable period for
assessment under applicable Law (giving effect to all extensions or waivers)
has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention
agreements entered into with any Tax Authority. Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings
involving the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries for any Tax purposes
and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents
as are necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section 9.4_. With respect
to the taxable year of Seller that includes the Closing Date and the prior
taxable year, Purchaser shall promptly cause the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to prepare and provide to Seller a package of tax information
materials (the " _Tax Package_ "), which shall be completed in accordance
with past practice including past practice as to providing the information,
schedules and work papers and as to the method of computation of separate
taxable income or other relevant measure of income of the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall cause the Tax Package for the
portion of the taxable period ending on the Closing Date to be delivered to
Seller within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date.

9.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All excise, sales, use, value added, transfer (including
real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and
other similar taxes, together with any interest, additions or penalties with
respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties,
resulting directly from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
" _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and
fifty percent (50%) by Seller. Notwithstanding _Section 9.1(f)_, which shall
not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns that
must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed
when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable
Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party shall provide such Tax
Returns to the other party at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date
such Tax Returns are due to be filed. If either party is liable under Law for
payment of such Transfer Taxes, the other party shall pay the amount of its
portion of such Transfer Tax no later than seven (7) Business Days after
receipt of a request for payment from the paying party. Purchaser and Seller
shall cooperate in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax
Returns. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or
eliminate such Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

9.6 _Treasury Regulation Elections_. Seller shall, to the extent necessary to
prevent the application of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d) to reduce
the Tax attributes of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries, at the
time and in the manner provided at Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36(e)(5), make the election described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce Sellers basis in 

 



-63-   the stock of the Companies. Seller and Purchaser agree that no election
shall be made under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or (iii)
in connection with determining the allocation of the items of the Companies
and Transferred Subsidiaries between the taxable period that ends on the date
of the Closing Date and the taxable period that begins after the Closing Date.

 

9.7 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. (a) At the request and direction of
Purchaser, Seller shall make joint elections with Purchaser and file
elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable provisions
of state, local or non-United States Tax law) with respect to the purchase of
the Companies and Transferred Subsidiaries and, at Closing, the parties shall
execute a Form 8023 (or successor form), with all attachments, with respect to
each such purchase. The parties shall cooperate with each other to take all
actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional
forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required)
to effect and preserve each timely election in accordance with the provisions
of Treasury Regulation § 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of
state, local or non-United States Tax law) or any successor provisions. In
connection with each such election, Seller shall prepare a draft Form 8883 (or
successor form) and provide such draft Form 8883 to Purchaser no later than
ninety (90) days prior to the due date of such Form 8883. If, within thirty
(30) days after the receipt of the draft Form 8883, Purchaser notifies Seller
in writing that Purchaser disagrees with the draft Form 8883, then the parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement within the twenty
(20) days following Purchasers notification to Seller of such disagreement.
If Purchaser does not so notify Seller within thirty (30) days of receipt of
the draft Form 8883, or upon resolution of the disputed items by the parties
the draft Form 8883 shall become the " _Final Form 8883_ ". If the parties are
unable to resolve their disagreement within the twenty (20) days following any
such notification by Purchaser, then the parties shall submit all such
disputed items for resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose
decision shall be final and binding upon all persons involved and whose fees
and expenses shall be borne equally by the parties. The Form 8883 delivered
by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be the "Final Form 8883". The parties
shall act in good faith to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to deliver
the Final Form 8883 within twenty (20) days after such submission. Other than
to the extent Purchasers purchase price, as determined for federal income tax
purposes, differs from the amount shown on the Final Form 8883, the parties
shall (i) be bound by each such Final Form 8883 for purposes of determining
any Taxes and (ii) prepare and file their Tax Returns on a basis consistent
with each such Final Form 8883. The Purchase Price allocation pursuant to the
Final Form 8883 shall be appropriately adjusted if and when any purchase
price adjustments are made pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ of this Agreement.
No later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date such Form 8883 and any
related documentation are required to be filed under the applicable laws,
Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser the Final Form 8883.

(b) If, at the request of Purchaser, Seller makes joint elections
with Purchaser and files elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
any comparable provisions of state, local or non-United States Tax law) with
respect to the purchase of the Companies and Transferred Subsidiaries,
Purchaser and Seller (i) shall report the acquisition of the Companies and
Transferred Subsidiaries by Purchaser in a manner consistent with the making
of the Section 338(h)(10) election and (ii) shall not take a position in any
Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) election. Seller
shall be responsible for and shall pay any income, franchise or similar Taxes
arising as a result of any election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
any comparable provisions of state, local or non-United States Tax law).

 



-64-  9.8 _Coordination_. Any claim for indemnification with respect to Taxes,
including claims for indemnification with respect to any breach of any
representation or covenant with respect to or arising from, Taxes under this
Agreement, shall be governed by _ARTICLE 10_.

 

9.9 _Tax Information_. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, as soon as
practicable, the following information as per December 31, 2010 and December
31, 2011, as determined to the best knowledge of Seller using reasonable good

carryovers, excess loss accounts in their group, material tax elections in
effect by any member of the Group that directly affect the taxation or Tax
liabilities of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries, and deferred
intercompany transactions involving the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries, any net operating losses or other tax attributes of the

limitation under Sections 382, 383, or 384 of the Code or the federal
consolidated return regulations.

the representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement (in
all cases without giving effect to any materiality, Company Material Adverse
Effect, Knowledge or similar qualifications thereto), (ii) all Losses,
actually incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them may
become subject arising out of or relating to any breach of any covenant
or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement (Losses arising out of or
relating to clause (i) or (ii), collectively, the " _Breach Losses_ "), (iii)
all Legacy Arbitration Losses, (iv) all Legacy Proceedings Losses, (v) all
Pending Litigation Losses, and (vi) all Post-Closing Litigation Losses.

 



-65-  (b) Subject to the limitations contained in this _ARTICLE 10_ , Purchaser
agrees to indemnify Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") for, and
to hold each of them harmless from, all Losses actually incurred or sustained
by any of them or to which any of them may become subject resulting from or

breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement
and (iii) the conduct of the business by the Companies and the Transferred

10.3 _Claims for Indemnification_. (a) _Notice of Claim_. Any Person who is
claiming indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.2_ (the "
_Indemnified Person_ ") shall deliver a written notification to the Person to
provide indemnification under this Agreement (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ")
as follows:

(i) Any Indemnified Person who is claiming indemnification (i) relating to a
Breach Loss pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ or (ii) pursuant to _Section
10.2(b)_ shall deliver a written notification to the Indemnified Person of
each such claim for indemnification no later than ten (10) Business Days
after such claim becomes known to the Indemnified Person, specifying the facts
known to such Indemnified Person constituting the basis for, and the amount
(if known) of (including the basis of calculation of such amount), the claim
asserted (a " _Claim Notice_ "). Such written notice shall be accompanied by a
copy of all papers served, if any, and any memoranda, recordings or other
records of the Indemnified Person relating to the claim; and

 

(ii) If Seller or Purchaser or any or their Affiliates become aware of any new
Action which may result in Losses indemnifiable hereunder as Legacy
Arbitration Losses, Legacy Proceedings Losses, Pending Litigation Losses or
Post-Closing Litigation Losses, then such Person shall promptly notify the
Litigation Coordinators identified in the Litigation Cooperation Agreement.

Failure of the Indemnified Person to give any such notice or to give any such
notice in such form required herein or required under the Litigation
Cooperation Agreement, as the case may be, shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Person from its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Person is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) _Defense of Third-Party Claims Relating to Post-Closing Litigation
Matters_. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) shall have authority to, and
shall use best efforts to, defend any Third-Party Claim relating to any Post-
Closing Litigation Matters) pursuant to the terms of the Litigation
Cooperation Agreement. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) shall use best
efforts to utilize their in-house counsel to defend such Third-Party Claims,
including defending such claims in arbitration hearings. In accordance with
the Litigation Cooperation Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) shall
not settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such Third-Party
Claims, without Sellers prior written consent.

 



-66-  (c) _Defense of Third-Party Claims Relating to Pending Litigation Matters and
Legacy Arbitrations_. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) shall have authority
to defend any Third-Party Claim relating to or arising from any Pending
Litigation Matters or Legacy Arbitrations pursuant to the terms of the
Litigation Cooperation Agreement. In accordance with the Litigation
Cooperation Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) shall not settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such Third-Party Claims,
without Sellers prior written consent.

(d) _Defense and Settlement of Legacy Proceedings_. Seller shall be
responsible for defending any Third-Party Claim related to or arising from the
Legacy Proceedings and shall have authority to defend, settle or otherwise
resolve such Third Party Claims pursuant to the terms of the Litigation
Cooperation Agreement. In accordance with the Litigation Cooperation
Agreement, Seller shall not settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any such Third Party Claims, without the prior written consent or
each applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such prior written consent shall be required to any proposed settlement that
involves only the payment of money by Seller, includes as an unconditional
term thereof the granting by the person asserting such claim or bringing such
action of an unconditional release from liability as to such Purchaser
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim and does not include any
admission of culpability.

10.4 _Indemnification Limitations_. (a) _Indemnification of Purchaser_.

(i) __Breach Losses__. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary: (1) Seller shall not be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
for Breach Losses until the aggregate amount of Breach Losses (excluding any
De Minimis Losses), exceeds $9,000,000, after which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to receive the amount of any such Losses in excess
of $9,000,000; (2) the aggregate amount of Breach Losses for which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive any payment from
Seller shall not exceed the Indemnity Cap; and (3) no payment for any Breach
Losses shall be made on account of De Minimis Losses; _provided_ that under
each of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this _Section 10.4(a)(i)_, the amount of
any Breach Loss shall be calculated in accordance with _Section 10.4(d)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims for breach with respect to _Section
4.1_, _Section 4.2(a)_, _Section 4.4(a)_, _Section 4.16_ or any
of Sellers covenants or obligations regarding Taxes set forth in this
Agreement shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in the foregoing
sentence.

(ii) __Post-Closing Litigation Losses_. _Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall not be liable to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for Post-Closing Litigation Losses incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties during the first three years following the
Closing Date until the aggregate amount of Post-Closing Litigation Losses
incurred in each successive twelve (12) month period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date exceeds
$2,000,000, after which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
receive the amount of all such Losses incurred in excess of $2,000,000;
_provided_ that under this _Section 10.4(a)(ii)_, the amount of any Post-
Closing Litigation Loss shall be calculated in accordance with _Section _
_10.4(d)_ ;

 



-67-   and _provided_ further that such Losses shall not be subject to any
indemnity cap. To the extent any Action involves both (1) Post-Closing
Litigation Losses and (2) Losses attributable to facts, circumstances,
matters, or events occurring after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller
shall equitably allocate liability for Losses between them based on Losses
attributable to facts, circumstances, matters, or events occurring prior to
the Closing Date (for which Seller shall be liable to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties) and Losses attributable to facts, circumstances, matters,
or events occurring after the Closing Date (for which Seller shall not be
liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties). If Purchaser and Seller cannot
agree on an equitable allocation of liability for Losses described in the
immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly engage the
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute in accordance with the
standards set forth in this _Section 10.4(a)(ii)_. Seller and Purchaser shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render
a written decision resolving the matters submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days of such submission. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall address only those items in dispute. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall determine, on such basis, the disputed equitable
allocation of liability for Losses. The written decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on all parties hereto. The fees of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the parties in
relative proportion to change in such equitable allocation from that
calculated by each respective party.

(iii)  _ _Pending Litigation Losses, Legacy Arbitration Losses and Legacy
Proceedings Losses__. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller shall be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for all
Pending Litigation Losses, Legacy Arbitration Losses or Legacy Proceeding
Losses and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive the
entire amount of any such Losses; _provided_ that under this _Section
10.4(a)(iii)_, the amount of any Pending Litigation Losses, Legacy
Arbitration Losses or Legacy Proceedings Losses shall be calculated in
accordance with _Section 10.4(d)_; and _provided_ further that such Losses
shall not be subject to any indemnity cap. To the extent any Action involves
both (1) Post-Closing Litigation Losses and (2) Pending Litigation Losses,
Legacy Arbitration Losses or Legacy Proceedings Losses, that portion of the
Losses which relates to Post-Closing Litigation Losses shall be indemnified
under _Section 10.4(a)(ii)_ and the balance shall be indemnified under
_Section 10.4(a)(iii)_. Allocation of Losses shall be proportionate to the
relative proportion of damages allegedly arising from each category of claim.

(b) _Indemnification of Seller_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary: (i) Purchaser shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified
Parties under _Section 10.2(b)_ until the aggregate amount of Losses,
excluding any De Minimis Losses (as calculated in accordance with this 
_Section 10.4(b)_), with respect to such matters exceeds $9,000,000, after
which the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive the amount
of any such Losses in excess of $9,000,000; (ii) the aggregate amount of
Losses under _Section 10.2(b)_ for which the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to receive any payment from Purchaser shall not exceed the
Indemnity Cap; and (iii) no payment for any Loss under  _Section 10.2(b)_
shall be made on account of De Minimis Losses; _provided_ that in each case
(i), (ii) and (iii), the amount of any Loss shall be calculated in
accordance 

 



-68-   with _Section 10.4(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims for breach
with respect to _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in the foregoing sentence.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Person
shall be liable under this _ARTICLE 10_ for any consequential, punitive,
special, incidental or indirect damages, including lost profits, except to the
extent awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or as part of a final,
non-appealable and binding determination rendered by an arbitration panel in
each case in connection with a Third-Party Claim.

(d) The amount of any Losses sustained by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
or the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be reduced by (i) any amount received
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the
case may be, with respect to such Losses under any insurance coverage (net of
any reasonable costs in connection with such recovery) or from any other party
alleged to be responsible therefor (it being understood that nothing in this
_Section 10.4(d)_ shall require any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any
Seller Indemnified Party to pursue any Action against any such other party
alleged to be responsible), (ii) any net Tax benefit actually realized by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case
may be, with respect to such Losses through a reduction in Taxes otherwise due
(including the utilization of a Tax loss or Tax credit carried forward), and
(iii) in the case of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the Reserve Amount.
The amount of any Losses sustained by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be increased by the amount of any Tax imposed
on the receipt of any indemnity payment with respect to any such Losses. 

(e) Subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE 10_ and the Litigation
Cooperation Agreement, each Indemnified Person shall act in good faith, and
will make the same decisions in the use of personnel and the incurring of
expenses as it would make if it were engaged and acting entirely at its own
cost and for its own account regarding the conduct of any proceedings or the
taking of any action for which indemnification may be sought.

(f) Upon making any indemnification payment, the Indemnifying Person will, to
the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
Person against any third party in respect of the Loss to which the payment
relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that until the Indemnified Person recovers
full payment for such Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Person
against any such third party on account of said payment are hereby made
expressly subordinated and subjected in right of payment to the
Indemnified Persons rights against such third party. Without limiting the
generality of any other provision of this Agreement, each such Indemnified
Person and Indemnifying Person will duly execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation
and subordination rights.

(g) If an Indemnified Person recovers an amount from a third party or
actually realizes any net Tax benefit (including the utilization of a Tax loss
or Tax credit carried forward), in each case, in respect of any Loss that is
the subject of indemnification under this Agreement after all or a portion of
such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Person pursuant to this _ARTICLE
10_ , the Indemnified Person shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Person
the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Person
in respect of such Loss, _plus_ the amount received from third parties in
respect thereof, _plus_ the amount of any net Tax benefit (including the
utilization of a Tax loss or Tax credit carried forward) actually realized in
respect thereof,  _minus_ (ii) the amount of the Loss.

 



-69-  10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud, or as otherwise provided
in this Agreement (including in _Section 7.15_ and _Section 7.16_), the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that should the Closing occur, the
indemnities provided for in this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified
Parties for any Losses sustained, incurred or suffered relating to or arising
out of this Agreement. Any action for fraud shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in  _Section 10.4_.

10.6 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Person shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this  _ARTICLE 10_ , by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Person of a bill,
together with all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for
a Loss that is the subject of indemnification under this Agreement, unless
the Indemnifying Person in good faith disputes the Loss within twenty (20)
Business Days after receiving a Claim Notice relating to such Loss, in which
event it shall so notify the Indemnified Person within such twenty (20)
Business Day period. In any event, the Indemnifying Person shall pay to the
Indemnified Person, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amount of any Loss for which the Indemnifying Person is liable under this
Agreement no later than three (3) Business Days following any Final
Determination of any dispute with respect to such Loss finding the
Indemnifying Persons liability therefor.

Closing:

(a) By mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

(b) By Purchaser or Seller upon written notice to the other party if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date, unless the

material breach by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such party
under this Agreement;

 

(c) By Purchaser or Seller upon written notice to the other party if (i) any
Governmental Authority that must grant a Required Governmental Approval has

(ii) any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, ruling, judgment, order,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority is in effect (which, as
applicable, is final and non-appealable) that permanently prohibits or
prevents the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, unless, in
either case, such denial of approval or issuance of such executive order,
ruling, judgment, order, injunction or decree arises out of, or results from,
a material breach by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such party
under this Agreement; 

(d) By Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller, if Seller has breached its
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations under this
Agreement

 



-70-   and such breach, individually or in the aggregate, would result in the

been or cannot be cured within thirty (30) days following written
notification thereof or, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside
Date; _provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant

agreements or obligations under this Agreement; or

(e) By Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser has breached its
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations under this
Agreement and such breach, individually or in the aggregate, would result in

been or cannot be cured within thirty (30) days following written notification
thereof or, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) the provisions of this
_Section 11.2_, _Section 7.13_ and _ARTICLE 12_ shall survive such
termination and (ii) nothing in this Agreement will relieve any party from
liability for any pre-termination breach by such party of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
11.2_, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

12.5 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by Seller and Purchaser, or in the case of a waiver,
by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay
by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies in this Agreement
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law except as otherwise specifically provided in _ARTICLE 10_. 

12.6 _Binding Effect; Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This

Directors and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted
assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portion of
such provision and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be
affected thereby. If any provisions of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any person or entity or any circumstance, is found by a court
or other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or

intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this

 



-73-   Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons, entities
or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability, of such provision or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
12.7_, the severability of provisions in  _Section 7.7_ (non-solicit) shall
be governed exclusively by _Section 7.7_.

IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE
OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF, OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN (INCLUDING ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN
EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE). NO PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM, OR
ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES (INCLUDING
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE, WHETHER
IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE). NO PARTY
WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION, IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS
BEEN WAIVED, WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT
BEEN WAIVED. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY THE
PARTIES HERETO, AND THESE PROVISIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO EXCEPTIONS. NO
PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES. EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.10_.

12.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that: (a) monetary damages could not adequately compensate any party hereto
in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any other party, which results
in the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated by the Outside Date, (b) the non-breaching party would suffer
irreparable harm in the event of such a breach with such an effect and (c) the

remedy for the enforcement of this Agreement. The parties agree not to seek,
and agree to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY TAX ACT CERTIFICATION

PURSUANT TO SECTION 1445 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE

_Transferors Certification of Non-Foreign Status_

 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a transferee of a U.S.
real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign
person. For U.S. tax purposes (including Section 1445), the owner of a
disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest
under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not
the disregarded entity. To inform Raymond James Financial, Inc. ("
_Transferee_ "), that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition
of a U.S. real property interest by Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), the undersigned hereby certifies the
following on behalf of the Company:

1\. The Company is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign
trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue
Code and Income Tax Regulations);

2\. The Company is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulations
§ 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);

3\. The Companys U.S. employer identification number is: []; and

4\. The Companys office address is:

Regions Financial Corporation

[]

 

[]

 

[]

 

The Company understands that this Certificate may be disclosed to the Internal
Revenue Service by Transferee and that any false statement contained herein
could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this certification
and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct, and
complete, and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on
behalf of the Company.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being a duly authorized officer of the
Company, has executed this Certification as of [].
