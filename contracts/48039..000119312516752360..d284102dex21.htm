Not later than 90 days after the Closing Date, the Vendor will prepare and
deliver the Closing Financial Statements which include the balance sheet and
statement of income and loss and calculation of the Net Working Capital, in
each case as at the Effective Closing Time, to the Purchaser. The

except the Closing Financial Statements will be unaudited and consequently
will not contain notes. In each case the Purchaser will make available to the
Vendor the Books and Records and the services of the officers, employees and
other personnel of the Corporations who participated in the preparation of the
Annual Financial Statements, the Interim Financial Statements and the Net
Working Capital calculation. The Vendor will make available to the Purchaser

preparation of the Closing Financial Statements and the Net Working Capital
calculation, together with such other information relating thereto as the
Purchaser may reasonably request. The Purchaser may notify the Vendor that it
accepts or disputes the Closing Financial Statements and the calculation of

will be deemed to accept them on the 31st day after receipt thereof unless the
Purchaser delivers a written notice (the 

 



\- 22 -  "Dispute Notice") to the Vendor of a dispute (a "Closing Financial
Statements Dispute") prior to that 31st day. On the date of the Purchasers

calculation of Net Working Capital, will be conclusive and binding on the
Purchaser and the Vendor. 



   Section 2.4 | Disputes 
---|--- 

The Dispute Notice must set out the reasons for the Closing
Financial Statements Dispute, the amounts in dispute, and reasonable details

Financial Statements Dispute not resolved by the Purchaser and the Vendor
within that period will be submitted to a senior partner of the accounting
firm of Deloitte and Touche LLP (the "Selected Accountant"), who will resolve
the Closing Financial Statements Dispute acting as an expert, and not an
arbitrator. The resolution of the Closing Financial Statements Dispute will be
final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Vendor, with no right of appeal
or judicial review on any grounds. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Selected Accountant in resolving the Closing Financial Statements Dispute
shall be borne as follows: (a) if the Selected Accountant makes a
determination, in the aggregate, in favour of the Purchaser with respect to
the issues raised in the Dispute Notice, the fees and expenses shall be borne
by the Vendor; and (b) if the Selected Accountant makes a determination, in
the aggregate, in favour of the Vendor with respect to the issues raised in
the Dispute Notice, the fees and expenses shall be borne by the Purchaser. Any
amounts in the Closing Financial Statements not disputed in the Dispute Notice
will be deemed accepted by Purchaser, and Purchaser will not be permitted to
raise any such amounts in connection with the foregoing dispute resolution
procedure, subject to the recognition that amounts not disputed may incur
adjustments in connection with the resolution of amounts included in the
Dispute Notice to the extent they are mathematical functions of or
mathematically dependent on the disputed amounts.

terms of an applicable Contract;

(5) Representations and Warranties of the Vendor: not to do anything that

such Consents prior to Closing and for 180 days following the Closing,
provided that nothing herein shall require the Vendor to make any payment
other than de minimis amounts or amounts which Purchaser agrees to reimburse
or grant any benefit to any Person in respect thereof. Further, the Purchaser
agrees that except with respect to the Required Contract Consents, the
requirement to obtain any other consent, waiver or acknowledgement required
under any Contract shall not be a condition precedent to the Closing, nor
shall the failure to obtain such consent, waiver or acknowledgement result in
any reduction to the Purchase Price payable on Closing or claim by the
Purchaser against the Vendor for indemnification under this Agreement. In
respect of the Contracts listed in Schedule 3.5(8) under the heading
"Indemnifiable Consents", Vendor will be entitled to take any
reasonable actions to mitigate the Damages suffered by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties as a result of the failure to obtain such Consent at or
prior to Closing, including making commercially reasonable alternative

Transaction from one or more counterparties thereto, upon receipt of any such
Consent (which for greater certainty, other than in respect of the Required
Contract Consents, may occur before or after Closing); or (ii) to the extent
such Contract requires the giving of notice to one or more counterparties
thereto, or the passage of time after the giving of such notice, in each case
prior to the effectiveness of the Transaction with respect to such Contract,
Vendor shall promptly give such notice after the date hereof and shall assign
such Contract to PCLI in a timely manner following the receipt of such
Consent, or the giving of such notice or the passage of such time, as
applicable.

 



\- 52 - ---|--- 

During the Interim Period, except as otherwise consented to by the Vendor,
the Purchaser shall:

(1) Insurance: arrange for all replacement insurance coverage for the Business
to be in place effective as of the Effective Closing Time;

(2) Human Resources Agreement: take all steps required to fulfill its
obligations under the Human Resources Agreement; and

(3) Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser: not to do anything that
would cause any of the representations and warranties of the Purchaser under
this Agreement to be false or misleading such that the condition precedent in
Section 6.2(1) is not satisfied at Closing.

 



   Section 5.3 | Regulatory Approvals 
---|--- 

(1) The Purchaser will be responsible for obtaining all of the
Regulatory Approvals, provided, that the Vendor shall be responsible for
making any filing to a Governmental Authority that the Vendor is (or the
Corporations are) required to make under Applicable Law in connection with
satisfying the Regulatory Approvals. 

(2) The Purchaser will make all required filings and pay all requisite filing
fees and applicable Taxes in relation to any filing or application made in
respect of the Regulatory Approvals.

(3) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(4) and Section 6.3, and in furtherance of the
satisfaction of the condition precedent set forth in Section 6.3(1), the
Purchaser will make all reasonable efforts (including agreeing to undertakings
and commitments) to obtain (or cause the obtaining of) the Investment Canada
Act Approval. Except for the Investment Canada Act Approval, notwithstanding
Section 5.3(4) and Section 6.3, the Purchaser will use its best efforts to
satisfy (or cause the satisfaction of) the condition precedent set forth in
Section 6.3(1) and, without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser will take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and will do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the
Transaction as soon as possible (and in any event by no later than the
Outside Date), including by agreeing to sell or hold separate and agreeing to
sell, or taking any other action (including agreeing and consenting to (i)
restrictions on, or impairment of, its ability to own, manage, operate, or
otherwise exercise full ownership rights of, any assets or businesses, or
interests in any assets or businesses, and (ii) creating, terminating or
amending relationships, contractual rights, obligations, ventures or other
arrangements) with respect to, before or after the Closing Date, any assets
or businesses, or interests in any assets or businesses, of the Purchaser, its
Subsidiaries or the Corporations, as applicable (or agreeing to consent to any
such sale or other action, or agreement to sell or take such other action,
including by its Subsidiaries or the Corporations, as applicable and as the
case may be, of or related to any of its assets or businesses).

 

Provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not, in connection with the
obligations imposed by this Section 5.3(3), be required to take any action to
the extent that such action is not conditioned on the consummation of the
Transaction.

(4) If the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives a request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then the Purchaser will make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the Vendor, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request.

 



\- 53 - (5) Subject to Section 5.3(1), Section 5.3(3) and Section 5.3(6), the Parties
will use commercially reasonable efforts and work cooperatively in connection
with obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, including:



     | (a) | cooperating with each other in connection with the filings
required to obtain each Regulatory Approval, and consulting with each other in
relation to each step of the procedure before the relevant
Governmental Authorities and as to the contents of all communications with
such Governmental Authorities. In particular, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law or Governmental Authority, no Party will make any submission,
filing, notification, or communication in relation to the transactions
contemplated hereunder without first providing the other Party with a copy of
such notification in draft form (subject to reasonable redactions or limiting
such draft, or parts thereof, on an outside-counsel-only basis where
appropriate) and giving such other Parties a reasonable opportunity to discuss
its content before it is filed with the relevant Governmental Authorities, and
such first Party will consider in good faith all reasonable comments timely
made by the other Parties in this respect; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | furnishing to the other Parties (on an outside-counsel-only
basis where appropriate) all information within its possession that is
reasonably required for obtaining the Regulatory Approvals; provided, however,
that (i) no such information will be required to be provided by a party if it
determines, acting reasonably, that the provision of such information would
jeopardize any solicitor-client, attorney-client, work product or other legal
privilege or that such information is material and competitively sensitive
(it being understood, however, that the Parties will cooperate in any
reasonable requests that would enable an otherwise required production to
occur without so jeopardizing privilege or jeopardizing the confidentiality
of any such material and competitively sensitive information) and (ii) in any
such case the Parties will cooperate with a view to establishing a mutually
satisfactory procedure for providing such information, and the relevant party
required to provide such information will provide it directly to such
Governmental Authority requiring or requesting such information; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | promptly notifying each other of any communications from or
with any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including promptly providing copies of all
written communications on an outside-counsel-only basis where appropriate)
and ensuring, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and by the relevant
Governmental Authority, that each of the Parties is entitled to attend any
meetings (including telephonic and video meetings) with, or other appearances
before, any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transaction; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | consulting and cooperating with one another in connection
with all analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in
connection with relating to the Regulatory Approvals; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | keeping each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 54 - (6) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(5), in respect of the Investment Canada Act
Approval and the process of obtaining same, the Vendor (i) shall not be
entitled to contact the relevant Governmental Authority or participate in
meetings with the relevant Governmental Authority (whether in person,
telephone or other communications facility), (ii) shall not be entitled to
direct the form or content of any submission, filing, notification or other
communication (which form and content shall be within the discretion of the
Purchaser), (iii) shall not be entitled to receive or review any draft or
final undertakings or commitments made to the relevant Governmental
Authority, other than for the purpose of enforcing this Agreement, and (iv)
shall provide any comments or input on any submission, filing, notification or
other communication as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days, where requested by the Purchaser or by a
Governmental Authority in connection with the Investment Canada Approval,
provided that any comments or input to be provided by Vendor is known to or
reasonably obtainable by the Vendor. For greater certainty, comments provided
by the Vendor need not be accepted by the Purchaser.

 

(7) Reverse Termination Fee.



     | (a) | In the event that the Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.2(c) (Occurrence of Outside Date) due to the fact that the
condition set forth in Section 6.3(1) (Required Regulatory Approvals) is
otherwise not satisfied by the Outside Date, the Purchaser shall pay SIXTY
MILLION DOLLARS ($60,000,000) (the "Reverse Termination Fee") to the Vendor
within two (2) Business Days of the occurrence of such termination. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

The Parties acknowledge and agree that because of the unique nature of the
subject matter hereof, it is difficult or impossible to determine with
precision the actual economic impact as a result of the failure of the
Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.3 or any other
circumstances giving rise to the obligation of the Purchaser to pay to the
Vendor the Reverse Termination Fee. As such, any sums payable under this
Section 5.3(7)(b) shall constitute minimum liquidated damages (whether or not
expressly stated to be so) and have been agreed to as a genuine, fair and
reasonable estimate of the minimum actual damages that will be suffered in
the circumstances giving rise thereto. The Purchaser agrees that the amounts
of such minimum liquidated damages shall be due and payable to the Vendor
regardless of the actual economic impact caused by the circumstances giving
rise to the obligation of the Purchaser to pay to the Vendor the Reverse
Termination Fee. The Parties agree to waive their right to seek a declaration,
judgment or order from a court of competent jurisdiction or other dispute
resolution body that this Section 5.3(7)(b) is unenforceable in accordance
with Applicable Law or should otherwise be altered or amended in any way. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 5.3(7)(b) 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 55 - the right of the Vendor to pursue any claims against the Purchaser it may have
as a result of the failure of the Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under
Section 5.3 or any other circumstances giving rise to the obligation of the
Purchaser to pay to the Vendor the Reverse Termination Fee. 
---|--- 



   Section 5.4 | Access 
---|--- 

From the date hereof until the Effective Closing Time, the Vendor shall
provide the Purchaser with reasonable access during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice to: (i) the offices, properties and Books and Records
(to the extent within the control or reasonable access of the Vendor or the
Corporations) of the Corporations to the extent required to facilitate the
transition of the Business to the Purchaser, and (ii) the personnel of the
Vendor or the Corporations for the purposes of preparing and planning for the
transition of the Corporations and the Business to Purchaser on Closing and
the Purchasers subsequent operation and control thereof; but only to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, and provided that such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Corporations or the
Vendor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not make any written
communications to any of employees of the Corporations (including the
Employees) without first providing Vendor with the form of such
proposed communication and obtaining the prior written consent of Vendor,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Vendor shall not be required to disclose any
information to the Purchaser if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to
(a) jeopardize any solicitor-client or other legal privilege or (b) contravene
any Applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date hereof. None of the Vendor or the Corporations makes any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any)
provided pursuant to this Section 5.4, and the Purchaser may not rely on the
accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as expressly set
forth in the representations and warranties contained in Article 3 of this
Agreement. The information provided pursuant to this Section 5.4 will be held
in strict confidence and will be used solely for the purpose of
evaluating and effecting the transactions contemplated hereby.



   Section 5.5 | Purchaser Pre-Closing Transactions 
---|--- 

(1) Subject to the Vendors approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, upon the written request of the Purchaser, and solely
to the extent that Vendor, in its sole discretion, determines that the actions
described herein would not be prejudicial to the Vendor, having regard,
without limitation, to the taxation, financial and legal implications
thereof, the Vendor shall cause the Corporations to use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) perform such reorganizations of its corporate
structure, capital structure, business, operations and assets or such other
transactions as the Purchaser may reasonably request (each, a "Purchaser Pre-
Closing Transactions"), and (ii) cooperate with the Purchaser and its advisors
in order to facilitate the Purchasers determination of the Purchaser Pre-
Closing Transactions and any transactions or other steps following the Closing
to be undertaken and the manner in which they will be effected. For certainty,
the Purchaser Pre-Closing Transactions will not include any transaction that
is inconsistent with or adverse to the purpose or intent of a Vendor Pre-
Closing Transaction, and neither Vendors action or inaction with respect to
the Purchaser Pre-Closing Transactions will, regardless of whether it results
in a failure by the Vendor to satisfy any of its obligations in this Section
5.5, result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty of Vendor,
or result in any condition of Closing to not be satisfied.

 



\- 56 - (2) The Purchaser agrees that it will be responsible for all costs and
expenses associated with the Purchaser Pre-Closing Transactions to be carried
out at its request and shall indemnify and save harmless the Vendor and the
Corporations from and against any and all Taxes, liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of any such
Purchaser Pre-Closing Transaction, including any of the foregoing that arise
in the event that Closing does not occur.

 



   Section 5.6 | Confidentiality 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement ("Confidentiality Agreement") between the Vendor and HollyFrontier
Refining and Marketing dated June 9, 2016 to the contrary, the Purchaser shall
continue to be bound by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement until the
later of (i) the Closing or (ii) two (2) years from the date of this
Agreement. Upon completion of the Transaction, the Vendor shall hold in strict
confidence and shall not disclose Confidential Information to any Person
other than the Purchaser, any member of the Suncor Group or any of its or
their respective representatives, advisors or agents, and shall not use, and
shall cause any Persons to whom such Confidential Information is disclosed
(other than the Purchaser or its representative, advisors or agents) not to
use, any Confidential Information for any purpose which is competitive with
the Business as conducted by the Corporations and the Purchaser after Closing
for a period of five (5) years.

 



   Section 5.7 | Personal Information Privacy 
---|--- 

The Purchaser shall at all times comply with all Privacy Laws governing the
protection of Personal Information disclosed or otherwise provided to the
Purchaser by the Vendor or the Corporations under this Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser shall only collect, use or disclose such
Personal Information for the purposes of investigating the Corporations and
the Business as contemplated in Section 5.4 and completing the Transaction.
The Purchaser shall safeguard all Personal Information collected from the
Vendor in accordance with applicable Privacy Laws and in a manner consistent
with the degree of sensitivity of the Personal Information and, furthermore,
maintain at all times the security and integrity of the Personal Information.
The Purchaser shall not make any copies of the Personal Information or any
excerpts thereof or in any way re-create the substance or contents of the
Personal Information if Closing does not occur for any reason and shall return
all Personal Information to the Vendor or destroy such Personal Information
at the Vendors request. The Purchaser shall:



     | (a) | promptly after Closing notify all persons whose Personal
Information was disclosed, transferred or otherwise provided to the Purchaser
that the Transaction has occurred and that their Personal Information has
been disclosed to the Purchaser; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | before and after Closing, only use and disclose the Personal
Information for those purposes for which it was collected by the Vendor,
unless in accordance with Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 57 - ---|--- 

(1) Stub Period Tax Returns. The Vendor shall cause to be prepared and
filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns for the Corporations for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period for which Tax Returns are not required to be filed as of
the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and filed on a
timely basis all Tax Returns for the Corporations for any Straddle Period for
which Tax Returns are required to be prepared and filed after the Closing (all
Tax Returns referred to in this sentence collectively being referred to herein
as the "Stub Period Returns"). The Party responsible for the preparation of
an applicable Stub Period Return (the "Preparing Party") shall prepare each
Stub Period Return on a basis consistent with (i) Applicable Laws and (ii) to
the extent consistent with Applicable Laws, the past practices and procedures
of the Corporations. The Preparing Party shall provide to the other Party (the
"Receiving Party") for its review a draft of each Stub Period Return no later
than sixty (60) days in the case of an income Tax Return, and twenty (20)
days in the case of any other Tax Return, prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Return with the appropriate Governmental Authorities. The Receiving
Party shall notify the Preparing Party in writing within thirty (30) days in
the case of an income Tax Return, and ten (10) days in the case of any other
Tax Return, after delivery to it of a Stub Period Return if it has any
comments with respect to items set forth in such Stub Period Return,
including the substance of its comments. To the extent the Preparing Party
agrees with the Receiving Partys comments, then the Tax Returns shall be
filed on a basis that reflects such comments. To the extent the Preparing
Party does not agree with such comments, the Preparing Party shall notify the
Receiving Party in writing no later than two (2) Business Days after receipt
of the Receiving Partys comments specifying the reasons for such
disagreement. The Parties shall then make reasonable efforts forthwith to
resolve any such disagreements, failing which, the Parties agree to cause the
Selected Accountant to resolve such disagreements at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the due date therefor (taking into account any available
extensions), and any such resolution shall be final and binding upon the
Parties. The fees and expenses of the Selected Accountant shall be borne
equally by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each Stub Period
Return where the Purchaser is the Preparing Party, the Purchaser shall, at the
request of the Vendor, cause such return to contain (i) a request to carry
back losses, credits or other available tax attributes that are
solely attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to such earlier taxation
years or periods as are specified by the Vendor in its sole discretion, and/or
(ii) an election by the Corporation pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the ITA
in respect of its taxation year ending immediately before the acquisition of
control of it by the Purchaser. The Purchaser will cause the Corporations to
timely remit any Taxes shown as owing on such Stub Period Returns. Vendor
shall promptly, and in no event later than five (5) days after the
finalization of any Sub Period Return in accordance with provision of this
Section 5.8, pay to Purchaser any Vendor Taxes attributable to any such Stub
Period Return (except to the extent such Taxes were specifically listed and
reflected in the calculation of the Net Working Capital). During the period of
time commencing on the date hereof and ending on the date that is one (1) day
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause PCLI not
to, dissolve, wind-up or be part of any amalgamation or merger.

(2) Cooperation Respecting Tax Matters. Each Party shall provide
reasonable cooperation to the other Party (and following the Closing, the
Purchaser shall cause the Corporations to provide reasonable cooperation to
the Vendor) and their respective counsel in respect of Tax matters arising
under this Agreement, including making available to each other in a timely

 



\- 58 -  fashion such data and other information as may reasonably be required for
the preparation, review and filing of all Tax Returns and in order to contest
any Tax matter, prepare for any audit by a governmental Authority or to
pursue any refund, objection or appeal; and preserving such data and other
information until the expiry of any applicable limitation period under
Applicable Law with respect to such Tax Returns of the Corporations; provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither the Vendor nor any Affiliate of the
Vendor shall have any obligation to provide or make available to any Person
all or any portion of any Tax Return of the Vendor or of any Affiliate of the
Vendor (other than the Corporations).

(3) Tax Notice. If any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties receive any
written proposal to assess or reassess, assessment, reassessment, appeal or
notification of similar proceeding with respect to any Tax in respect of which
a claim may be made for indemnification under this Agreement (each, a "Tax
Notice"), such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall promptly (but in any event
within ten (10) days of receipt) deliver a copy of the Tax Notice to the
Vendor, together with all correspondence relating to, and any other documents
received in respect of, such Tax Notice; provided, however, that failure to
give such Tax Notice on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifier shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(4) Tax Contest Carriage. Where a Tax Notice relates to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, provided that the Vendor has, after receiving written notification of
a Tax Notice, unconditionally acknowledged in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of such Taxes, the
Vendor shall have the exclusive authority to control, at its own expense,
any submissions in respect of such Tax Notice and any objection or appeal in
respect of such Tax Notice (each, a "Tax Contest") and may make all decisions
in connection with such Tax Contest. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Vendor may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings and conferences with any Taxing Authority
with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, contest the Tax Contest
in any permissible manner, provided that neither the Vendor nor the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may settle any Tax Contest without the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided further that the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall only require the Vendors consent to settle that portion of a
Tax Contest that relates to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Taxes for
any other Tax Period for which the Vendor must indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties. If the Vendor fails within sixty (60) days of receipt of
a Tax Notice to assume control of a Tax Contest in accordance with this
Section 5.8(4), then the Vendor shall be deemed to have waived its right to
control the Tax Contest and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the
right to settle and/or dispute the matter as they deem reasonable.

(5) Joint Carriage. The Vendor and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection with
(A) any Tax Contest relating to Taxes for any Straddle Period and (B) any Tax
Contest relating partly to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and partly to other
taxable periods. Neither the Vendor nor any of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall settle any such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of
the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



\- 59 - (6) Tax Refunds. Except as provided below, any refunds or credits of Taxes
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto net of any
Taxes paid by any of the Corporations on such interest) of, or with respect
to, any of the Corporations for any Pre-Closing Tax Period will be for the
account of the Vendor (except to the extent such refunds or credits were
reflected in the calculation of the Net Working Capital). The Purchaser shall
promptly inform the Vendor of any such refunds or credits to which the Vendor
may be entitled hereunder and shall pay to the Vendor an amount equal to the
amount of such refunds or credits within 10 days following the date such
refunds or credits were paid or credited by the relevant Governmental
Authority to any of the Corporations, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Tax refund, credit or other Tax benefit in any Pre-Closing Tax
Period attributable or due to the carryback of net operating loss, tax item,
tax attribute or other Tax benefit from any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be
solely for the account of Purchaser. Any payment made to Vendor pursuant to
this Section 5.8 shall constitute an increase to the Purchase Price.

 

(7) Amendments to Tax Returns. Except as required by Applicable Law or in
accordance with Section 5.8(4), none of the Purchaser or any of
the Corporations shall, or cause or permit their Affiliates to, without the
prior written consent of the Vendor, (a) refile, amend or otherwise modify any
Tax Return of any of the Corporations filed for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period, or (b) make any Tax election that would have any retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Vendor shall have no liability
whatsoever resulting from any action by the Purchaser or any of the
Corporations contrary to this Section.

 

(8) Proration of Taxes. In the case of any Tax that is payable for a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
equal the portion of such Tax that would have been payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on and included the Closing Date. Any payments made prior to the
Closing with respect to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as
though the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date.

(9) Vendor Pre-Closing Transactions. Other than the Vendor Pre-Closing
Transactions, which shall be implemented as described on Schedule 1.1(172),
except in the Ordinary Course of Business, the Vendor shall not undertake any
other similar actions relating to structure, corporate
organization, reorganization, recapitalization, or intercompany account
settlement without the Purchasers consent.



   Section 5.9 | Intercompany Arrangements 
---|--- 

The Vendor shall take such action and execute such documents as may
be necessary so that concurrently with the completion of the Transaction, all
intercompany loans, notes and advances, tax sharing or similar agreements, and
all intercompany receivables and payables, in each case among any of the
Corporations on the one hand and any of the Suncor Group, on the other hand,
shall be settled, discharged or otherwise cancelled, as applicable. In
addition, the Vendor shall, take such actions as may be necessary to terminate
and cancel, concurrently with the completion of the Transaction, all
Contracts between any of the Suncor Group, on the one hand, and any of the
Corporations, on the other hand, other than the Ancillary Agreements.

 



\- 60 - ---|--- 

At PCLIs cost and expense, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Vendor will
cause PCLI to obtain a tail policy for directors and officers liability
insurance, fiduciary liability and employment practices liability insurance
(or insurance policies covering the type of claims covered thereby) effective
as of the Effective Closing Time and covering present and former directors,
officers, employees and fiduciaries of the Corporations with respect to pre-
Closing Date events for a claim period of at least six years from the
Closing Date in amount and scope substantially as favourable to the present
and former directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries as the coverage
applicable to the Corporations directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries
as of the date hereof. The Purchaser agrees not to amend, reduce or terminate
any such insurance policies or the coverage thereunder or to agree to any of
the foregoing.



   Section 5.11 | Access to Books and Records 
---|--- 

For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date or for such longer period
as may be required by Applicable Law, the Purchaser will retain all original
Books and Records relating to the Corporations existing on the Closing Date.
So long as any such Books and Records are retained by the Purchaser pursuant
to this Agreement, the Vendor has the right to inspect and to make copies (at
its own expense) of them at any time upon reasonable request during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice for any proper purpose and without
undue interference to the business operations of the Corporations. The
Purchaser has the right to have its representatives present during any such
inspection.



   Section 5.12 | Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification;
Resignations 
---|--- 

(1) For a period of seven years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
not permit the Corporations to amend, repeal or modify any provision in their
respective constating documents or by-laws relating to exculpation or
indemnification of former officers and directors in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights of former officers and directors in respect of
actions or omissions taken before the Effective Closing Time, it being the
intent of the Parties that the officers and directors of the Corporations
before the Closing shall continue to be entitled to exculpation and
indemnification to the greatest extent permitted under the Applicable Law of
the jurisdiction governing such entity.

 

(2) After the Effective Closing Time, the Purchaser shall cause each of the
Corporations, as applicable, to exculpate (to the greatest extent
permitted by Applicable Law) and indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each of
their directors and officers in office immediately before the Effective
Closing Time against all damages, costs, obligations, expenses and fees
(including reasonable legal fees) to the fullest extent permitted under the
constating documents and by-laws of each such entity in effect as of the date
of this Agreement.

(3) Prior to the Closing Date, Vendor shall secure such resignations from the
officers and directors of the Corporations as Purchaser shall request, such
resignations to be effective as of the Effective Closing Time.

 



\- 61 - ---|--- 

During the Interim Period, each Party will promptly, upon becoming aware,
give written notice to the other Party of the occurrence of any event or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to result in the first-
described Partys conditions to Closing set out in Section 6.1(1) and (2) or
Section 6.2(1) and (2), as applicable, not being satisfied at Closing or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for Damages in favor of any of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Vendor Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Article 7. The provision of such notice will not limit the defaulting Partys
right to remedy such default prior to the Closing Date.



   Section 5.14 | Financial Information 
---|--- 

At Purchasers sole risk, cost and expense (including both internal and
external costs and expenses, and including a reasonable charge for Suncor
Group employee time, as determined by Vendor acting reasonably), Vendor shall
provide audited, consolidated financial statements of the Corporations to
Purchaser as reasonably requested by Purchaser to allow Purchaser and its
Affiliates to comply with any applicable obligations under the _Securities
Act_ of 1933 or the _Securities Exchange Act_ of 1934. If requested by
Purchaser, such financial statements (1) shall be prepared in accordance with
IFRS, as approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), (2)
shall be accompanied with audited reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, and (3) shall
cover any periods required pursuant to Regulation S-X Rules 3-05 and 1-02
(w).



   Section 5.15 | Restrictive Covenants 
---|--- 

Neither the Vendor nor its Affiliates shall, at any time during the five (5)
year period following the Closing, directly or indirectly, engage in, or have
an interest on behalf of themselves or others in any person, firm,
corporation, entity or business that engages in the Business in Canada, the
United States, United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, the European
Union, the Peoples Republic of China, or any jurisdiction in the world in
which the Corporations have conducted the Business in the twelve (12) months
prior to this Agreement. The foregoing shall not prevent the Vendor or its
Affiliates from: (i) acquiring an interest (by share or asset acquisition,
amalgamation or otherwise) in, or otherwise combining with, a non-Affiliate to
the extent the business of that non-Affiliate does not primarily relate to
the business of manufacturing, supplying and selling lubricants, specialty
fluids and greases, (ii) purchasing as a passive investor up to 10% of the
securities of any class of any issuer listed on a recognized stock exchange,
(iii) performing their obligations or otherwise taking any actions provided
for or contemplated in the Ancillary Agreements, (iv) subject to the terms of
the Technology Licence Agreement, engaging in, or having an interest in a
Person that engages in, directly or indirectly, the Intelligro Business, or
(v) engaging in, or having an interest in a Person that engages in, business
with the Suncor Groups wholesale and retail networks in advertising
and selling various products, including lubricants. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of the termination or expiry of the Trademark License
Agreement, after such termination or expiration, Vendor shall not be prevented
from licensing the Intellectual Property that is the subject of the Trademark
License Agreement to an unaffiliated third-party licensee, including for the
purposes of enabling such third-party licensee to engage in the Business.

 



\- 62 - ---|--- 

Within three (3) Business Days following the execution of this Agreement and
within three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date, Vendor shall
deliver to Purchaser an electronic download of the Data Room, which shall
reflect all contents of the Data Room as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date, respectively.



   Section 5.17 | Insurance Matters 
---|--- 

(1) If, after the Closing Date, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
reasonably requires any information regarding claims data, insurance coverage
or other information pertaining to a claim or an occurrence that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim (including any claims under the
Vendors or the Corporations insurance policies relating to periods prior to
the Closing and including any claims made in connection with the matters
described in Section 10.1) in order to give notice to, make filings or claims
with, pursue coverage or proceeds or seek information from property,
casualty, business interruption and other insurance carriers or claims
adjustors or administrators, or to adjust, administer or otherwise manage a
claim, then Vendor shall provide reasonable and timely assistance at the
Purchasers sole cost and expense and shall cause such information to be
supplied to the Purchaser (or its designee), to the extent such information is
in Vendors (or its Affiliates) possession and control or can be reasonably
obtained by Vendor (or its Affiliates) promptly upon a written request
therefor. In furtherance of the foregoing, if any third party requires the
consent of Vendor or any of its Affiliates to the disclosure of claims
data, insurance coverage or information maintained by an insurance company or
other third party in respect of any claim (including any claims under any
Vendor insurance policies relating to periods prior to the Closing), such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(2) Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase an OIL wrap
Commercial Market Property/Business Interruption insurance policy in the
amounts and coverages set forth on Schedule 5.17. To the extent that the
coverage limits are not bound prior to the execution of this Agreement, Vendor
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to bind such additional coverage
upon request by Purchaser at any time prior to Closing. Purchaser shall
reimburse Vendor for the cost of such insurance within ten (10) days of
Vendors payment of such premiums so long as Purchaser has
previously approved the premiums for such insurance. If there is a covered
loss under such Property/Business Interruption insurance prior to Closing and
such loss constitutes a Major Loss that results in the termination of this
Agreement, Vendor shall reimburse Purchaser for all premiums paid by
Purchaser for such insurance.



   Section 5.18 | Guarantee. 
---|--- 

In connection with the Closing, to the extent Vendor has not previously
been released as a result of the Vendor Pre-Closing Transactions, then, if
required for the purposes of obtaining such release, Purchaser will cooperate
with Vendor with respect to the replacement by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates of the guarantee obligations in favor of the Corporations
described on Schedule 1.1(172) and the release of Vendor therefrom. As part of
such cooperation, Purchaser shall deliver to the applicable beneficiary or
counterparty replacement or substitute guarantees, letters of credit, or
evidence of financial capacity, in each case, reasonably acceptable to the

 



\- 63 -  relevant beneficiary or counterparty and in compliance with all applicable
agreements and other instruments to which the Purchaser or the Corporations
are bound. To the extent the Parties are not successful in obtaining the
release of Vendor from such guarantee obligations on or prior to Closing, the
Purchaser shall continue to make diligent efforts to obtain such obligations
and will indemnify Vendor for any payments required to be made by Vendor on
behalf of the Corporations pursuant to any such guarantee obligation.



   Section 5.19 | Intellectual Property Matters 
---|--- 

(1) Within fifteen (15) Business Days following the execution of this
Agreement, Vendor shall take the following actions, and any other actions
reasonably necessary, at its sole cost, to allow for the assignment of the
trademarks set forth on Schedule 5.19 to PCLI:

 

(a) file a request with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office sufficient
to expressly cancel Canadian trademark registration nos. TMA761693, TMA703640
and TMA703641;

(b) file a request (to be approved in advance by Purchaser) with the Canadian
Intellectual Property Office to disassociate the following Canadian trademark
registrations from any and all associated trademark registrations not
otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.19: PETROGLIDE (Canadian Reg. No. 587133)
and PETRO-THERM (Canadian Reg. No. 405214); and

 

(c) file a request with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office sufficient
to expressly cancel the Canadian trademark registration for PETRO-
CANADA PRECISION (Canadian Reg. No. 391117).

In the event that any of the trademarks set forth on Schedule 5.19 cannot be
assigned to PCLI prior to Closing, such trademarks shall be licensed to PCLI
pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement and shall be considered "Licensee
Marks" as that term is defined in the Trademark License Agreement.

 

(2) Vendor shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and
in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, use commercially reasonable efforts to
file with any relevant governmental entity (with priority given to filings in
Canada, the United States, the European Union and the Peoples Republic of
China), at Vendors sole cost, all documents necessary to update record title
to any trademark applications and registrations in the name of Petro-Canada,
but only to the extent such trademark applications and registrations relate in
a material way to the Business or are contemplated to be transferred to the
Business as part of the Vendor Per-Closing Transactions, to reflect the merger
of that entity into Vendor. If such process is not complete prior to Closing,
Vendor shall fully cooperate with Purchaser (including by providing necessary
documentation and powers of attorney) so that Purchaser can complete such
filings and recordations.

ARTICLE 7 SURVIVAL, REMEDIES AND INDEMNIFICATION



   Section 7.1 | Failure to Close 
---|--- 

If the Closing does not occur due to the intentional breach or repudiation of
this Agreement by a Party, or because one of the conditions precedent of a
Party has not been

 



\- 66 -  satisfied or waived as a result of a breach by the other Party of its
representations, warranties or covenants under the Agreement, the non-
breaching or non-repudiating Party will be entitled to pursue all remedies
under Applicable Law, including the payment of Damages (provided that for the
purposes of this Section 7.1, the definition of Damages will be read without
reference to the exclusions therein) and, without limiting the foregoing,
nothing herein will preclude the non-breaching or non-repudiating Party from
seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the
covenants or agreements of the other Party set forth in this Agreement or

agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection
therewith, in accordance with Section 7.2.

 



   Section 7.2 | Equitable Remedies 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will
be entitled to equitable remedies, including specific performance, a
restraining order and interlocutory, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being
waived. All defences to the strict enforcement of this Section 7.2 against a
Party or any of its Affiliates (including that money damages would be an
adequate remedy) are hereby waived.

delivered pursuant to this Agreement to the extent on account of Section

agreement on the part of the Vendor contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | any Vendor Taxes, to the extent such Tax is not specifically
taken into account on the Closing Financial Statements; provided that for
purposes of clarity the gross amount of an item shall be specifically taken

the failure of the Vendor to obtain the Consents listed in Schedule 3.5(8)
under the heading "Indemnifiable Consents" on or prior to Closing, to the
extent actually required to permit the assignment of the contract, and for
greater certainty regardless of whether or not the Vendor has satisfied its

---|---|--- 
 



\- 68 - described in Section 5.1(10), except to the extent caused by Purchasers
failure to fulfill its obligations under Section 5.1(10). 
---|--- 



   Section 7.5 | Indemnity by the Purchaser 
---|--- 

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, and except to the
extent the Vendor is liable for such Damages pursuant to Section 7.4, from and
after the Closing, the Purchaser shall be liable for, and as a separate
covenant, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Vendor Indemnified

the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any certificate executed and

   Section 7.6 | Monetary Limitations 
---|--- 

(1) Without limiting, and subject to, the further limitations set forth
in Section 7.6(2), no claims for indemnification may be made by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties against the Vendor under Section 7.4(b), Section 7.4(c),
Section 7.4(d) and Section 7.4(h) in respect of an individual claim unless
the amount of the Damages with respect to such claim exceeds FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($500,000) (the "De Minimis Amount"). The amount of Damages
with respect to any individual claim that does not exceed the De Minimis
Amount, if applicable, will not be taken into account in determining whether
or not the total of all Damages exceeds the Basket amount under Section
7.6(2).

 

(2) No claims for indemnification may be made by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties against the Vendor under Section 7.4(b), Section 7.4(c) Section
7.4(d) or Section 7.4(h) unless the aggregate accumulated amount of Damages
for claims meeting the requirement in Section 7.6(1) exceeds 0.5% of the
Purchase Price (the "Basket"), in which event the Vendor shall be liable for
the aggregate of those Damages from the first dollar.

(3) The maximum aggregate of Damages which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
may recover from the Vendor pursuant to Section 7.4(a), Section 7.4(e),
Section 7.4(f) and Section 7.4(g) shall be an amount equal to the Purchase
Price.

 



\- 69 - (4) The maximum aggregate of Damages which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
may recover from the Vendor pursuant to Section 7.4(b), Section 7.4(c),
Section 7.4(d), and Section 7.4(h), or pursuant to Section 7.4(e) in respect
of a breach of a covenant that was required to be performed at or prior to
Closing (other than the obligation to close the Transaction after all
conditions to closing set forth in Article 6 have been satisfied or waived),
shall not in the aggregate exceed 10% of the Purchase Price.

 

(5) No claims for indemnification may be made by the Vendor Indemnified
Parties against the Purchaser under Section 7.5(a) unless the
aggregate accumulated amount of Damages for which the Vendor Indemnified
Parties are entitled to be indemnified under Section 7.5(a) exceeds the
Basket, in which event the Purchaser shall be liable for the aggregate Damages
from the first dollar. 

(6) Any claim for Damages by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties made pursuant
to Section 7.4(c) shall not extend to Damages to the extent that those
Damages arise as a consequence of, any action of the Corporations occurring
after the Closing or any action of the Purchaser occurring before or after
Closing.

 

(7) The limitations set forth in Section 7.6(1) through Section 7.6(6) have no
application to amounts payable by the Vendor to a Purchaser Indemnified Party
or from the Purchaser to a Vendor Indemnified Party on account of the failure
by the Vendor or the Purchaser, as applicable to satisfy its obligations under
Section 2.5 and Section 5.12.

 

(8) No claims for indemnification may be made by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties against the Vendor under Section 7.4(i) unless the
aggregate accumulated amount of Damages exceeds ONE MILLION DOLLARS
($1,000,000), in which event the Vendor shall be liable for the aggregate of
those Damages from the first dollar. The maximum aggregate amount of Damages
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may recover from the Vendor pursuant
to Section 7.4(i) shall be an amount equal to TWENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
($25,000,000).



   Section 7.7 | Notice of Claim 
---|--- 

If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any act, omission or state of facts
that may give rise to Damages in respect of which a right of indemnification
is provided for under this Article 7, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
give written notice thereof (a "Notice of Claim") to the Indemnifier;
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding Section
7.11, with respect to claims made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party for
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.4(c), the Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall deliver a Tax Notice to Vendor pursuant to Section 5.8(3) and such
claim shall thereafter be resolved pursuant to the terms of Section 5.8. Such
notice shall specify whether the potential Damages arise as a result of a
claim by a non-Affiliated Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third
Party Claim") or whether the potential Damages do not so arise (a "Direct
Claim"), and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the
extent that the information is available):



     | (a) | the factual basis for the Direct Claim or Third Party Claim,
as the case may be; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the amount of the potential Damages arising therefrom, if
known. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 70 - If, the Indemnifier does not receive notice of a particular claim in time
effectively to contest the determination of any liability susceptible of
being contested or to assert a right to recover an amount under applicable
insurance coverage, then the liability of the Indemnifier to the Indemnified
Party under this Article 7 shall be reduced to the extent that Damages are
incurred by the Indemnifier resulting from the Indemnified Partys failure to
give such notice on a timely basis. Nothing in this Section 7.7 shall be
construed to affect the time within which a Notice of Claim must be delivered
pursuant to Section 7.8(1) in order to permit recovery pursuant to Section 7.4
or Section 7.5 as the case may be.



   Section 7.8 | Time Limits for Notice of Claim 
---|--- 

(1) Notice by the Purchaser. No Damages may be recovered from the Vendor
pursuant to Section 7.4(a) through Section 7.4(i) unless a Notice of Claim is
delivered by the Purchaser on or before the following dates:



     | (a) | with respect to Vendor Fundamental Representations, there is
no outside date for Delivery of a Notice of Claim; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | with respect to the Vendor Environmental Representations, on
or before the last day of the Vendor Environmental Representations Survival
Period; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | with respect to a breach of any other representation or
warranty of the Vendor contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, on or before the last day
of the Representations Survival Period; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | with respect to the Excluded Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities, on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date; 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | with respect to any breach or any non-fulfilment of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Vendor contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in
respect of the Vendor Pre-Closing Transactions, on or before the sixth
anniversary of the Closing Date; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | with respect to any Vendor Taxes, to the extent that such
Tax was not specifically taken into account on the Closing Financial
Statements, on or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the closing of the
applicable statute of limitations (including any extension thereof); provided
that for purposes of clarity the gross amount of an item shall be specifically
taken into account if it is ultimately reflected as a net number due to
financial consolidation.  
---|---|--- 

Unless a Notice of Claim has been given on or before the dates set out above
with respect to each particular representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement, the Vendor shall be released on such date from all obligations in
respect of that particular representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and
from the obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 7.4(a) through Section 7.4(i), as the case may be.

 



\- 71 - (2) Notice by the Vendor. No Damages may be recovered from the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7.5(a) through Section 7.5(d) unless a Notice of Claim is
delivered by the Vendor on or before the following dates:



     | (a) | with respect to Purchaser Fundamental Representations, there
is no outside date for Delivery of a Notice of Claim; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | with respect to a breach of any other representation or
warranty of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any other
agreement, certificate or instrument executed and delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, or in respect of the Purchaser Pre-Closing Transactions, on or
before the last day of the Representations Survival Period; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | with respect to any breach or any non-fulfilment of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement
or in any other agreement, certificate or instrument executed and delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, on or before the sixth anniversary of the Closing
Date. 
---|---|--- 

Unless a Notice of Claim has been given on or before the dates set out above
with respect to each particular representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement, the Purchaser shall be released on such date from all obligations
in respect of that particular representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
and from the obligation to indemnify the Vendor Indemnified Parties in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 7.5(a) through Section 7.5(d) as the case
may be.

 

(3) Waiver of Potential Defence. If the date by which a Notice of Claim must
be given as set out in Section 7.8(1) or Section 7.8(2) in respect of a
particular representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has passed, an
Indemnified Party that might otherwise have been entitled to indemnification
had such date not passed shall not be entitled to assert a right to give a
Notice of Claim on the basis that it did not know and could not reasonably
have known of the existence of the breach of that representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, or of any other element necessary to make a claim for
Damages in respect thereof prior to such date. Each Party irrevocably agrees
not to assert in any proceeding that it should be relieved from any of the
provisions of this Article 7 by reason that it did not know and could not
reasonably have known of the existence of any breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement or of any other element necessary to make a
claim for Damages in respect thereof.



   Section 7.9 | Notice of and the Defence of Third Party Claims 
---|--- 

With respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifier shall have the right to
participate in or, by giving notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party
not later than 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Claim with respect to
such Third Party Claim and subject to the rights of any insurer or other
third party having potential liability therefor, to elect to assume the
defence of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifiers own expense and by the
Indemnifiers own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defence of any Third Party Claim assisted by counsel of its
own choosing. The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifier.

 



\- 72 - ---|--- 

The Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party shall use all reasonable efforts to
make available to the party which is undertaking and controlling the defence
of any Third Party Claim:



     | (a) | those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is
necessary to assist such party in evaluating and in defending any Third Party
Claim; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | all documents, records and other materials in the possession
of such party reasonably required by such party for its use in defending any
Third Party Claim, 
---|---|--- 
 

and shall otherwise co-operate with the party defending such Third Party
Claim.



   Section 7.11 | Settlement of Third Party Claims 
---|--- 

Subject to the proviso in Section 7.7, if an Indemnifier elects to assume the
defence of any Third Party Claim as provided in Section 7.9, the Indemnifier
shall not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defence of such Third Party Claim.
However, if the Indemnified Party bona fide believes on reasonable grounds
that the Indemnifier has failed to take steps to defend diligently such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, at its option and on thirty (30)
days written notice to the Indemnifier, elect to assume the defence of and to
compromise or settle the Third Party Claim assisted by counsel of its own
choosing and the Indemnifier shall, subject to Section 7.6, be liable for all
reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith.
Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, the Indemnifier shall not, while defending such
Third Party Claim, thereafter enter into any compromise or settlement of any
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if the terms of the proposed
settlement involved solely the payment of money by the Indemnifier and such
consent is not obtained for any reason, the liability of the Indemnifier
shall be limited to the proposed settlement amount.



   Section 7.12 | Direct Claims 
---|--- 

With respect to a Direct Claim, the Indemnifier shall have a period of
30 days from receipt of a Notice of Claim in respect thereof within which to
investigate and respond to the Indemnified Party in writing to such Direct
Claim. If the Indemnifier shall object to the indemnification of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Direct Claim, the Indemnifier shall
specify in reasonable particularity the basis for such objection, and the
Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party shall, within 30 days of the Indemnified
Partys receipt of such objection, attempt to agree in good faith upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to such Direct Claim to which
Indemnifier shall have objected. If the Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party
are unable to agree as to indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall be
permitted to submit such disputes to the courts as set forth in Section 11.12.
The Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifier the information
relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate its right to
be indemnified, together with all other information as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnifier. If the Indemnifier does not so respond within
such period, the Indemnifier shall be deemed to have rejected such Direct
Claim, in which event the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to it.

 



\- 73 - ---|--- 

If the amount of Damages incurred by an Indemnified Party at any time
subsequent to the making of an Indemnity Payment is reduced by:



     | (a) | any net Tax benefit actually realized (whether by refund or
by a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable) by the Indemnified Party in the
taxable year in which such Damages were incurred, in any carryback Tax period
prior to the taxable year in which such Damages were incurred, or the single
Tax year immediately following the taxable year in which such Damages were
incurred; provided that Damages shall be increased by any Tax costs, basis
reduction, fees or expenses incurred as a result of the Damages or receipt of
an Indemnity Payment. For purposes of this Section 7.13(a), the amount of any
"Tax benefits actually realized" shall equal the excess, if any, of (i) the
hypothetical Tax liability of the Indemnified Party calculated by excluding
the relevant Tax deductions attributable to such Damages, over (ii) the actual
Tax liability of the Indemnified Party calculated by taking into account the
relevant Tax deductions attributable to such Damages and treating such
deductions as the last items in such calculation; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | any recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to
any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or
payment by or against any other Person, 
---|---|--- 
 

the amount of such reduction (less any costs, expenses (including Taxes) or
premiums incurred in connection therewith) shall promptly be repaid by
the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifier. Upon making a full Indemnity
Payment, the Indemnifier shall, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party in
respect of the Damages to which the Indemnity Payment relates. Until the
Indemnified Party recovers full payment of its Damages, any and all claims of
the Indemnifier against any such third party on account of such Indemnity
Payment shall be postponed and subrogated in right of payment to the
Indemnified Partys rights against such third party. The applicable
Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover from
insurance policies or other applicable sources of recovery the maximum
portion of any Damages of such Indemnified Parties.



   Section 7.14 | Exclusive Remedy 
---|--- 

From and after the Closing, the equitable remedies and the rights
of indemnity set forth in this Article 7 are the sole and exclusive remedy of
each Party and its Indemnified Parties in respect of any misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or breach or non-fulfillment of covenant by the other Party
hereunder, whether occurring before or after Closing. Accordingly, each Party
waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, remedies and claims
that such Party and its Indemnified Parties may have against the other,
whether at law, under any statute or in equity (including claims arising
under any Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation and warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all claims for
breach of duty), or otherwise, directly or indirectly, relating to the
provisions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than the rights of indemnity and equitable remedies as
expressly provided for in this Article 7 and other than those arising from
fraud or wilful misconduct. 

 



\- 74 - ---|--- 

An Indemnifier shall have no liability to an Indemnified Party hereunder:



     | (a) | for any liability which arises solely by reason of a
proposed or actual enactment or change of any applicable Tax Law applicable
after Closing; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | for any liability that arises as a result of any legislation
not in force on the date hereof which takes effect retrospectively; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | in respect of any matter or thing done or omitted to be done
after the date hereof by or at the direction or with the written consent of
the Indemnified Party; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | to the extent that provision or reserve in respect of the
matter giving rise to such liability is made in the Closing Financial
Statements; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | if the claim is based upon a liability which is contingent
only unless and until such contingent liability becomes an actual liability
and is due and payable. 
---|---|--- 
 



   Section 7.16 | Duty to Mitigate. 
---|--- 

The Parties shall have a duty to mitigate any Damages in accordance with
Applicable Law.

ARTICLE 10 TERMINATION



   Section 10.1 | Risk of Loss 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if, prior to Closing,
all or any part of any of the Corporations assets are destroyed or damaged by
fire or any other casualty (a "Casualty") or are appropriated, expropriated or
seized by any Governmental Authority (a "Taking"), but which, (a) in the case
of a Casualty, does not have a cost to repair (including cost of any
remediation necessary to restore the affected assets to their condition prior
to such Casualty) as reasonably determined by Vendor in excess of
$150,000,000, or (b) in the case of a Taking, does not have a Material Adverse
Effect, the representations and warranties of the Vendor that are not true and
correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date solely as a result of
such destruction, damage, appropriation, expropriation or seizure will be
deemed to be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date
for all purposes of this Agreement, and each of such Casualty, in and of
itself, and such appropriation, expropriation or seizure will be deemed to
not constitute a Material Adverse Effect. The Purchaser will complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with a reduction of the Purchase
Price equal to the amount of any applicable then-unpaid deductible amounts
related to insurance covering such event, in which case all proceeds of any
insurance or compensation (including applicable coverage amounts in excess of

the Vendor to any such amounts not used for repair by the Closing Date are
hereby assigned by Vendor and its Affiliates to the Purchaser. Any Casualty
having a cost to repair (including cost of any remediation necessary
to restore the affected assets to their condition prior to such Casualty) as
reasonably determined by Vendor in excess of $150,000,000 and any Taking that
has a Material Adverse Effect shall be referred to in this Agreement as a
"Major Loss". For certainty, nothing contained in this Section 10.1 shall be
construed to require the Vendor or the Corporations to obtain or maintain any
insurance coverages in excess of those contemplated in Section 5.1(2)
and Section 5.17.

 



\- 77 - ---|--- 

This Agreement may be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date as follows
and in no other manner:



     | (a) | by mutual written agreement of the Vendor and the Purchaser; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | by (i) the Purchaser if a condition in Section 6.1 (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing) is
not satisfied or fully waived by the Purchaser at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Outside Date, (ii) the Purchaser if a condition in Section
6.1 that by its nature is intended to be satisfied at the Closing is not
satisfied or fully waived by the Purchaser at Closing, (iii) the Vendor if a
condition in Section 6.2 (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at Closing) is not satisfied or fully waived by the Vendor at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date, (iv) the Vendor if a
condition in Section 6.2 that by its nature is intended to be satisfied at the
Closing is not satisfied or fully waived by the Vendor at the Closing, or (v)
either Party if the condition in Section 6.3(2) or Section 6.3(3) is not
satisfied or fully waived by both Parties at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date; provided that the rights to terminate as provided
for in (i) through (v) above will only be exercisable by the applicable Party
in circumstances where the failure of the applicable condition to be satisfied

by the Vendor if the completion of the Transaction has not occurred on or
before the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days following the date of
this Agreement (as such date may be postponed as set forth below, the "Outside
Date") due to the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.3(1),

(Required Regulatory Approvals) shall not have been satisfied and all other
conditions set forth in Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing) shall have
been satisfied, the Purchaser shall have the right to postpone the Outside
Date (i) by an initial period of up to forty five (45) days by Purchasers

of up to forty five (45) days by Purchasers delivery of the applicable
Extension Notice; it being agreed that (A) five (5) Business Days prior to the

exercised, would occur two hundred and ten (210) days from the date of this

of the Required Regulatory Approvals.

of any other condition, obligation or covenant in whole or in part as provided
in this Agreement.

 

(2) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.2, all obligations

   Section 11.4 | Schedules 
---|--- 

The Schedules have been arranged, for purposes of convenience only,
as separately titled Schedules corresponding to the applicable Sections of
this Agreement. Any information set forth in any Schedule or incorporated in
any Section of this Agreement shall be considered to have been set forth in
each other Schedule solely to the extent the relevance of such information to
such Schedule is reasonably apparent on the face of such Schedule and shall be
deemed to modify the representations and warranties in this Agreement whether
or not such representations and warranties refer to such Schedule to the
extent its relevance to such representations or warranties is apparent on its
face. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed or are within or outside of the Ordinary Course of

the purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained therein shall be
deemed to be an admission by any Party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever. Notwithstanding the use of the terms "material" and "Material
Adverse Effect" in this Agreement, the inclusion of any particular disclosure
in the Schedules shall not, in and of itself, mean that the item or matter so
disclosed is material, represents a material exception, fact or effect, is
required to be disclosed, or constitutes a Material Adverse Effect. Such
disclosure shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the term "material,"
"materially," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
qualification in this Agreement. The Schedules and the information and
disclosures contained in the Schedules are intended only to qualify and limit
the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company contained in
this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or
effect of any of such representations, warranties or covenants. The headings
contained in the Schedules are included for convenience and reference only,
and are not intended to limit the effect of the disclosures contained in the
Schedules or to expand, modify or influence the scope of the information
required to be disclosed in the Schedules or the interpretation of this
Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement or any other Schedule to a Schedule
shall be deemed to include such Schedule as attached to the Disclosure
Certificate, and each Schedule attached to the Disclosure Certificate shall be
deemed to be attached as a Schedule to this Agreement and shall form a part
thereof as though it were attached.



   Section 11.5 | No Disclosure 
---|--- 

(1) Except as expressly provided below, no press release, public statement
or announcement or other public disclosure (a "Public Statement") with
respect to this Agreement or the Transaction may be made by either Party prior

Vendor and the Purchaser.

 



\- 81 - (2) Notwithstanding the forgoing either Party may, without the consent of the
other Party:

     | (b) | make full disclosure of this Agreement and the Transaction
if the same is required by any stock exchange on which any of the securities
of such Party or any of its Affiliates are listed or by any security
commission or other similar regulatory authority having jurisdiction over
such party or any of its Affiliates, and if such disclosure is required, the
Party making the disclosure shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give
prior oral or written Notice to the other Party together with any opportunity
to comment on the proposed form, nature and extent of such disclosure, and if
such prior Notice is not possible, to give such Notice immediately following
the making of such disclosure.  
---|---|--- 

(3) Where the Public Statement is otherwise required by Applicable Law or a
Governmental Authority, the Party required to make the Public Statement will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of the other
Party as to the form, nature and extent of the disclosure.



   Section 11.6 | Brokers

the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing or
other forum. The Parties reserve their right to vary or rescind the rights at

---|--- 

This Agreement is governed by, and is to be construed and interpreted
in accordance with, the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of
Canada applicable in the Province of Ontario.



   Section 11.12 | Submission to Jurisdiction 
---|--- 

Each Party agrees: (i) that any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement may (but need not) be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction
in the Province of Ontario, and for that purpose now irrevocably and
unconditionally attorns and submits to the jurisdiction of such Ontario
court; (ii) that it irrevocably waives any right to, and will not, oppose any
such Ontario action or proceeding on any jurisdictional basis, including forum
non conveniens; and (iii) not to oppose the enforcement against it in any
other jurisdiction of any judgment or order duly obtained from an Ontario
court as contemplated by this Section 11.12. Each of the Vendor and the
Purchaser irrevocably appoints the respective Persons identified in Section
11.9 as its agent to receive on its behalf service of summons and any other
legal process which may be served in any action, suit or proceeding. Such
service may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such process to the
applicable party in care of its agent at the address given in Section 11.9
and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the
respective agents to accept such service on their behalf. If and to the extent
that such service and any summons or other legal process cannot for any
reason be effected upon the applicable agent as in this Agreement provided,
each of the Parties further irrevocably consents to the service of any and all
legal process in any such action, suit or proceeding by the mailing of copies
of such process in the manner specified in Section 11.9. Nothing in this
Section 11.12 shall affect the rights of the Parties to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

 



   Section 11.13 | Entire Agreement 
---|--- 

This Agreement together with the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter and supersede all prior agreements, negotiations,
discussions, undertakings, representations, warranties and understandings,
whether written or oral. There are no representations, warranties, covenants,
conditions or other agreements, express or implied, collateral, statutory or
otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this
Agreement, except as specifically set forth herein and in the Ancillary
Agreements. The Parties are not relying on any other information, discussion
or understanding in entering into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and completing the Transaction.

 



\- 85 - ---|--- 

No amendment, supplement, restatement or termination of any provision of
this Agreement is binding unless it is in writing and signed by each Person
that is a Party to this Agreement at the time of the amendment, supplement,
restatement or termination.



    Section 11.15 | Waiver 
---|--- 

No waiver of any provision of this Agreement is binding unless it is in
writing and signed by all the Parties to this Agreement entitled to grant the
waiver. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right or
remedy, under this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of that right or
remedy. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will be
deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of that provision.



   Section 11.16 | Severability 
---|--- 

If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability of that provision will not affect:

in any other jurisdiction.

or obligations under this Agreement. Purchaser may assign its right or
obligations under this Agreement to a wholly owned Subsidiary of Guarantor
without the consent of Vendor; provided that such Subsidiary has agreed in
writing to be bound by this Agreement and is capable of fulfilling
Purchasers obligations hereunder; provided further that Guarantors
obligations under the Guarantee shall continue in respect of this Agreement
(and such assignment will not be effective until the Vendor has received a
written agreement, in a form and substance satisfactory to the Vendor, which
provides for the continuation of all of the Guarantors obligations under the
Guarantee in respect of the Subsidiary and this Agreement). This Agreement
enures to the benefit of and binds the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. For greater certainty, permitted assigns shall include
successors by amalgamation, and nothing in this Section 11.17 shall prohibit
the Purchaser and/or any Affiliate of the Purchaser from amalgamating with
PCLI at any time following the Closing.



   Section 11.18 | Counterparts and Electronic Transmission 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
when executed and delivered is an original but all of which taken together
constitute one and the same instrument. To evidence its execution of an
original counterpart of this Agreement, a Party may send a copy of its
original signature on the execution page hereof to the other Party by
electronic transmission and such transmission shall constitute delivery of an
executed copy of this Agreement to the receiving Party.
