iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 1, 2012 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among LINDE AG, a stock corporation organized under the
Laws of Germany (" _Parent_ "), LINDE US INC., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned indirect Subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and LINCARE
HOLDINGS INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms used
in this Agreement are used as defined in _Section 8.11_.

 

 _RECITALS_

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof it is proposed that such acquisition be
accomplished by (a) Purchaser commencing a tender offer to purchase all of
the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("
_Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each, a " _Share_ " and,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") for $41.50 per Share (such amount or any
greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any required withholding of Taxes,
net to the seller in cash and without any interest thereon, on the terms and
subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (such cash tender
offer, as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement,
the " _Offer_ "), and (b) following the consummation of the Offer, the merger
of Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
corporation, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), pursuant to which Shares (other than certain
shares as provided in _Section 2.7_) will be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes and
without any interest thereon, on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) approved this Agreement and the Transactions, including the making of the
Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided
for in this Agreement, (ii) determined that each of this Agreement, the
Merger and the Offer is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and the stockholders of the Company upon the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for in this Agreement and (iii) resolved to recommend
that, subject to _Section 5.2_, the stockholders of the Company accept the
Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and, if required by
applicable Law, vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement; and 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Purchaser have each
approved this Agreement and the Transactions, including the making of the
Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided
for in this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Offer_

 

SECTION 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
Article VII, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at the Offer Price
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event
later than July 11, 2012.

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only (x) to the satisfaction
of the condition that at the expiration of the Offer there be validly tendered
in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn that number of
Shares which, when taken together with Shares (if any) then owned by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, represents more than 50% of the Shares then
outstanding determined on a fully-diluted basis (on a "fully-diluted basis"
meaning the number of Shares then issued and outstanding _plus_ all shares of
Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue as of such
date pursuant to options, warrants, convertible securities or similar
obligations then outstanding, other than the Series A Convertible Notes and
the Series B Convertible Notes) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (y) to the
satisfaction (or waiver by Purchaser) of the other conditions set forth in
Annex A hereto (such conditions, together with the Minimum Condition, the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any of
such Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the
Offer Price and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer;
_provided, however,_ that no change may be made without the prior written
consent of the Company which (i) decreases the Offer Price, (ii) changes the
form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum
number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) imposes conditions
to the Offer in addition to the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto, (v)
(A) waives, amends or modifies the Minimum Condition or (B) modifies or
amends any of the other Offer Conditions, in the case of this subclause (B),
in any manner that is or would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the
holders of Shares, (vi) makes other changes in the terms of the Offer that
are in any manner, or would reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse
to the holders of Shares or (vii) except as permitted by this Agreement,
extends the expiration date of the Offer.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the
initial expiration date for the Offer shall be midnight, New York City time,
on the twentieth (20th) business day from and after the date the Offer is
commenced, as determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) (i) extend the Offer beyond any scheduled expiration
date, if, at

 



2  the scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the Offer Conditions (other
than the Minimum Condition) shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permitted
by this Agreement, waived, _subject, however,_ to the parties respective
rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, (ii) extend the
Offer up to an aggregate of two (2) times at the request of the Company beyond
any scheduled expiration date, if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer,
the Minimum Condition shall not be satisfied and (iii) extend the Offer for
any period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or
the NASDAQ Stock Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") that is applicable to the Offer. Each
extension of the Offer pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately preceding
sentence of this  _Section 1.1_ shall not exceed the lesser of five (5)
business days (or such longer period as the Company and Purchaser may agree in
writing in any particular instance) or such fewer number of days that
Purchaser reasonably believes are necessary to cause the Offer Conditions to
be satisfied, and each extension of the Offer pursuant to clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence of this _Section 1.1_ shall be ten (10)
business days (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company and
Parent). Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer
beyond any scheduled expiration date for a period not to exceed five (5)
business days, if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Minimum
Condition shall not be satisfied. In addition, if, at the expiration date of
the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by this Agreement, waived by Purchaser), but the number of
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, when taken
together with Shares, if any, then owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries,
constitutes less than 90% of the Shares then outstanding, without the consent
of the Company (but in consultation with the Company), Purchaser may (subject
to applicable Law) provide for a "subsequent offering period" (as contemplated
by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) for up to ten (10) business days after
Purchasers acceptance for payment of the Shares then tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, in which event Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, (A) give the required notice of such subsequent
offering period and (B) immediately accept for payment and promptly pay for
all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of such expiration date.
Nothing in this _Section 1.1(c)_ shall (i) impose any obligation on Purchaser
to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date or (ii) be deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_.

 

(d) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the satisfaction or earlier
waiver of all the Offer Conditions as of any expiration date of the Offer,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
promptly after it is permitted to do so under applicable Law (but in no
event later than three (3) business days after such expiration date of the
Offer) (the date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ ," and the
time for acceptance for payment on the Acceptance Date, the "
_Acceptance Time_ "). On or prior to the Acceptance Date, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser the funds necessary to pay for
all Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated to pay for pursuant to the
Offer. The Offer Price shall, subject to any required withholding of Taxes,
be net to the seller in cash and without any interest thereon, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Offer.

(e) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together 

 



3  with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_
") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or incorporate by
reference an offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal
and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ").
Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
the holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser
shall cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares and Parent and Purchaser shall consider in good faith any
comments of the Company. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to provide
the Company and its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that
Parent or Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments, to consult with the Company and its counsel prior
to responding to any such comments and to provide the Company with copies of
all such responses, whether written or oral.

SECTION 1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, the
Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which, subject to _Section 5.2_, shall
contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of the Shares as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company, on the one hand,
and each of Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that it shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares,
in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares and the Company shall consider in good faith
any comments of Parent. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent and
its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, to
consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments
and to provide Parent with copies of all such responses, whether written or
oral.

(b) The Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of

 



4  record holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares. The Company
shall furnish Purchaser with such additional information, including updated
listings and computer files of shareholders, mailing labels and security
position listings, and such other assistance as Parent, Purchaser or their
agents may reasonably require in communicating the Offer to the record and
non-objecting beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or
the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information
contained in such labels, listings and files, shall use such information
solely in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_ or if the Offer is otherwise
terminated, shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company
all copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in their
possession or in the possession of their agents or representatives.

 

SECTION 1.3 _Directors of the Company_.

(a) Upon the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and for so long
thereafter as Parent and its Subsidiaries own in the aggregate more than 50%
of the outstanding Shares then outstanding determined on a fully diluted
basis (as described in _Section 1.1(b)_), and subject to compliance with
applicable federal securities Laws and the applicable rules of the NASDAQ,
Parent shall be entitled to designate for appointment or election to
the Company Board, upon written notice to the Company, such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, as is equal to the product
obtained by multiplying the total number of directors on the Company Board
(after giving effect to the directors designated by Parent pursuant to this
sentence) by the percentage that the number of Shares so owned by Parent and
its Subsidiaries bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request
of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly cause Parents
designees (and any replacement designees in the event that any designee shall
no longer be on the Company Board) to be so appointed or elected to the
Company Board and, in furtherance thereof, to the extent necessary, use its
reasonable best efforts to increase the size of the Company Board or obtain
the resignation of such number of the incumbent directors as is necessary to
give effect to the foregoing provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until
the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least three (3) directors
who are (i) directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement and (ii)
Qualified Persons (as defined below) (" _Independent Directors_ ");
_provided, however,_ that if the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below three (3) for any reason whatsoever (or if immediately following
consummation of the Offer there are not at least three (3) then-existing
directors of the Company who are (A) Qualified Persons and (B) willing to
serve as Independent Directors), then, unless the remaining Independent
Director(s) (if any) identifies a Qualified Person willing to serve as an
Independent Director (in which case such remaining Independent Director(s)
shall be entitled to designate such Qualified Person to fill such vacancy and
such designated Qualified Person shall be deemed to be an Independent
Director for purposes of this Agreement), the other directors shall be
required to designate Qualified Persons to fill such vacancies, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. As used herein, a " _Qualified Person_ " means an individual who
(i) is not an officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
qualifies as an "independent director" as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the
NASDAQ Listing Rules and (iii) is eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under applicable Exchange Act and

 



5  NASDAQ rules. The Independent Directors shall have the authority to retain
counsel and financial advisors of their choice at the reasonable expense of
the Company as determined appropriate by the Independent Directors for the
purpose of fulfilling their obligations hereunder and shall have the
authority, following the Acceptance Time, to institute any action on behalf of
the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms. Following the Acceptance Time, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall
take any action to remove any Independent Director absent cause and subject to
the terms of the Company Charter Documents.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under _Section 1.3(a)_, including mailing to the
Companys stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9 if it
receives from Parent and Purchaser the information below on a basis timely to
permit such mailing) as is necessary to fulfill the Companys obligations
under _Section 1.3(a)_. The Companys obligations to appoint Parents
designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ shall be subject
to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder and to Parents compliance with its obligations under
the following sentence. Parent and Purchaser shall supply the Company such
information with respect to Parent and Purchaser and their nominees, officers,
directors and Affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is
necessary in connection with the appointment of any of Parents designees
under _Section 1.3(a)_, and Parent and Purchaser shall be solely responsible
for the accuracy and completeness of such information.

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
_Section 1.3(a)_ and prior to the Effective Time, the approval by
affirmative vote or written consent of all of the Independent Directors then
in office (the " _Independent Director Approval_ ") shall be required to
authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the
Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other committee thereof or any other director of the Company,
shall, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, be required or
permitted to authorize): (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement
by the Company; (ii) any extension by the Company of time for performance of
any obligation or action under this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser; (iii)
any waiver, exercise or enforcement of any of the Companys rights under this
Agreement; (iv) any amendment of the Company Charter Documents; (v) any action
adversely affecting the rights of the Companys stockholders; or (vi) any
other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement. To the extent
permitted under applicable Law, following the time directors designated by
Parent are elected or appointed to the Company Board and prior to the
Effective Time, in addition to any requirements under the Company Charter
Documents, any quorum of the Company Board for the purposes of any meeting
thereof or transacting of business thereby with respect to the approval of any
of the foregoing actions shall be deemed to require the presence of at least
one (1) Independent Director.

 



6 SECTION 1.4 _Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time, if required by
applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through
the Company Board, shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Charter Documents:

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the
Companys stockholders for the purposes of considering and taking action upon
the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "); and 

(ii) in consultation with Parent, prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary
proxy or information statement relating to the Merger and this Agreement and
obtain and furnish the information required by the SEC to be included therein
and, after consultation with Parent, respond promptly to any comments made by
the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy or information statement and
cause a definitive proxy or information statement (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Proxy/Information
Statement_ ") to be mailed to the Companys stockholders at the
earliest practicable date; _provided_ that no amendments or supplements to
the Proxy/Information Statement shall be made by the Company without
consultation with Parent. Parent shall provide the Company with such
information with respect to Parent and its Affiliates as shall be required to
be included in the Proxy/Information Statement.

(b) The Company, on the one hand, and each of Parent and Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Proxy/Information Statement if and to the extent that it shall be or shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
shall cause the Proxy/Information Statement as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case, as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Proxy/Information Statement before it is filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the Companys stockholders and the Company shall consider in good faith
any comments of Parent. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent and
its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy/Information Statement promptly after the receipt of such
comments, to consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any
such comments and to provide Parent with copies of all such responses, whether
written or oral.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section 1.4_, in the event
that Parent, Purchaser and any of Parents other Subsidiaries shall acquire
in the aggregate at least 90% of the outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer
or otherwise, the parties hereto shall, subject to _Article VI_ hereof, take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective
as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 



7 (d) Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares acquired in the
Offer or otherwise then owned by it, Purchaser or any of Parents other
Subsidiaries in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 1.5 _Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy/Information Statement_.
Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, whenever any party
hereto becomes aware of any event or change which is required to be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9
and/or the Proxy/Information Statement, such party shall promptly inform the
other parties thereof and each of the parties shall cooperate in the
preparation, filing with the SEC and (as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws) dissemination to the Companys
stockholders of such amendment or supplement.

SECTION 1.6 _Top-Up Option to Acquire Additional Shares_.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable in accordance with this _Section 1.6_, to
purchase that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute
one (1) share more than the number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary
for Purchaser to be merged into the Company pursuant to Section 253 of the
DGCL (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant
to the exercise of the Top-Up Option) for a cash purchase price per Top-Up
Option Share equal to the Offer Price; _provided, however,_ that in no event
will the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common
Stock in excess of the number of authorized but unissued shares of Company
Common Stock (including as authorized and unissued shares, for purposes of
this  _Section 1.6_, any shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury of
the Company). Subject to _Section 1.6(c)_, the aggregate amount payable to
the Company for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be equal to the product of the
number of Top-Up Option Shares and the Offer Price (the " _Top-Up
Consideration_ ").

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Purchaser once, in whole and not
in part, immediately after the Acceptance Time or the expiration of any
subsequent offering period, as applicable, so long as the exercise of the Top-
Up Option would, after issuance of such Top-Up Option Shares, be sufficient
to allow for Purchaser to be merged into the Company pursuant to Section 253
of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate
upon the earlier of: (i) the fifth (5th) business day after the later of (1)
the Acceptance Date and (2) the expiration of any subsequent offering period;
and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. The
obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise
of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A) no provision of any
applicable Law and no injunction, judgment, ruling, order or decree
instituted, issued or entered which prohibits the exercise of the Top-
Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such
exercise, (B) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the aggregate number of
Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries would be sufficient to allow for
Purchaser to be merged into the Company pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL
and (C) Purchaser has accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the
Offer and not withdrawn.

 



8 (c) The Top-Up Consideration shall consist of (i) an amount equal to the par
value of the Top-Up Option Shares, to be paid in cash, and (ii) an amount
equal to the balance of the Top-Up Consideration, which may be paid in the
sole discretion of Parent and Purchaser (x) in cash or (y) by issuance of a
promissory note (which shall be treated as payment to the extent of the
principal amount thereof) with full recourse to Parent, or any combination of
the foregoing. Any such promissory note shall (A) accrue simple interest at
the rate per annum of 5.0%, (B) shall mature on the first (1st) anniversary
of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note, (C) may be
prepaid at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty, (D)
shall provide that the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest under the
promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in the event that (1)
Purchaser fails to make any payment on the promissory note as provided therein
and such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days or (2) Purchaser
files or has filed against it any petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency
Law or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors and (E) shall
have no other material terms. The Company Board has determined that the Top-
Up Consideration is adequate in accordance with the DGCL and otherwise taken
all steps necessary such that upon issuance and delivery in accordance with
this _Section 1.6_ the Top-Up Option Shares shall be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable.

(d) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall give the Company written notice, and shall set forth in such notice: (i)
the number of Shares that will be owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately
preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares; (ii) the place and time
for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares; (iii) the number
of Shares that Purchaser intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option and
(iv) the manner in which Purchaser intends to pay the applicable
exercise price. Such notice also shall include an undertaking signed by
Parent and Purchaser that Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) as promptly as practicable after such exercise of the Top-Up Option and
the delivery by the Company of the Top-Up Option Shares, consummate the
Merger in accordance with the terms hereof. At the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares, Parent or Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to
the Company the Top-Up Consideration, and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Parent or Purchaser the Top-Up Option Shares in either book-entry
form or evidenced by a certificate (as determined by the Company).

(e) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ is accomplished consistent with
all applicable legal requirements of all Governmental Authorities, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option
Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "). Purchaser
acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares which Purchaser may acquire upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act
and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption for transactions
not involving a public offering. Purchaser represents and warrants to the
Company that Purchaser is, or will be upon any purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under
the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up
Option Shares purchased, if any, are being and will be acquired by Purchaser
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

 



9 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees and acknowledges that in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, the Surviving Corporation
shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any cash
or the promissory note delivered to the Company in payment for such Top-Up
Option Shares should be considered in connection with the determination of the
fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL.

ARTICLE II

 

 _The Merger_

SECTION 2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective

SECTION 2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by
the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which date shall be no later than the
second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.1_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767
Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, unless another time, date or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

SECTION 2.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (or, if
applicable, a certificate of ownership and merger), executed in accordance
with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by
the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 

SECTION 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to _Section
5.7_ hereof).

 



10 SECTION 2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.7 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of Purchaser or the Company:

(a) Each (i) issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Purchaser shall
be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and (ii) Share owned by a Subsidiary of the Company or
a Subsidiary of Parent other than Purchaser, shall be converted into and
become a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation that is
proportionate to such converted Shares percentage of the total equity of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Any Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any Shares
owned by Parent or Purchaser, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease
to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Each issued and outstanding Share (other than (i) Shares to be converted
into common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with _Section
2.7(a)_, (ii) Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.7(b)_ and
(iii) any Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount of cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest, payable to the
holder thereof in the manner provided in this Agreement (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Shares (" _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this Agreement, without interest.

SECTION 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of Shares

 



11  in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms
reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of holders of Shares,
the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_. Parent shall deposit or cause
Purchaser to deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent
at or prior to the Effective Time, to be held by the Paying Agent in trust
for the holders of Shares and the Surviving Corporation. Such aggregate Merger
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement
to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i)
short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
(iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Services or (iv) money
market funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing. Earnings on
the investment of the funds shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment of the funds shall
relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the
payments required by this _Article II_ , and following any net losses from any
such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses, which additional funds
shall be deemed to be part of the funds. No investment of the funds shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, whose shares were converted pursuant to  _Section 2.7_
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and
shall have such other customary provisions (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry
Shares) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any required withholding of
Taxes, for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x)
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as

 



12  contemplated by this _Section 2.8_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_, without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that evidenced ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the
last sentence of  _Section 2.8(e)_, if, at any time after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_. 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares held by such holders, as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



13 (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer or Merger such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Law related to Taxes. To the
extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made. If any withholding obligation may be
avoided by such holder providing information or documentation to Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such information
shall be requested prior to any such withholding.

 

SECTION 2.9 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_
"), pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive such consideration
as may be due such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL unless such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
such payment or appraisal. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Dissenting Shares, except the right to receive the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses any such Appraisal Rights or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, each such share of such holder shall no
longer be considered a Dissenting Share and shall be deemed to have converted
into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7_, without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
written demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company
Common Stock or written threats thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating
to stockholders rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

SECTION 2.10 _Company Equity Awards_. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be
required to effect the following:

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and
the holder of any outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under

 



14  the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (other than rights under the Company
ESPP) (each, an " _Option_ "), each Option, whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be cancelled
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option and (y) the
excess, if any, of the amount of the Offer Price over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Option, with the aggregate
amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount
of such cash payable to holders of all Options, the " _Option Consideration_
"), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law related to Taxes with
respect to the making of such payment. The Company shall pay the holders of
Options the cash payments described in this _Section 2.10(a)_ at or as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, without interest. 

(b) _Restricted Stock_. Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder of
any award of restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock
Plans or otherwise (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") that has not previously
vested, at the Effective Time, each such Restricted Share shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.7_.

(c) _Company ESPP_. As soon as administratively practicable following the
date of this Agreement, but not later than the day immediately prior to the
date on which the first Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) that
is regularly scheduled to commence under the Companys 2009 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall take such actions as are necessary to suspend the Company ESPP
so that no further Offering Periods shall commence after the date of this
Agreement and the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of
the first Offering Date (as defined in the Company ESPP) following the date of
this Agreement and the New Exercise Date, but subsequent to the exercise of
purchase rights pursuant to the penultimate sentence of this _Section
2.10(c)_. With respect to the Offering Period that is in effect under the
Company ESPP on the date of this Agreement, except to the extent necessary to
maintain the status of the Company ESPP as an "employee stock purchase plan"
within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, the Company shall prevent any new participants and any increases
in payroll deductions. If the day immediately prior to the Acceptance Date
(the " _New Exercise Date_ ") occurs prior to the first Offering Date
following the date of this Agreement, each purchase right outstanding on the
New Exercise Date under the Company ESPP shall be automatically exercised by
applying the payroll deductions of each then-current participant in the
Company ESPP for the then-current Offering Period to the purchase of whole
shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the Company ESPP
regarding the maximum number and value of shares purchasable per participant)
at a purchase price per share determined under Section 4 of the Company ESPP
on the New Exercise Date. The Company shall provide at least ten (10) days
prior written notice to each participant in the Company ESPP of such purchase.

(d) The Company shall provide written notice, of the Transactions or
otherwise, to holders of Options and Restricted Shares to the extent required
pursuant to the terms of any applicable stock option agreements, restricted
stock agreements or Company Stock 

 



15  Plan under which such Options and Restricted Shares were awarded. The
Company shall ensure, prior to the Acceptance Time, that following the
Acceptance Time there shall be no rights to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock, Options or any other interests in respect of any capital stock of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries (including any
"phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) outstanding. 

ARTICLE III

_Representations and Warranties of the Company_

Except as disclosed in (i) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") or (ii) the Company SEC Documents publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement, excluding any disclosures that contain
general cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements set forth in any
section of a Company SEC Document entitled "risk factors" or constituting
"forward-looking statements" or any other sections of such filings (it being
understood that any matter disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or in
such Company SEC Documents shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any
section of this _Article III_ to which the matter relates, to the extent the
relevance of such matter to such section is reasonably apparent from the text
of the relevant disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule or in such

first two sentences of this _Section 3.12_.

SECTION 3.13 _Material Contracts_. Except as entered into after the date
hereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, there are no Contracts
that are material to the business, properties, assets, condition (financial
or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, required to be filed as exhibits to the Company SEC
Documents pursuant to Rule 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the
Exchange Act (any such contract, each a " _Company Material Contract_ "). Each
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which
any of them or any of their respective properties or assets are bound is
valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect, except for such
failures to be in full force and effect that would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any
condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would
cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for
violations or defaults that would not reasonably be expected to have a

 



25  Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of (a) all Contracts between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the ten (10) largest customers

good and marketable fee simple title to all Owned Real Property, free and
clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens.

(b) Section 3.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all
material real property leased or subleased by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company (each, a " _Company Real Property Lease_ "). Each Company Real
Property Lease is valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect,
except for such failures to be in full force and effect that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has received written notice of
default under any Company Real Property Lease by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the
giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except for matters that
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (as the case may be) has a valid,
binding and enforceable leasehold estate under all Company Real Property
Leases, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens.

keep any of the Company Intellectual Property Rights set forth in Section
3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in force and (ii) the Company owns
all right, title and

 



26  interest in and to such Company Intellectual Property Rights, free and clear
of all Liens, except Permitted Liens and any licenses granted to any
distributors, resellers, customers, service providers or other Persons in the
ordinary course of business.

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no ongoing interferences,
oppositions, reissues, reexaminations, cancellations, challenges or other
proceedings that are pending in the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
the Canadian Intellectual Property Office or any other Governmental Authority
and that challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the material
registrations and applications included in the Company Intellectual Property
Rights, except for office actions, appeals and similar ex parte proceedings in
the ordinary course. 

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted as of the date of this Agreement
does not infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Right of any
other Person, except for any such infringement or misappropriation that would

any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent) any
information or access with respect to, any Takeover Proposal or (iv)
participate in any discussions regarding any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the immediately preceding clause (iv) shall not prevent the
Company and its Representatives from (A) describing the operation of this
Section 5.2 and (B) engaging in limited discussions solely for the purpose of
clarifying ambiguities in any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the two immediately preceding sentences by any Representative of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_
by the Company, whether or not the Company has used reasonable best efforts to
prevent such violation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time, in the
event that the Company receives a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that
was not solicited after the date of this Agreement by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, the Company and its
Representatives may engage in negotiations or substantive
discussions (including, as a part thereof, making counterproposals) with, or
furnish any information and other access to, any Person making such Takeover
Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of financing if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to result (including after the taking of any
actions referred to in this  _Section 5.2(b)_) in a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that (i) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information, the Company
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms that are not materially less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood and agreed
that such confidentiality

 



34  agreement need not prohibit the making of Takeover Proposals (and related
communications) privately to the Company or the Company Board and shall
contain provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the
provisions of this _Section 5.2_) and (ii) any such nonpublic information so
furnished has been previously provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
substantially concurrently with it being so furnished to such Person or its
Representatives.

modify), the Company Board Recommendation or (B) publicly recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
_Section 5.2(b)_) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company Board may make a Change in
Recommendation if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law or (ii) if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors, that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation with
respect to such Superior Proposal and/or the Company or its Subsidiaries may
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal if, in the case of a Company Acquisition Agreement, the
Company shall have, concurrently with such entry into such Company Acquisition
Agreement, terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (1) no Change in Recommendation and (2)
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ shall be made,
in each case, until after the third (3rd) business day following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to make a Change in Recommendation (a " _Notice of
Adverse Recommendation_ ") or terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, if the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board
is a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Adverse Recommendation or Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
three (3) business day period). In determining whether to make a Change in
Recommendation or in determining whether a Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall take into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of
Adverse Recommendation, a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise.

 



35 (e) The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally or in writing of any
Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making
any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and material details (including any material change to
the terms thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal and any discussions and
negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all material written correspondence relating to any such Takeover
Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Person making a Takeover Proposal, on the other hand. 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or group of Persons relating
to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A)
acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of inventory in the ordinary
course of business) equal to 25% or more of the Companys consolidated assets
or to which 25% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of beneficial ownership
(within the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of
the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Person (or "group," as defined under
Section 13 of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 25% or more of
the outstanding Company Common Stock or (D) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company; in each case, other than the
Transactions.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a Takeover Proposal (provided that for
purposes of this definition, references to "25%" in the definition of
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50.1%") (A) on terms
which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors, to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Companys stockholders than the Transactions
(taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal
and this Agreement, including any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such Takeover Proposal or otherwise) and (B)
that is reasonably capable of being completed, taking in account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal.

(g) Nothing in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if the Company Board
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so
disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law. In
addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement
(including _Article VII_ ), a factually accurate public statement by the
Company concerning financial results, operations or business conditions or
developments or any "stop, look and listen" or similar communication by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act (including
disclosure of the Companys receipt of a Takeover Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto) shall not constitute a Change in
Recommendation.

 



36 SECTION 5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii)
obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Authority necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Transactions. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust
Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other
applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority (in the United States or
any foreign jurisdiction) that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event by July 11, 2012 and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section
5.3_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon
as practicable and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions
and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to
any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law
on the Transactions.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before
a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party
informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any
material communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the

 



37  exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall (1) have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the
others on, all the information relating to the Transactions or the other
parties that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and (2) to the extent allowed by the applicable Governmental
Authority, consult with the other parties hereto in advance of any meeting or
conference with the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or other Governmental Authority relating to the
Transactions and give the other parties hereto the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
_Section 5.3_ shall not be construed to require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of Parent, to undertake any efforts or to take any
action if the taking of such efforts or action would reasonably be expected to
result in a Substantial Detriment; _provided_ , _however_ , that reasonable
best efforts of Parent under this  _Section 5.3_ shall include agreeing to
take actions that would not result in a Substantial Detriment.

 

SECTION 5.4 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent may make an ad hoc announcement as
required by Law or international securities exchange prior to the initial
press release. Prior to making such announcement, Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the Company. Thereafter,
neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing
agreement with any national or international securities exchange or NASDAQ as
determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make
such release (in which case such party shall use its reasonable efforts to
consult in good faith with the other party before such public announcement).
Each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response to
specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as such
statements are substantially similar to previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company (or
individually, if approved by the other party). For the avoidance of doubt,
neither party will be required to obtain any prior consent of, or consult
with, the other party in connection with any such press release or
public announcement if the Company Board has effected any Change in
Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so.

SECTION 5.5  _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford to
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
to the Companys properties, books, Contracts and records and the Company
shall furnish promptly to Parent such other information concerning its
business and properties as Parent may reasonably request (provided that Parent
and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company);
_provided, however_ , that

 



38  the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if
the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would (a)
violate applicable Law, (b) violate a Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third-party, (c) jeopardize the protection of an
attorney-client privilege or (d) expose the Company to risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information; _provided, further_ , that
the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information
regarding the deliberations of the Company Board (or any committee thereof) in
connection with the Transactions or the evaluation of strategic alternatives
or any materials provided to the Company Board (or any committees thereof) in
connection therewith. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will
be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April
15, 2011, between Parent and the Company (as amended by that certain Letter
Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2012, by and between Parent and the Company and
as it may be further amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, use
such information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions.

 

SECTION 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent and (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions.

 

SECTION 5.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director, officer, manager or employee of the Company or
of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively,
the " _Indemnitees_ ") (i) with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding
or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the
fact that an Indemnitee was a director, officer, manager or employee of the
Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the
Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of
the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in
whole or in part to the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and (ii) in respect of indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
as provided in the Company Charter

 



39  Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect
on the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from
and after the Effective Time, shall cause the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less
favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of
directors, officers, managers and employees and indemnification than are set
forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In
addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume all obligations to pay any expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 5.7_
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this _Section 5.7_) as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent
required by applicable Law.

(b) Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide
access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or
cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may
be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any
additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to
such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or
Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less
favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that, if the aggregate annual premiums
for such insurance shall annually exceed $1,500,000 (the " _Maximum Amount_
"), then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the
applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at
the Maximum Amount; _provided_ that any such replacement or substitution of
insurance policies shall not result in gaps in coverage; _provided further,
however_ , that at no time shall such coverage be less than the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage then provided by Parent to its
directors and officers. If Parent in its sole discretion elects, then Parent
may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the
Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such
Indemnitees in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall the
cost of such policy exceed six times the Maximum Amount and, if such a
"tail policy" is purchased, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have
no further obligations under this _Section 5.7(c)_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the 

 



40  Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this  _Section 5.7_ applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.7_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_).

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 5.7_.

SECTION 5.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 7.3_, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting
and all other fees and expenses of third parties, incurred by a party in
connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall be
responsible for and shall pay the amount of any (i) documentary, sales,
use, real property transfer, real property gains, registration, value-added,
transfer, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
imposed on Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any Transfer
Taxes imposed on the stockholders of the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in respect of assets that
are owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.9 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company and
Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company in
connection with the Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

SECTION 5.10 _Employee Matters_. Parent shall, for a period of twelve (12)
months immediately following the Closing Date, cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") with
compensation and employee benefits that, taken as a whole, are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits provided
by the Company and its Subsidiaries to Company Employees prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to provide
equity or equity-based compensation and (b) no plans or arrangements of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for equity or equity-based
compensation shall be taken into account in determining

 



41  whether compensation and employee benefits are comparable in the aggregate.
Parent or one of its Affiliates shall recognize the service of Company
Employees with the Company prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent
and its Affiliates in connection with any tax-qualified pension plan, 401(k)
savings plan, vacation or other paid time off, service awards, severance and
other welfare benefit plans and policies maintained by Parent or one of its
Affiliates which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent or one
of its Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility,
benefit entitlement and benefit accruals; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be recognized for purposes of any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits. Parent shall (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive,
all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company
Employees under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
which is made available to Company Employees following the Closing Date by
Parent or one of its Affiliates (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), except to the extent that such pre-existing or at-work
condition would have been applicable under the comparable Company welfare
benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide credit
to Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by such employees under the employee benefit plans, programs
and arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the portion of
the relevant plan year including the Closing Date. Nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time to terminate the employment of any Company
Employee at any time and for any or no reason. The provisions of this _Section
5.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and,
without limiting the generality of  _Section 8.6_, no Company Personnel or
any other individual associated therewith (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this  _Section 5.10_
shall create such rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that
may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Plan or any
employee program or any plan or arrangement of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute a
limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Effective
Time any such plans or arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, and nothing herein shall be construed
as an amendment to any Company Plan for any purpose.

SECTION 5.11  _Delisting_. Parent shall cause the Companys securities to be
de-listed from the NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 5.12 _Purchaser and Surviving Corporation_. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to
perform promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement and (b)
ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall not conduct any
business, make any investments or incur or guarantee any indebtedness, other
than acquiring Shares pursuant to the Offer and consummating the Merger
pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 5.13  _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Acceptance Time. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

 



42 SECTION 5.14 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that all payments made and benefits granted after the
date hereof to any Covered Security Holder pursuant to any compensation,
benefit or fringe benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement or Contract (i)
will be paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future
services to be performed or future services to be refrained from
performing (and matters incidental thereto) by the applicable Covered
Security Holder and (ii) will not be calculated based on the number of shares
of Company Common Stock tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the
applicable Covered Security Holder.

(b) The Company agrees that the Company (acting through the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board) will promptly take all such steps as may be
required to cause to be exempt as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" under Rule 14d-10(d)(1) promulgated under
the Exchange Act any compensation, benefit or fringe benefit plan, program,
policy, arrangement or Contract that will be entered into by the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with Company Personnel or future
directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Affiliates and to
ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of
such rule. Promptly upon Parent or any of its Affiliates entering into any
such arrangement with any Company Personnel or future director, officer or
employee of the Company and its Affiliates, Parent will provide to the
Company any and all information concerning such arrangements as may be needed
by the Company to comply with this _Section 5.14_.

 

SECTION 5.15 _Company Indebtedness_. The Company shall comply with all
provisions of (i) the Indenture dated as of October 31, 2007 between the
Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, with respect to the
Companys 2.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2037-Series A, as amended
(the " _Series A Indenture_ "), (ii) the Indenture dated as of October 31,
2007 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, with
respect to the Companys 2.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2037-Series
B, as amended (the " _Series B Indenture_ " and collectively with the Series
A Indenture, the " _Indentures_ "), (iii) the Company Credit Agreement and
(iv) all other Contracts governing the Series A Convertible Notes, the Series
B Convertible Notes or the indebtedness incurred under the Company Credit
Agreement, in each case including by providing all notices to holders of the
Series A Convertible Notes, Series B Convertible Notes and lenders under the
Company Credit Agreement required in connection with the Transactions. The
Company shall not amend any provision of the Company Credit Agreement, the
Indentures described in the immediately preceding sentence or any other
Contract governing the Series A Convertible Notes, the Series B Convertible
Notes or the indebtedness incurred under the Company Credit Agreement.

holders of Company Common Stock, if, and to the extent required by,
applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation of the Company, in order
to consummate the Merger;

Offer in breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 6.2 _Frustration of Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 6.1_

failure to act in good faith or use its reasonable best efforts to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject to
_Section 5.3_.

ARTICLE VII

_Termination_

 

SECTION 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the

the Acceptance Date, the Independent Director Approval contemplated by
_Section 1.3_) and the Board of Directors of Parent;

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

non-appealable injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling was primarily
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(ii) prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be

(iii) if, as the result of the failure of the Minimum Condition, the Offer
shall have terminated or expired in accordance with its terms without
Purchaser having accepted for payment and paid for any Shares pursuant to the

this _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ shall not be available to Parent if Parent or

Company having complied in all material respects with _Section 5.2_ and (3)
the concurrent payment by the Company to Parent of the Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 7.3_; or

date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be

45  Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (B) Parent or Purchaser shall have
breached or failed in any material respect to perform or comply with any
obligation, agreement or covenant required by this Agreement to be performed
or complied with by them, which inaccuracy, breach or failure (in each case

period; or

representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date which are true and correct as of such date), except where the failure of

true and correct, on and as of the date of such determination as if made on
such date (other than those representations and warranties that address

failure is judicially excused) shall not be entitled to such cure period;

 

SECTION 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant

the last sentence of _Section 5.5_, (iii) _Section 5.8_, (iv) _Section
7.2_, (v) _Section 7.3_, (vi) _Article VIII_ and (vii) the Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with its terms, all of which shall survive termination
of this Agreement, and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent or
the Company or their respective directors, officers, Affiliates,
employees, Representatives or stockholders except (x) the Company may have
liability as provided in _Section 7.3_ and (y) nothing herein shall relieve
the Company, Parent or Purchaser from liability for any material or willful
breach of this Agreement. In the event of termination of this

 



46  Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ prior to the expiration of the Offer,
Parent and Purchaser will promptly terminate the Offer upon such termination
of this Agreement without the purchase of Shares thereunder. If the Offer is
terminated, all tendered Shares not theretofore accepted for payment shall
forthwith be returned to the tendering stockholders.

SECTION 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent concurrently with
such termination the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds;

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination
Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds immediately following such termination
of this Agreement; or

 

(c) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, any Person shall have announced,
commenced, publicly disclosed or made known to the Company Board a Takeover
Proposal, (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or
(B) by Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and (iii) at any time after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the expiration of the twelfth (12th)
month after the termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates any
Takeover Proposal with such Person or enters into a definitive agreement
related to any Takeover Proposal with such Person, then the Company shall pay
Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the earlier
of the date of such entry and the date of such consummation referred to in
clause (iii) above. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee more than once.

(d) For purposes of:

(i) _Section 7.3(c)_, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in _Section 5.2_ except that all references to "25%"
therein shall be deemed to be referenced to "50%".

 

(ii) This _Section 7.3_, " _Termination Fee_ " means $155,000,000, in cash,

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event any such
payment becomes due and payable, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee,
the Company (and the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives) shall have
no further liability to Parent and Purchaser hereunder. The
immediately preceding sentence shall not preclude any claim by Parent or
Purchaser based on a wrongful termination of this Agreement by the Company
(including a wrongful termination based upon noncompliance with _Section
5.2_).

 

(f) The Company shall reimburse and Parent and Purchaser for all of their
documented, out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the

 



47  Transactions, up to a maximum of $10,000,000, if this Agreement is
terminated (i) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ or  _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_. Such reimbursement shall be paid upon demand following such
termination, except that no payment shall be due under this _Section 7.3(f)_
if the Company has previously paid the Termination Fee. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties acknowledge that the reimbursement of expenses pursuant to
this _Section 7.3(f)_ shall not be the sole or exclusive remedy available to
Parent and Purchaser with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate
at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2_,
upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, as the case
may be, except that the agreements set forth in _Article II_ and _Section
5.7_, _Section 5.8_ and  _Section 5.10_ and any other agreement in this
Agreement which contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall
survive the Effective Time indefinitely and those set forth in _Section 5.8_,
_Section 7.2_,  _Section 7.3_ and this _Article VIII_ shall survive
termination indefinitely. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate
as of the Effective Time.

SECTION 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after approval of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby by stockholders of the Company, by written agreement of the parties
hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors (which in the
case of the Company after the Acceptance Date shall include the Independent
Director Approval contemplated by _Section 1.3_); _provided, however,_ that
following approval of the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company,
there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law
would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
approval.

Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,

the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions; _provided, that,_ in the case of the Company
following the Acceptance Date, the Independent Director Approval contemplated
by _Section 1.3_ is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, Parent or Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



48 SECTION 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be null and
void.

 

SECTION 8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts

parties and delivered to the other parties.

 

SECTION 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
together with Annex A hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. Except for the provisions of _Section 5.7_, nothing in this
Agreement, together with Annex A hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
the Confidentiality Agreement, is intended to and shall not confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable rights or
remedies by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence: (i) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have
the right, on behalf of the stockholders of the Company, to pursue equitable
remedies pursuant to _Section 8.8_ or, if such equitable remedies are not
sought or are not granted as a remedy, damages (which Parent and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the
stockholders of the Company, taking into consideration relevant matters,
including the total amount payable to the stockholders of the Company under
this Agreement and the time value of money, which, in each case, shall be
deemed in such event to be damages of the Company and shall be recoverable by
the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights granted pursuant to
this clause (i) will be enforceable on behalf of the stockholders of the
Company only by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, (ii)
following the Effective Time the provisions of _Article II_ hereof shall be
enforceable by any one or more of the stockholders of the Company to the
extent necessary to receive the Merger Consideration to which each such
stockholder of the Company is entitled pursuant to _Article II_ and (iii)
nothing in this Agreement shall modify, alter or otherwise derogate from any
right or remedy available to any stockholder of the Company under the Exchange
Act in connection with the Transactions.

SECTION 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
actions of Parent, Purchaser or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof). 

 



49 (b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to submit itself to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, in which case any Delaware state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) (such courts, collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") in the event

Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any Delaware Court and (iii) agrees
that it will not bring any claim or action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than a Delaware Court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in _Section 8.9_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY INVOLVING ANY
REPRESENTATIVE OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY

WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.7(c)_.

 

SECTION 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Courts, without
bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

SECTION 8.12  _Interpretation_.

(a) The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words " _include_ ," "
_includes_ " or " _including_ " are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words " _without limitation_." The words "
_hereof_ ," " _herein_ " and " _hereunder_ " and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "will" shall be construed
to have the same meaning as the word "shall". The word "extent" in the phrase
"to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "or" shall not be
exclusive. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise
defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Unless the context
otherwise requires, any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred
to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means
such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by
waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein; _provided_ that any agreement disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall indicate whether such agreement has been
amended, modified or supplemented. References to a Person are also to its
permitted assigns and successors.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

executed and delivered as of the date first above written.

[Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Merger] ANNEX A

_Conditions to the Offer_

The capitalized terms used in this Annex A have the meanings set forth in the
attached Agreement, except that the term "the Agreement" shall be deemed to
refer to the attached Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be
required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares
promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay
the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred to
above, the payment for, any tendered Shares, and (subject to the provisions
of the Agreement) may terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any
tendered shares if (i) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied at
the expiration of the Offer, (ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act shall not have expired or been terminated prior to the expiration of the
Offer or (iii) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, any of the
following conditions shall exist:

(a) there shall be any injunction, judgment, ruling, order or decree
instituted, issued or entered, or any Law (other than routine application of
the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act) enacted, issued, promulgated or
enforced, by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Company,
Parent or Purchaser which (i) restrains, enjoins or prohibits consummation of
the Offer or the Merger or makes the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
illegal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial
Detriment;

 

(b) there shall be pending (i) any proceeding, claim, suit or action brought
by any Governmental Authority seeking to (A) restrain, enjoin or prohibit the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or make the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger illegal or (B) impose a Substantial Detriment or (ii) any
proceeding, claim, suit or action brought by any other Person that (A)
relates to this Agreement or the Transactions and (B) would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

 

(c) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have been any events,
changes, effects or occurrences that have had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(d) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company (A) set forth in
_Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.4_ shall not be true and correct on and as of
the date of such determination as if made on such date, (B) set forth in
_Section 3.1(b)_, _Section 3.2(a)_,  _Section 3.2(b)_, _Section 3.2(d)_,
_Section 3.17_ and _Section 3.18_ shall not be true and correct, at and as
of the expiration of the Offer as if made on such date (other than those
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date which are true and correct as of such date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct as of such dates
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have more than a _de
minimis_ effect on the reasonably expected benefits of the Transactions to
Parent and Purchaser, or (C) otherwise set forth in the Agreement shall not be
true and correct, at and as of the expiration of the Offer as if

 



A-1   made on such date (other than those representations and warranties that
address matters only as of a particular date which are true and correct as of
such date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct as of such dates (without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) the Company shall have breached or failed in any
material respect to perform or comply with any obligation, agreement or
covenant required by the Agreement to be performed or complied with by it
prior to the expiration of the Offer, and such breach or failure has not been
cured or (iii) Parent shall not have received a certificate, dated the date of
the expiration of the Offer, signed on behalf of the Company by an authorized
officer, to the effect that none of the matters set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii) of this paragraph (d) shall have occurred; or

(e) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.
