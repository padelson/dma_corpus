result in any Net Sales. Similarly, any free Covered Product, which is
supplied to a Third Party in conjunction with the offer for sale, or sale of
any Covered Product (such free Covered Product being in an amount customary in
the industry), will not result in any Net Sales of such free Covered Product.

their respective Affiliates or Sublicensees for research and development
purposes shall similarly not result in any Net Sales.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

If any Covered Product is sold as part of a Combination Product, the Net Sales
for such Covered Product sold as part of a Combination Product, for the
purposes of determining whether the First Net Sales Milestone or the Second
Net Sales Milestone has been met in any period, shall be determined by
multiplying the Net Sales of such Combination Product (replacing "Covered
Product" with "Combination Product" in the definition of Net Sales above),
during the applicable period, by the fraction, A/(A+B), where A is the average
per unit sale price of such Covered Product when sold separately as a stand
alone Covered Product in finished form in the country in which the Combination
Product is sold and B is the average per unit sale price of the other active
ingredients contained in the Combination Product when sold separately as stand
alone products in finished form in the country in which the Combination
Product is sold, in each case during the applicable period or, if sales of
such stand alone Covered Product did not occur in such period, then in the
most recent period in which arms length fair market sales of such Covered
Product, as applicable, occurred. If such average sale price cannot be
determined for such Covered Product or any of the other active ingredients for
the purposes of determining whether the First Net Sales Milestone or the
Second Net Sales Milestone has been met in any period, the Net Sales amount
shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties based on the relative value
contributed by each component, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

  

Whenever conversion from any foreign currency shall be required for the
purposes of calculating Net Sales, the amount of such sales in foreign
currencies shall be converted into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate for
the relevant month as determined by Parent's then-current accounting policies
(the "Monthly Rate"), such Monthly Rate being determined as the last price
rate of exchange for such currencies on the last Business Day of the

Company's historical accounting practices have been established in the Company
Financial Statements), (ii) all landlords', workmen's, repairmen's,

those conditions), or at such other time, date and location as the parties
hereto agree in writing (such date hereinafter, the "Closing Date").

  

  

SECTION 2.4 Effective Time. Contemporaneously with or as promptly as

SECTION 2.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the

amended to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger

provided, that such certificate of incorporation shall (i) reflect as of the
Effective Time "FerroKin BioSciences, Inc." as the name of the Surviving
Corporation and (ii) omit the provisions relating to the incorporator of

(c) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, until

SECTION 2.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Each share of Company Capital Stock that is held in the treasury of the

Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.6(a) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount in cash (adjusted to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to:

  

  

(A) the quotient of (1) (x) the sum of (a) $100,000,000 and (b) all Closing
Cash, less (y) the sum of (a) all Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, (b) all
Closing Debt and (c) all Past Due Payables (the result of clause (x) minus

Price, divided by (2) the Fully Diluted Common Number (such result, the "Per
Share Merger Consideration"), which amount shall be payable following the
Effective Time pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.1 and the Escrow
Agreement; plus

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(B) the quotient of (1) the aggregate of any and all Milestone Payments
divided by (2) the Fully Diluted Common Number (such result, the "Per Share
Contingent Consideration"), which amount shall be payable following the
Effective Time pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.9;

  

  

(ii) each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Preferred Stock to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.6(a) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount of cash
(adjusted to the nearest whole cent) without interest, equal to:

  

  

(A) (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration times (2) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock (which may be fractional) into which such share of
Company Preferred Stock is convertible immediately prior to the Effective
Time, which amount shall be payable following the Effective Time pursuant to
and in accordance with Section 3.1 and the Escrow Agreement; plus

Time, which amount(s) shall be payable following the Effective Time pursuant

(c) All such shares of Company Capital Stock, when converted in accordance
with Section 2.6(b), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be

any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to Sections 2.9, 2.10,

Share Contingent Consideration with respect to such shares of Company Capital
Stock upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.1.

  

  

(d) Each issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of Merger Sub shall
be converted into and become as of the Effective Time one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 2.7 Treatment of Company Options.

Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, and that has not been exercised
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in consideration of payment to
the holder thereof (each, an "Optionholder") of an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to:

  

  

(i) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each unexercised Company
Option, whether vested or unvested, held by such Optionholder immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (B) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share
Merger Consideration less (2) the exercise price per share of such Company
Option (each such amount, an "Option Closing Payment"), which amount shall be
payable following the Effective Time pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 3.1 and the Escrow Agreement; plus

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each unexercised Company
Option, whether vested or unvested, held by such Optionholder immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Contingent Consideration
(each such amount, an "Option Contingent Payment"), which amount shall be
payable following the Effective Time pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 2.9.

  

  

(b) The Option Closing Payments and the Option Contingent Payments shall
constitute the sole consideration payable in respect of all canceled Company
Options and no additional consideration shall be paid in respect of any
canceled Company Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all necessary actions, including providing any required notice to
Optionholders, necessary to effect the transactions described in this Section
2.7 pursuant to the terms of the Company Option Plan and any agreement
evidencing a Company Option.

  

  

SECTION 2.8 Closing Certificate.

Stock and number of Company Options held by each such Equityholder, (C) each
Equityholder's Pro Rata Share and Contingent Pro Rata Share, (D) the portion

to each Milestone Payment to be received by each such Equityholder if the
applicable Milestone relating to such Milestone Payment occurs (assuming,
solely for purposes of such schedule, the payment in full of such Contingent
Allocation with no adjustments pursuant to Section 2.10). A preliminary
version of the Consideration Allocation Schedule shall be provided by the
Company to Parent at least six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
investigation or examination conducted, or any knowledge possessed or
acquired, by or on behalf of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates, (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation are
entitled to rely on the Consideration Allocation Schedule in making payment or
disbursement to any Equityholder pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates have any Liability to any Person (including the Equityholders'

by any Person (including Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their respective
Affiliates, the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Agent) in accordance with the

SECTION 2.9 Milestone Payments.

  

  

(a) Upon the first occurrence of any of the events set forth in the table

promptly (and in any event, (x) in the case of the Initiation of Phase III
Clinical Trial Milestone, the US Approval Milestone or the EU Approval
Milestone, no later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter and (y) in the case
of the First Net Sales Milestone or the Second Net Sales Milestone, no later
than forty-five (45) Business Days thereafter) deliver a notice to the
Equityholders' Representative of such occurrence and, within fifteen (15)
Business Days of such notice, deposit or cause to be deposited

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

the amount of cash in U.S. dollars set forth in the table below under
"Milestone Payment" opposite such Milestone subject to the adjustment set
forth in Section 2.9(l) (each, a "Milestone Payment") with the Equityholders'
Representative or its designated agent, in each case subject to the right of
set-off set forth in Section 2.10 and withholding rights set forth in Section
3.4 and less the portion of such amount, if any, allocable to Dissenting
Shares. Each Milestone Payment shall be paid by or on behalf of Parent in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of the
Equityholders' Representative or its designated agent with a bank designated
by the Equityholders' Representative by notice to Parent, which notice shall
be delivered within two (2) Business Days of the Equityholders'
Representative's receipt of notice of the Milestone Trigger Event and shall
include the name of the Equityholders' Representative's designated agent, if
any. Upon receipt of any Milestone Payment, the Equityholders' Representative
shall pay or cause to be paid to each Equityholder who is not a holder of
Dissenting Shares, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days, its
Contingent Allocation with respect to the Milestone Payment. Following the
payment of any Milestone Payment to the Equityholders' Representative or its
designated agent, each Equityholder shall look only to the Equityholders'
Representative (and not to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates) to receive such Equityholder's Contingent Allocation
with respect to such Milestone Payment. It is expressly understood and agreed
that Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates shall
have no Liability to any Equityholder for its Contingent Allocation with
respect to any Milestone Payment so long as such Milestone Payment has been
paid by or on behalf of Parent to the Equityholders' Representative or its
designated agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, in the event that Parent fails to deliver timely notice of a
Milestone Trigger Event to the Equityholders' Representative or fails to
deposit any Milestone Payment, in each case in accordance with this Section
2.9(a), then the applicable Milestone Payment shall bear interest from the
date upon which such Milestone occurred until the date of deposit with the
Equityholders' Representative or its designated agent at a rate per annum
equal to (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition in effect from time to time during such period plus (ii) one percent
(1%).

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the maximum aggregate amount Parent and
any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to pay pursuant to this Section 2.9
shall be $225,000,000 (inclusive of all Company Transaction Expenses of the
type referred to in Section 2.9(l)) and (ii) none of the Milestone Payments
shall be payable more than one time; provided, however, that in the event that
there occurs a Fundamental Circumstance, but Parent or any of its Affiliates
or Sublicensees pursues development of an Alternative Covered Product that
constitutes a Covered Product, then any remaining Milestone Payments that
first become due and payable following the occurrence of such Fundamental
Circumstance shall be one-half (1/2) the applicable amount set forth in the
table above. In the event that Parent believes that a Fundamental Circumstance
has occurred, Parent shall promptly provide notice thereof to the
Equityholders' Representative together with reasonable detail (based upon the
information then possessed by Parent) of the material facts known to Parent
giving rise to such belief.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Parent shall (y) from the Closing Date until the date each of the US
Approval Milestone and the EU Approval Milestone has been achieved, no later
than forty-five (45) days following each submission of an "Annual Report"
(described in Title 21 (21 C.F.R.) § 312.33) by the Surviving Corporation to
the FDA, deliver to the Equityholders' Representative a written memorandum
(each such memorandum, a "Progress Memo") containing (i) an Annual RandD Report
based on such "Annual Report" and (ii) a brief summary of the Surviving
Corporation's most recently available development plan prepared for its
internal use in respect of its plans for the coming year with respect to the
achievement of each of the Milestones that has not occurred as of the date of
such plan and (z) from the date of the first commercial sale of a Covered
Product (including any Combination Product) until the Second Net Sales
Milestone has been achieved, as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within ninety (90) days after each fiscal year following the commencement of
sales of a Covered Product (including any Combination Product), prepare and
deliver to the Equityholders' Representative a reasonably detailed statement
setting forth Net Sales and GAAP Net Sales for such fiscal year (each, a "Net
Sales Statement"). In addition, from the Closing Date until the date on which
each of the US Approval Milestone and EU Approval Milestone has been achieved,
Parent shall, once each fiscal year upon reasonable prior written notice,
cause the general manager of the Covered Products to meet with the
Equityholders' Representative and its representatives to discuss the Progress
Memo for the immediately preceding fiscal year.

  

  

(d) From the date of the first commercial sale of a Covered Product (including
any Combination Product) until the Second Net Sales Milestone has been
achieved, on not less than thirty (30) Business Days' prior written notice,
Parent shall permit an internationally recognized independent, certified
public accountant selected by the Equityholders' Representative (and if such
accountant is not a "Big Four" accounting firm, then Parent shall have the
right to approve the selected accountant (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) (the "Auditor"), to audit and
inspect solely those books and records of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Affiliates that are necessary to audit and inspect Net
Sales and GAAP Net Sales. The Auditor will only be entitled to disclose to the
Equityholders' Representative (i) whether the Auditor believes it has been
provided reasonable access to the relevant books and records to conduct an
audit and inspection in accordance with this Section 2.9(d), and if not, the
nature of any deficiencies in such access, (ii) any differences between the
Auditor's findings regarding Net Sales and GAAP Net Sales as determined by the
Auditor, on the one hand, and the calculations of Net Sales and GAAP Net Sales
set forth in any applicable Net Sales Statement and (iii) whether the First
Net Sales Milestone and/or the Second Net Sales Milestone were met. Such
inspections may be made no more than once each calendar year and during normal
business hours. The books and records for any particular calendar year shall
be subject to no more than one inspection, and in no event shall any
inspection be initiated with respect to any calendar year more than two (2)
years following the end of such calendar year. The Auditor shall be obligated
to execute a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent prior to commencing any such inspection. Inspections
conducted under this Section 2.9(d) shall be at the sole cost and expense of
the Equityholders' Representative; provided, however, that if by virtue of an
inspection it is determined that Parent failed to notify the Equityholders'
Representative in a timely manner under Section 2.9(a) of the occurrence of
the First Net Sales Milestone or the Second Net Sales Milestone, then Parent
shall bear the cost and expense of such inspection.

  

  

(e) The Equityholders' Representative and each Permitted Recipient (i) shall
hold in confidence and shall not disclose to any other Person all information
provided to it pursuant to Sections 2.9(c) and 2.9(d) except to the extent
that such information can be shown to have been in the public domain through
no fault of the Equityholders' Representative, any

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

Permitted Recipient or any of their respective Affiliates and (ii) shall not
use such information other than solely to assess the value of, the progress
towards, and the probability of, achieving the Milestone Payments and to
determine or enforce the Equityholders' right to receive such Milestone
Payments; provided, that the Equityholders' Representative may disclose such
information to (x) the employees, advisors and consultants of the
Equityholders' Representative to the same extent, and under the same
conditions, as information may be disclosed to such Persons pursuant to the
last sentence of Section 10.1(c) and (y) the Permitted Recipients so long as
each such Permitted Recipient (A) is informed of the confidential nature of
such information and (B) executes a confidentiality agreement with the
Equityholders' Representative regarding such information (1) that is
comparable to and no less restrictive than the terms of this Section 2.9(e)
with respect to the Equityholders' Representative, (2) contains the
acknowledgement and agreement referred to in the last sentence of this Section
2.9(e) and (3) to which Parent is made an express third party beneficiary. At
the request of Parent, the Equityholders' Representative shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered to Parent, true and correct copies of each such
confidentiality agreement. Any Permitted Recipient receiving such information
shall not disclose such information to any Person, including to any
prospective or current limited partner or other investor of such Permitted
Recipient; provided, however, that a Permitted Recipient that is a venture
capital fund may, (i) disclose such information to its auditors for purposes
of enabling such auditors to confirm the reasonableness of the methodology
utilized by such venture capital fund in valuing its expected return from the
Merger; provided that such auditing firm agrees to enter into a
confidentiality agreement regarding such information (A) that is comparable to
and no less restrictive than the terms of this Section 2.9(e) with respect to
the Equityholders' Representative, (B) contains the acknowledgement and
agreement referred to in the last sentence of this Section 2.9(e) and (C) to
which Parent is made an express third party beneficiary and (ii) disclose to
prospective and current limited partners the valuation such venture capital
fund has placed on its expected return from the Merger and a general statement
of the likelihood that the Milestone Payments will be received (e.g., a "high
likelihood", a "low likelihood", "a greater or less than 50% likelihood",
etc.) (it being understood that in no event shall such general statement
include any specifics regarding any Covered Product or the progress in
achieving the Milestones (including details of the type included in Annual RandD
Reports or the Net Sales Statements) that are not generally available
publicly). The Equityholders' Representative acknowledges and agrees, and each
Permitted Recipient receiving information of the type described above shall
acknowledge and agree as part of the confidentiality agreement required to be
executed by such Permitted Recipient, that (x) the information provided
pursuant to Sections 2.9(c) and 2.9(d) may contain material non-public
information concerning Parent and its Affiliates, (y) it shall comply with
applicable securities laws regarding the trading of securities of Parent and
its Affiliates while in possession of any such material non-public
information, including any restrictions imposed by such laws prohibiting any
Person who has received any such material non-public information from
purchasing or selling securities of Parent and its Affiliates or from
communicating such information to any other Person under circumstances in
which it is reasonably foreseeable that such other Person is likely to
purchase or sell such securities and (z) Parent is relying upon its compliance
with the obligations under this Section 2.9(e) for purposes of compliance by
Parent and its Affiliates with Regulation FD promulgated by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (to the extent Parent or any of its
Affiliates is subject to such regulation).

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that the Company has not achieved the Initiation of the Phase III
Clinical Trial Milestone on or before [**redacted**] other than as a result of
a Fundamental Circumstance, then [**redacted**].

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Following the Closing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Affiliates shall have the right, in their sole and absolute
discretion, to direct and control the development, commercialization,
manufacture, marketing, distribution and selling of the Covered Products in
all respects, including the determination to test, develop, pursue, market,
make any regulatory filings, including any NDA or MAA filing, or seek any
Regulatory Approvals, including any marketing approvals in the United States
or the European Union, with respect to, or make any strategic product
portfolio decisions affecting, the Covered Products. None of this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents or any other fact, circumstance or matter
relating hereto or thereto (including the process of negotiation, execution
and implementation hereof or thereof) shall be construed to impose upon
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates any
express or implied obligation, duty or expectation to test, develop, pursue,
market, make any regulatory filings or seek any Regulatory Approvals with
respect to, or otherwise advance any Covered Product.

  

  

(h) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the date
on which each Milestone Payment shall have been delivered to the
Equityholders' Representative or its designated agent for the benefit of the
Equityholders, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates may not directly or indirectly consummate a Product Sale unless (i)
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates made
provision so that such acquirer assumes and succeeds to the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 2.9 and (ii)
prior to or simultaneously with the consummation of such Product Sale, such
acquirer delivers to the Equityholders' Representative an instrument of
assumption for the benefit of the Equityholders effecting the assumption and
succession described in the forgoing clause (i).

  

  

(i) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
grants, directly or indirectly, a license to any Sublicensee in any
jurisdiction pursuant to which such Sublicensee makes commercial sales of any
Covered Product to any third party, then Parent shall ensure that such
arrangement with such Sublicensee contains provisions requiring such
Sublicensee to (i) deliver to Parent the information required by Parent to
prepare and deliver to the Equityholders' Representative the Net Sales
Statements, (ii) keep accounts of all Net Sales and GAAP Net Sales, and
deliver to Parent the information required by Parent to calculate Net Sales
and GAAP Net Sales hereunder and (iii) if the Equityholders' Representative
initiates an inspection pursuant to Section 2.9(d), provide Parent with the
right to request access for the Auditor to audit and inspect the books records
of such Sublicensee in the same manner and to the same extent as required of
an audit and inspection of Parent's books and records pursuant to Section
2.9(d).

  

  

(j) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, if
[**redacted**] of GAAP Net Sales for a given fiscal year exceeds Net Sales for
such fiscal year, Net Sales for such fiscal year shall be deemed to be equal
to [**redacted**].

  

  

(k) The right of each Equityholder to receive such Equityholder's Contingent
Allocation with respect to any Milestone Payment shall not be evidenced by any
form of certificate or instrument, and does not represent any ownership or
equity interest in the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates and does not entitle any Equityholder to voting rights
or rights to dividend payments. The right of each Equityholder to receive such
Equityholder's Contingent Allocation with respect to any Milestone Payment
shall not be assignable or transferable except by (i) will, (ii) the Laws of
intestacy, (iii) other operation of Law or (iv) if such Equityholder is a
partnership or a limited liability company, pursuant to a

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

Permitted Disposition to one or more partners or members of such Equityholder
or to one or more Affiliates of such Equityholder; provided that, in each
case, written notice of such assignment and transfer shall be promptly
delivered to each of Parent and the Equityholders' Representative by the
transferor or assignor (or such transferor's or assignor's estate), which
notice shall expressly set forth the transferor or assignor and the transferee
or assignee, the rights to which such transfer or assignment related and the
effective date of such transfer; and, provided, further, that as a condition
to such transfer or assignment, the parties to such transfer or assignment
shall agree to provide to each of Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative, at their respective request, any additional evidence of the
transfer or assignment that Parent or the Equityholders' Representative, as
the case may be, may reasonably request. None of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Equityholders' Representative shall give effect to any
purported assignment or transfer made in contravention of this Section 2.9(k).
A "Permitted Disposition" means (a) a transfer or assignment by a Permitted
Recipient that is a venture capital fund to its limited partners pursuant to a
distribution that is made pro rata to such limited partners in accordance with
the terms of such Permitted Recipient's limited partnership or other governing
documents and without the payment of any additional consideration therefor and
(b) a transfer or assignment to a third party approved in writing in advance
by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement,
Parent shall have no obligation to approve any such transfer or assignment
pursuant to the foregoing clause (b) if such transfer or assignment cannot,
individually or taken together with any prior transfer or assignment and any
potential future transfers or assignments and other facts and circumstances,
be accomplished in a transaction that is, in Parent's reasonable judgment,
exempt from registration and qualification under, or would result in any other
material adverse consequences under, U.S. federal and state securities laws or
any other Law or would have an adverse Tax impact on Parent or its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation).

  

  

(l) For the purposes of calculating any Milestone Payment, the amount of cash
in U.S. dollars set forth in the table in Section 2.9(a) under "Milestone
Payment" opposite the applicable Milestone shall be reduced by the total of
all Company Transaction Expenses of the type referred to in clause (i) of the
definition thereof that would be payable if such amount set forth in the table
in Section 2.9(a) were paid in full to the Equityholders' Representative or
its designated agent (calculated without duplication of any Company
Transaction Expenses previously paid or deducted in determining the Merger
Consideration or any prior Milestone Payment).

  

  

SECTION 2.10 Set Off Right. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, in addition to
any other right hereunder, Parent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, from time to time to set off any indemnification payments alleged
by Parent to be owed by the Equityholders to the Parent Indemnified Parties at
such time pursuant to Article IX against any Milestone Payment that is owed
and has not yet been paid; provided that the aggregate amount that Parent may
set off as of a given time for indemnification payments owed by the
Equityholders to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)
and 9.2(b) in respect of breaches of the Specified IP Representations and
other non-Fundamental Representations shall not exceed the Specified Liability
Limit as of such time; provided, further that for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent's right to set off indemnification payments owed by the Equityholders
to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Sections 9.2(a) and 9.2(b) shall
in each case be subject to Parent having delivered notice of such claim to the
Equityholders' Representative in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Article IX within the applicable survival period specified in Section 9.1. If
it is finally resolved through negotiation or final, non-appealable decision
of a court of competent jurisdiction that all or a portion of any amount set
off by Parent was not entitled to be set off by

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

Parent, then Parent shall promptly pay the amount Parent was not entitled to
set off to the Equityholders' Representative or its designated agent plus
interest accruing from and including the date such amount was withheld from
the applicable Milestone Payment but excluding the date of payment at a rate
per annum equal to (a) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during such period plus (b) one
percent (1%).

  

  

ARTICLE III.

  

EXCHANGE OF COMPANY CERTIFICATES and COMPANY OPTIONS

  

  

SECTION 3.1 Exchange of Company Certificates and Company Options.

  

  

(a) Escrow Agent. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with Wells Fargo, N.A., in its capacity as the escrow agent (the
"Escrow Agent"), an amount of cash in U.S. dollars equal to the Escrow Fund.
The Escrow Fund (or any portion thereof) shall be distributed to the
Equityholders, the Equityholders' Representative and Parent at the times, and
upon the terms and conditions, set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement to be executed on or prior to the Closing by Parent, the Escrow
Agent and the Equityholders' Representative in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C (the "Escrow Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Sections 2.6 and 2.7, the Escrow Fund shall be deducted, pro rata in
proportion to each Equityholder's Pro Rata Share, from the aggregate amount
payable to each Equityholder pursuant to Sections 2.6(b)(i)(A), 2.6(b)(ii)(A)
and 2.7(a)(i). The adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders
and the delivery of the Letters of Transmittal and Optionholder Letters
pursuant to Section 3.1 shall constitute the agreement of such Equityholders
to be bound by and comply with the Escrow Agreement and all of the
arrangements and provisions of this Agreement relating thereto, including the
deposit of the Escrow Fund into escrow, the indemnification obligations set
forth in Article IX hereof and the appointment and sole authority to act on
behalf of the Equityholders of the Equityholders' Representative, as provided
for herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(b) Parent Deposits. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, cash in U.S. dollars (i) with Citibank, N.A., in its capacity as
the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of each
Equityholder who holds shares of Company Capital Stock, an amount (the
"Exchange Fund") equal to the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.6 after deducting the appropriate amount thereof
allocable to the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and (ii) with the
Surviving Corporation, an amount equal to the aggregate Option Closing
Payments after deducting the appropriate amount thereof allocable to the
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 3.1(a).

  

  

(c) Exchange Procedures for Company Capital Stock. At the Closing, Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid to each Equityholder of record who holds shares
of Company Capital Stock and has delivered to Parent at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (i) the stock certificates
representing such Equityholder's shares of Company Capital Stock
(collectively, such Equityholder's "Company Certificates") and (ii) an
executed and completed copy of a letter of transmittal in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D (each, a "Letter of Transmittal"), the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Certificates pursuant
to Section 2.6, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.1(a) and
withholding (if any) in accordance with Section 3.4. To the extent that an
Equityholder of record has not delivered the Company Certificates representing
all of such Equityholder's shares of Company Capital Stock as of the Closing
together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal on
or prior to the Closing Date, then, promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to such Equityholder (A) a Letter of
Transmittal

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company
Certificates in exchange for the portion of the Merger Consideration
receivable in respect of such Company Certificates, and following the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid, promptly following
surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such Company Certificates pursuant to Section 2.6, subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 3.1(a) and withholding (if any) in accordance with
Section 3.4. All such payments shall be made out of the Exchange Fund to the
extent it is then in existence, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Capital Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares of Company Capital Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Company
Certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by any documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid.

  

  

(d) Exchange Procedures for Company Options. To the extent that an
Optionholder has not delivered a properly completed and duly executed
Optionholder Letter with respect to all of such Optionholder's Company Options
as of the Closing, then, promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Surviving Corporation to mail to such Optionholder (i) an
Optionholder Letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (each, an
"Optionholder Letter") and (ii) instructions for use in obtaining the portion
of the Merger Consideration receivable in respect of cancelled Company
Options. Upon delivery of a duly executed and completed Optionholder Letter
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the instructions
thereto, in each case, on or prior to December 1, 2012, such Optionholder
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the aggregate Option
Closing Payments payable in respect of such Company Options pursuant to
Section 2.7, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.1(a) and
withholding (if any) in accordance with Section 3.4. All such payments shall
be made after the Closing by the Surviving Corporation from funds deposited by
or at the direction of Parent pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii), and shall be
made, (A) in the case of payments in respect of Company Options made to
Employee Optionholders, through Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's
payroll or treasury functions no later than three (3) Business Days following
Parent's receipt of the applicable Employee Optionholder's Optionholder
Letter, duly executed and completed, together with such other documents as may
be required pursuant to the instructions thereto, and, (B) in the case of all
other payments in respect of Company Options, in such manner as Parent
determines reasonably appropriate, including, if Parent elects, through the
Exchange Agent, as promptly as administratively practicable, but in any event
no later than ten (10) Business Days, following Parent's receipt of the
applicable duly executed and completed Optionholder's Optionholder Letter
together with such other documents as may be required pursuant to the
instructions thereto.

  

  

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock as of six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Capital Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration.

  

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates. If any Company Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and (ii) the

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

execution and delivery to the Exchange Agent by such Person of a bond of
indemnity in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Exchange Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them
with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the amount of
cash, without interest, that such Person would have been entitled to receive
had such Person surrendered such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate
to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.1(c), subject to withholding (if
any) in accordance with Section 3.4.

  

  

(g) Treatment of Unsurrendered Securities. No Per Share Contingent
Consideration, Option Contingent Consideration or proceeds in respect of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund or any Milestone Payments shall be paid pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to any Equityholder who has not surrendered
his, her or its Company Certificates in accordance with Section 3.1(c) or has
not delivered an Optionholder Letter in accordance with Section 3.1(d). Parent
shall timely provide to the Equityholders' Representative a list of all
Equityholders and/or Optionholders who have complied with the requirements of
the preceding sentence prior to any Milestone Payment being delivered to the
Equityholders' Representative or its agent.

  

  

(h) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
3.1, neither the Company, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

SECTION 3.2 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, if required by the DGCL, but only to the extent required
thereby, shares of Company Capital Stock which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such
shares of Company Capital Stock who have properly exercised appraisal rights
with respect thereto in accordance with the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the amount payable with
respect to such Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 2.6, and holders of
such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of
the appraised value of such shares of Company Capital Stock, subject to
withholding (if any) in accordance with Section 3.4, in accordance with the
provisions of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Capital
Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to the amount
payable with respect to such Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 2.6,
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for
appraisal and any other related instruments received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands and the exercise of such appraisal
rights under the provisions of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demand.

  

  

SECTION 3.3 No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company Capital Stock;
Closing of Company Transfer Books. At and after the Effective Time, each
holder of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights as a
stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case of a holder of Company
Capital Stock (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.6(a) or
Dissenting Shares), the right to surrender his or her Company Certificate in

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

exchange for payment of the amount payable with respect to such Company
Capital Stock pursuant to Section 2.6 or, in the case of a holder of
Dissenting Shares, to perfect his or her right to receive payment for his or
her shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the DGCL, and no transfer of
shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of shares of Company Capital
Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided for in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 3.4 Withholding Rights.

  

  

(a) Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Equityholder such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law; provided, however, (i) before making any such deduction or withholding
(other than deduction or withholding in respect of (A) federal income tax
withholding under Section 1441 or 1442 of the Code with respect to any amounts
treated as interest under Section 483 or 1274 of the Code, (B) Taxes with
respect to Option Payments and payments with respect to Company Restricted
Stock held by a current or former employee of any Acquired Company who has not
timely filed an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, and (C) backup
withholding, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall give
the Equityholders' Representative notice of the intention to make such
deduction or withholding (such notice, which shall include the authority,
basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding,
shall be given at least a commercially reasonable period of time before such
deduction or withholding is required, in order for the Equityholders to
obtain, if available, reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding, and the Equityholders' Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly provide copies of such notice to the
Equityholders), (ii) Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and
the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall cooperate with the Equityholders to the
extent reasonable in efforts to obtain, if available, reduction of or relief
from such deduction or withholding (other than with respect to a Company
Option held by an Employee Optionholder or Company Restricted Stock held by a
current or former employee of any Acquired Company) and (iii) Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent, as applicable,
shall timely remit to the appropriate Governmental Authority any and all
amounts so deducted or withheld and timely file all Tax Returns and provide to
the Equityholders' Representative such information statements and other
documents required to be filed or provided under applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent in accordance with the foregoing, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Equityholder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent
and the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, a portion of each Milestone Payment received by each Equityholder
(other than any Equityholder as to whom the receipt of such Milestone Payment
is treated as the receipt of compensation for such purposes) may be treated as
imputed interest to the extent required under Sections 483 and 1274 of the
Code.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE IV.

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

In connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub, the Company has delivered to Parent and Merger
Sub a disclosure schedule with numbered sections corresponding to the relevant
sections in this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). Any disclosure
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to a particular
representation or warranty contained herein shall be deemed to be a disclosure
with respect to all other applicable representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement if the applicability of such disclosure to any other
applicable representation or warranty would be reasonably apparent to a Person
reviewing the Company Disclosure Schedule, regardless of whether an explicit
reference to such other representation or warranty is made. Nothing in the
Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained in this
Agreement, and disclosure of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
not constitute an admission that such item is material or required to be
disclosed. Subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

  

SECTION 4.1 Authority.

  

  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Company, and no other corporate action on the part of the
Company is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than the Required Company Stockholder Vote. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties to this Agreement,
this Agreement constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be subject to (i) the effect of any applicable Law
of general application relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and relief of debtors
generally and (ii) the effect of rules of law and general principles of
equity, including rules of Law and general principles of equity governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at Law). The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of (x) a
majority of the shares of the outstanding Company Capital Stock, voting
together as a single class on an as-converted-to-Company Common Stock basis,
(y) at least 70% of the Company Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting
together as a single, separate class on an as-converted-to Company Common
Stock basis and (z) at least 75% of the outstanding shares of the Company
Preferred Stock designated as "Series B Preferred" voting as a single,
separate class, are the only votes of the holders of any Company Capital Stock
necessary (including under the DGCL, the Company Certificate of Incorporation
and the Company Bylaws) to adopt this Agreement (the "Required Company
Stockholder Vote").

  

  

(b) When so executed and delivered, the Written Consent shall constitute a
valid and effective adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company
Stockholder Vote in

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

compliance with applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and
Company Bylaws, and no other vote or action of the holders of any class or
series of the capital stock of the Company will be necessary under applicable
Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws or otherwise
to adopt this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

SECTION 4.2 Organization; Subsidiaries.

  

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, operate or lease the properties and
assets now owned, operated or leased by it, and to carry on the Business. The
Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in
good standing, under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties owned, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities,
makes such qualification necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing, when taken together with all
other failures by the Acquired Companies to be so qualified or in good
standing, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
True and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation (the "Company
Certificate of Incorporation") and Bylaws (the "Company Bylaws") of the
Company, each as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
been provided to Parent or its advisors prior to the date hereof. The Company
is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or the Company Bylaws.

  

  

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of the Company's Subsidiaries. Each of the
Subsidiaries of the Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation,
and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate or lease
the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it, and to carry on
the Business. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, under the Laws of each
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties owned, operated or
leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such qualification necessary,
except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, when taken together with all other failures by the Acquired
Companies to be so qualified or in good standing, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company owns directly or
indirectly all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of its
Subsidiaries. No Acquired Company has any other equity interest or profit
participation in any entity other than the Subsidiaries. No shares of Company

Company is not in compliance, in any material respect, with any applicable Law
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company is not under investigation

SECTION 4.12 Regulatory Matters.

  

  

(a) The Acquired Companies have obtained all Permits required by the FDA to
conduct the Business as it is currently conducted (the "FDA Permits"), except

all material respects with each such Permit held by or issued to it. The
Acquired Companies are the sole and exclusive owners of the FDA Permits and
the associated filings and applications with the FDA, including any
investigational new drug application and any comparable regulatory application
or filing (including any and all non-U.S. counterparts thereof) made or held
by or issued to the Acquired Companies (collectively, the "Company Regulatory

inspections or reviews) against any Acquired Company or, with respect to the
Product and to the Knowledge of the Company, any Person that manufactures or
develops the Product pursuant to a development, manufacturing, supply or other
collaboration arrangement with an Acquired Company ("Collaborative Partners")
by the FDA or any other Governmental Authority which regulates the development
of pharmaceutical products. Since January 1, 2008, there have been no written
notices to any Acquired Company or, with respect to the Product and to the

product of any Acquired Company or any product candidate of any Acquired
Company. Since January 1, 2008, there have been no (i) establishment
inspection reports, (ii) warning, untitled or action letters, (iii) orders,

Governmental Authority, and there are no proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened that reasonably might be expected to
result in criminal or civil Liability or debarment or disqualification by the
FDA or any other Governmental Authority. No Acquired Company has committed any
act, made any statement or failed to make any statement that would reasonably
be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to invoke its policy with respect
to "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal
Gratuities" or for any other Governmental Authority to invoke any similar
policy.

any other Governmental Authority or institutional review board that has or had
jurisdiction over any such clinical trial has initiated, or, to the Knowledge
of the Company with respect to the foregoing and with respect to a clinical
investigator who has participated in any such clinical trial, threatened to
initiate, any Action to place a clinical hold order on, or otherwise

clinical investigator or other person or entity involved in any such clinical
trial.

generally commercially available on standard and non-discriminatory pricing
terms), and the jurisdiction in which such item of Registered Proprietary
Rights has been registered or filed and the applicable application,
registration, or serial or other similar identification number. The Acquired
Companies have made all filings and payments and taken all other actions
required to be made or taken to maintain and/or renew (as applicable) each
item of material Registered Proprietary Rights set forth on Section 4.15(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule in full force and effect by the applicable
deadline and otherwise in accordance with all applicable Laws, except with
respect to any Registered Proprietary Rights licensed to an Acquired Company
as to which such Acquired Company does not possess the rights to take such
actions pursuant to the applicable license agreement.

  

  

(b) Each Acquired Company owns or has a valid and enforceable right or license
to use all Proprietary Rights and Technology necessary for, used or held for
use in connection with, the conduct of the Business as currently conducted.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance
by the Company of its obligations hereunder, or the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
extinguish, render invalid, alter, encumber or impair any Proprietary Rights
or the right to bring an action for the infringement of any such Proprietary
Rights by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation).

  

  

(c) None of the Acquired Companies is a party to or otherwise bound by any
agreement that imposes material restrictions on the use, license or transfer
of the Company Owned IP or Company Licensed IP.

  

  

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Acquired Companies has
infringed, induced or contributed to the infringement of, misappropriated or
otherwise violated any Proprietary Rights of any third party in any material
respect.

  

  

(e) There is no Action pending against, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company with respect to any Company Owned IP or Company
Licensed IP (i) challenging or seeking to deny or restrict, the rights of any
Acquired Company in any of the Company Owned IP or the Company Licensed IP,
(ii) alleging that the use of the Company Owned IP or the Company Licensed IP
or any services provided, processes used or products manufactured, used,
imported, offered for sale or sold by any Acquired Company do or may conflict
with, misappropriate, infringe or otherwise violate any Proprietary Right of
any third party or (iii) alleging that any Acquired Company has infringed,
induced or contributed to the infringement of, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any Proprietary Right of any third party.

  

  

(f) No Acquired Company has received written notice of any claim that any
Registered Proprietary Rights are invalid or unenforceable and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no such claim has otherwise been threatened against
any Acquired Company. None of the Registered Proprietary Rights included in
the Company Owned IP, or to the Company's

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

Knowledge, Company Licensed IP has been adjudged invalid or unenforceable in
whole or in part by a Governmental Authority (other than in the ordinary
course of prosecution of any patent applications included in such Registered
Proprietary Rights). All Registered Proprietary Rights included in the Company
Owned IP and, to the Knowledge of the Company, Company Licensed IP, in each
case that are issued, registered or granted, are valid, enforceable, in full
force and effect and subsisting in all material respects.

  

  

(g) The Acquired Companies are the sole owners of all Company Owned IP, and

(h) Each Acquired Company has taken reasonable measures in accordance with
normal industry practice to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all

Company is contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof, and no
such Company Owned IP and Company Licensed IP has been disclosed, other than
to employees, representatives, independent contractors, collaborators,
licensors, licensees, agents, advisors and potential acquirers of such
Acquired Company, all of whom are bound by written confidentiality agreements,
or to such Acquired Company's legal, business or financial advisors, all of
whom are bound to keep such Company Owned IP and Company Licensed IP,
confidential, whether by written agreement or otherwise. Each Person who is or
was an employee or contractor of an Acquired Company and who created or
developed any material Company Owned IP has signed an agreement containing an
assignment to an Acquired Company of all Proprietary Rights in such Person's
contribution to the Company Owned IP. To the extent that any Company Owned IP

Acquired Company, such Acquired Company has a written agreement with such
third party pursuant to which such Acquired Company either (i) has obtained

stored or contained therein or transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized
use, access, interruption, modification or corruption, including but not
limited to the implementation of commercially reasonable (i) data backup, (ii)
disaster avoidance and recovery procedures and (iii) business continuity
procedures, in each case consistent with industry practices.

  

  

(j) Each Acquired Company is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws relating to privacy, data protection and the collection and
use of personal information and user information gathered or accessed in the
course of the operations of such Acquired Company. Each Acquired Company is in
compliance in all material respects with all rules, policies and procedures
established by such Acquired Company from time to time with respect to the
foregoing. No claims have been asserted or threatened against any Acquired
Company (and to the Knowledge of the Company, no such claims are likely to be
asserted or

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

threatened against any Acquired Company) by any Person alleging a violation of
such Person's privacy, personal or confidentiality rights under any such Laws,
rules, policies or procedures.

4.15(j) above, each Acquired Company has at all times taken all steps

SECTION 4.17 Employee Benefit Matters.

  

  

(a) Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true,
correct and complete list of each material employee benefit plan (including
any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and any stock
purchase, stock option, restricted stock and stock units, share appreciation
rights, severance, employment, consulting, change-in-control, fringe benefit,
bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, vacation, group or individual health,
dental, medical, life insurance, survivor benefits, and any employment,
deferred compensation, severance, consulting or similar contract or agreement
(including any offer letter other than an offer letter terminable at-will,
without the incurrence of any Liability other than COBRA) and all other
material employee benefit plans, Contracts, agreements, programs, policies or
other arrangements relating to employee benefits or entitlements, whether oral
or written, whether or not subject to ERISA) maintained or contributed to by
an Acquired Company for the benefit of any current or former employees and any
individual independent contractors of the Acquired Companies or with respect
to which the Acquired Companies have any Liability (each, a "Company Benefit
Plan" and, collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"). Prior to the date
hereof, the Company has provided to Parent and its agents and representatives,
as applicable, copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan, including schedules
and financial statements attached thereto, (ii) the most recent annual report
(Form 5500) filed with the IRS with respect to each

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

such applicable Company Benefit Plan, (iii) each trust agreement and any other
material written agreement (including any material amendment) relating to each
such Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent summary plan description for
each such Company Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is
required, together with any summary of material modifications thereto, (v) the
most recent determination or opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to
any such Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code and (vi) for any oral plan, agreement, program or arrangement, a
written summary thereof.

  

  

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan, in all material respects, has been established
and administered in accordance with its terms, and is in compliance with the
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. There
are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits in
the normal course). Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter issued by the IRS and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
circumstances exist which could reasonably result in loss of such
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  

  

(c) No Company Benefit Plan is, and neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has any obligations with respect to (i) any "employee pension plan,"
as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Code Section 412 or (ii) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA Section
3(37)).

  

  

(d) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as
described in ERISA Section 3(40) or a "multiple employer plan" as described in
ERISA Section 210(a) or Section 413(c) of the Code.

  

  

(e) No Company Benefit Plan provides, nor has the Company nor any Acquired
Company undertaken to provide, for medical or welfare benefits (through
insurance or otherwise), or for the continuation of such benefits or coverage,
in any case, after retirement or other termination of employment, except as
may be required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B
of the Code or similar state or foreign Law (collectively, "COBRA").

  

  

(f) Each Company Benefit Plan that constitutes a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
documented, operated and maintained in accordance with a good faith,
reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and its purpose, as
determined under applicable guidance of the Department of Treasury and
Internal Revenue Service, with respect to amounts deferred (within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code).

  

  

(g) No Company Benefit Plan exists that, as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or
in connection with any subsequent event(s)), could reasonably be expected to
result in (i) the increase, acceleration, cancelation of a Debt or provision
of any payments, benefits or other rights to any employee, officer, director
or consultant, whether or not any such payment, right or benefit would
constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code or (ii) an obligation to fund or otherwise set aside assets to secure to
any extent any of the obligations under the Company Benefit Plan.

  

  

(h) Each Company Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated, subject to such
constraints as may be imposed by applicable Law, without incurring any
Liability therefor

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

or additional payment outside of the ordinary course in connection therewith
(other than routine administrative costs), except for any claims incurred
prior to such amendment or termination.

  

  

(i) The Company has made all material contributions and premium payments
required to have been paid through the date hereof with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan or, to the extent (if any) not paid, have been reflected
as a Liability in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis with the
Company's historical financial practices.

  

  

(j) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement
(whether oral or written) by an Acquired Company relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan which would
materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company Benefit Plan above
the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent
fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof.

  

  

SECTION 4.18 Labor Matters. No Acquired Company is a party to any labor
agreement with respect to its employees with any labor organization, group or
association, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, have there been any
attempts to organize the employees of any Acquired Company during the two-year

there is no labor strike, labor disturbance or work stoppage against any
Acquired Company. Within the past year, no Acquired Company has incurred any
material Liability or obligation under the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or any other similar state or local Law that remains
unsatisfied. Each of the Acquired Companies is in material compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting labor, employment and employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment, health and safety, worker's compensation,
immigration, employee classification, collection and payment of withholding
Taxes, Social Security Taxes and similar Taxes, and wages and hours. To the

of an Environmental Claim against any Acquired Company or violation by any
Acquired Company of any applicable Environmental Law, (b) no Action, request
for information or penalty is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has
been threatened, against any Acquired Company concerning any Hazardous
Materials Activities of such Acquired Company, or Hazardous Materials
Activity, (c) each Acquired Company is and has been in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws and (d) the Acquired Companies have delivered or
otherwise made available for inspection to Parent true, complete and correct

owned, operated or leased by any Acquired Company, or regarding any Acquired
Company's compliance with, or Liability under, applicable Environmental Laws.

the Business, (b) has entered into any Contract, transaction or business
dealing involving any Acquired Company, (c) is competing with any Acquired

rights to receive compensation for services performed as an officer, director

based upon any arrangements made by or on behalf of any Acquired Company. The

the Company Financial Advisor to Parent.

  

  

SECTION 4.22 Suppliers. Section 4.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists,
by dollar volume paid for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, the ten
largest suppliers to the Acquired Companies. As of the date of this Agreement,

Knowledge of the Company, (a) no Person listed in such Schedule within such
twelve month period has cancelled or otherwise terminated or threatened in
writing to cancel or otherwise terminate the relationship of such Person with
any Acquired Company or has decreased materially or threatened in writing to
decrease or limit materially, its services, supplies or materials to any

property, fire, liability, worker's compensation, errors and omissions and
other forms of insurance (other than title insurance) owned or held by the

insurance policies and all amendments and riders thereto to Parent. All such
policies are in full force and effect, and all premiums with respect thereto
covering all periods up to the date hereof have been paid, and no notice of

amendments or supplements thereto will, when first mailed to Equityholders,
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of

Affiliates or any director or officer of the Company or any of its Affiliates,
or any consultant, agent or other Person acting for or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Affiliates, has taken any action that would result in a

of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of its respective obligations hereunder, and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of each

Parent is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in
good standing, under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties owned, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities,
makes such qualification necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing, when taken together with all
other failures by Parent to be so qualified or in good standing, would not
have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.3 Conflicts. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of its

Parent or Merger Sub, (b) conflict with or result in a violation of any
Governmental Order or Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective assets or properties or (c) result in a breach of, or constitute a
default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both,

amendment, modification, acceleration or cancellation of or loss of any
benefit under any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, or by
which any of the assets or properties of Parent or Merger Sub is bound or
affected, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 5.3, as
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its respective obligations under
this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (a) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL, (b) applicable requirements, if
any, under the DGCL, federal or state securities or "blue sky" Laws, (c) such
filings as may be required under the HSR Act and (d) where the failure to
obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing
or notification would not, when taken together with all other such failures by
Parent and Merger Sub, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its respective
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.5 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment bank is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission from the Company or any of its

sufficient immediately available funds to pay, in cash, the Merger
Consideration and to perform Parent's other obligations under this Agreement
and under any other agreement entered into in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

SECTION 5.7 Due Diligence Investigation. Parent has had an opportunity to
discuss the business, management, operations and finances of the Acquired
Companies with their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives and affiliates, and has had an opportunity to inspect the
facilities of the Acquired Companies. Parent has conducted its own independent
investigation of the Acquired Companies. In making its decision to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent has relied solely upon the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Article IV and the other Transaction Documents (and

whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be construed
to limit a party's remedies with respect to any act of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

Agreement, during the Pre-Closing Period, upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours, the Company shall, and shall cause each Acquired
Company and each Company Representative to, (a) afford the officers, employees
and authorized agents and representatives of Parent reasonable access to the
offices, properties, officers, Contracts, systems, books and records of the
Acquired Companies and (b) furnish to the officers, employees and authorized
agents and representatives of Parent such additional financial and operating
data and other information regarding the assets, properties and business of
the Acquired Companies as Parent may from time to time reasonably request in
order to assist Parent in fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and
to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that any access or investigation pursuant to
this Section 6.3 shall be conducted in such manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with any of the operations or business activities of any Acquired
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Acquired Company shall be required
to provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure
would waive the attorney-client privilege of any Acquired Company or
contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement; provided that such Acquired Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents and take such other actions
(such as the entry into a joint defense agreement or other arrangement to
avoid the loss of attorney-client privilege) to permit such access or
disclosure.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 6.4 Confidentiality. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree to be bound by
and comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force
and effect until the Effective Time or until such agreement terminates
pursuant to its terms, such that the information obtained by Parent and Merger
Sub, or their respective officers, employees, agents or representatives,
during any investigation conducted pursuant to Section 6.3, or in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise, shall be
governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.5 Efforts; Consents; Regulatory and Other Authorizations.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party to this
Agreement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to promptly
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of, and give
all notices to and make all filings with, all Governmental Authorities and
other third parties that may be or become necessary for the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including those consents set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, (iii) lift or rescind any injunction or
restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to this Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv) fulfill all conditions to the such party's obligations
under this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each party to this Agreement shall cooperate fully with the other parties to
this Agreement in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals, giving such notices, and making such filings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, in connection with obtaining such consents from third parties, no
party to this Agreement shall be required to (and without the prior written
consent of Parent, no Acquired Company shall) make payments, commence
litigation, divest or hold separate any assets, enter into any settlement,
consent decree or other agreement with any Governmental Authority or agree to
modifications to the terms and conditions of any Contract with third parties.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall not
acquire (by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or assets or
otherwise) any corporation, partnership or other business organization or
division thereof or any equity interests therein if such acquisition would, or
would reasonably be expected to, lead to any material delay in obtaining or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining any approval under any antitrust
Law necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of Section 6.5(a), to
the extent required by applicable Law (it being understood that as of the date
of this Agreement, the parties do not believe such a filing is necessary under
applicable Law), each of Parent and the Company shall file, or cause to be
filed, a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) days of the
date of this Agreement (including a joint request for early termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act), shall supply promptly any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority (including the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice and the United States Federal Trade Commission) pursuant
to the HSR Act, and shall cooperate in connection with any filing under
applicable antitrust Laws and in connection with resolving any investigation
or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
commenced by any Governmental Authority, including the

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, or the office of any state attorney general.

  

  

(c) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to obtain the Required
Company Stockholder Vote within twenty-four (24) hours after the execution and
delivery hereof pursuant to executed written consents in the form attached as
Exhibit B to the Equityholder Undertaking (the "Written Consent"). The
materials submitted to the Company's stockholders in connection with the
Written Consent shall include the unanimous recommendation of the Company's
Board of Directors that the Company's stockholders vote their shares of
Company Capital Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement; provided
however, that, prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the
Company's Board of Directors may change such recommendation if the Company's
Board of Directors determines that it must take such action in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and provided further, that no
such change shall relieve the Company of its obligation to seek the Written
Consent pursuant to this Section 6.5(c). Promptly following receipt of the
Written Consent, the Company shall cause its corporate Secretary to deliver a
copy of such Written Consent to Parent. No later than ten (10) days after the
receipt by the Company of the Required Company Stockholder Vote pursuant to
the Written Consent, the Company shall deliver notice thereof (the
"Information Statement") to the stockholders of the Company in compliance with
Sections 228(e) and 262 of the DGCL, to the extent applicable. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Information Statement (if any) and any amendment or supplement thereto before
they are mailed to the Equityholders, and the Company shall consider in good
faith all comments of Parent and its counsel in connection therewith;
provided, however, that Parent shall in no way be responsible for any of the
content of the Information Statement except for information supplied in
writing by Parent expressly for inclusion therein.

  

  

(d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the
obligations of each Equityholder that is a party to the Amended and Restated
Voting Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2010, by and among the Company and the
Investors and Key Common Holders party thereto under Section 4 of such
agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.6 Further Action. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in
this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, such
further certificates, instruments and other documents, and to take, or cause
to be taken, such further actions, as may be necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to (i) indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of each Acquired Company (collectively, the "Company
Indemnified Parties"), against any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any
of the Company Indemnified Parties in connection with any Liabilities or any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent that the relevant Acquired Company would have been
permitted under applicable Law and under the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of
the relevant Acquired Company), as the case may be, in each case as in effect
on the date of this Agreement (but in each case, subject to the limitations on
the Surviving Corporation's ability to indemnify its

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

directors and officers under Section 145 of the DGCL), to indemnify such
Company Indemnified Parties and (ii) advance reasonable expenses of counsel as
incurred by any Company Indemnified Party in connection with any matters for
which such Company Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law or, if greater, under the Company Certificate of Incorporation
and Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the relevant
Acquired Company), in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and all rights of
appeal have lapsed that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation
and Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the relevant
Acquired Company), and pursuant to this Section 6.7(a); and provided further
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
expenses of more than one counsel for all Company Indemnified Parties in any
single Action unless a conflict of interest precludes the effective
representation of more than one Company Indemnified Party with respect to such
Action.

  

  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy or policies (i.e., "tail
coverage"), which policy or policies shall cover those persons who are
currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from
the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Closing Date, including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the premium for which shall be
treated as a Company Transaction Expense.

  

  

(c) The terms and provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the Company Indemnified Parties
by applicable Law, charter, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and representatives, each of whom is an intended third
party beneficiary of this Section 6.7.

  

  

SECTION 6.8 Employee Benefit Matters.

  

  

(a) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under any benefit
plan or arrangement (excluding vesting under any equity incentive plan and
benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Company Employees as of
the Effective Time shall receive service credit for service with the Acquired
Companies to the same extent such service credit was granted under the Company
Benefit Plans, subject to offsets for previously accrued benefits and
administered in a manner that does not provide for duplication of benefits.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare benefit
plan maintained for the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for the plan year that includes the
Closing Date under any welfare plans (other than a Company Benefit Plan) that
such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, Parent shall
provide (or cause the Surviving Corporation or another Affiliate of Parent to
provide) to employees of the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of
Parent who were employees of any Acquired Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") base compensation, bonus
opportunities, severance benefits and employee welfare and retirement benefits
(other than equity-based compensation arrangements) (such compensation and
benefits, collectively, "Employee Benefits") which are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the Employee Benefits provided to the Continuing Employees
of the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing. For the avoidance
of doubt, payments and benefits to any individual (including an employee of
any Acquired Company) who provides consulting services to Parent or any of its
Affiliates following the Effective Time shall be set forth in an individual
consulting agreement between such individual and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company to continue any specific Company
Benefit Plan or to continue the employment of any specific Person. The
provisions of this Section 6.8 are for the sole benefit of Buyer and the
Company and nothing in this Section 6.8, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to constitute an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or
any plan maintained Parent or its Affiliate (or an undertaking to amend any
such plan) or other compensation and benefits plan maintained for or provided
to Acquired Company employees, including Continuing Employees, prior to or
following the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) This Section 6.8 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.8,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.8.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 6.8 shall create
any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director
or consultant of any Acquired Company.

  

  

SECTION 6.9 Provision Respecting Legal Representation. Each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Latham
and Watkins LLP may serve as counsel to each and any holder of Company Capital
Stock and their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the
"Holder Group"), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Latham and
Watkins LLP (or any successor thereof) may serve as counsel to the Holder
Group or any director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the
Holder Group or the Equityholders' Representative, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such
representation and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and

shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation.

Equityholders' Representative that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by
Parent. Parent shall pay all such Transfer Taxes without deduction or
withholding from any consideration or amounts payable under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) FIRPTA Certificate. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a certification prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) and a notice prepared in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.897-2(h) certifying that interests in the Company are
not U.S. real property interests (it being understood that Parent shall be
authorized to deliver a copy of such certification to the Internal Revenue
Service after the Closing on behalf of the Company).

  

  

SECTION 6.11 Notice of Certain Events. During the Pre-Closing Period, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of:

  

  

(a) the failure of an Acquired Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied;

  

  

(b) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the

however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving the notice.

  

  

SECTION 6.12 Termination of Related Party Agreements and Accounts. All
agreements and accounts between an Acquired Company and each Related Party
(other than (i) agreements and accounts between Acquired Companies, (ii)
employment, severance, indemnification or other similar arrangements with

Company), and all such accounts shall be canceled, paid or otherwise settled

of an Acquired Company would be entitled to any payment or benefit as a result
of the transactions contemplated

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

by this Agreement and (ii) such payment or benefit would or could potentially
constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or could

under Section 4999 of the Code, prior to the Closing:

  

  

(a) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
binding written waiver by such "disqualified individual" (each, an "Excess

Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code (collectively, the "Excess Parachute Payments")
to the extent such Excess Parachute Payments are not subsequently approved
pursuant to a stockholder vote in accordance with the requirements of Section

Shareholder Approval Requirements");

(d) the Excess Parachute Waivers, disclosure to holders of Company Capital
Stock and any other resolutions, notices or other documents issued,
distributed, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this
Section 6.13 shall be subject to Parent's prior review and comment, and the
Company shall revise any such documentation to take into account any
reasonable comments made by Parent.

SECTION 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

  

  

(b) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other party if any Governmental Authority
with jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued a Governmental Order
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
Governmental Order shall have become final and non-appealable; provided,
however, that the terms of this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any
party if such party shall have breached in any material respect its
obligations under Section 6.5;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other party if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before April 23, 2012, unless the failure to consummate
the Merger on or prior to such date is the result of any breach in any
material respect of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.1(c);

  

  

(d) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a)
would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such
inaccuracy in Parent's and Merger Sub's representations and warranties or
breach by Parent or Merger Sub is curable by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the
Expiration Date through the exercise of reasonable efforts, then the Company
may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) prior to thirty
(30) days following the receipt of written notice from the Company to Parent
and Merger Sub of such breach (it being understood that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if it shall then be
in material breach of this Agreement or if such breach by Parent or Merger Sub
is cured so that such conditions would then be satisfied);

  

  

(e) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue; provided that if such inaccuracy in the
Company's representations and warranties or breach by the Company or such
Equityholder is curable by the Company prior to the Expiration Date through
the exercise of reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) prior to thirty (30) days following the
receipt of written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach (it being
understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(e) if it shall then be in material breach of this Agreement or if
such breach by the Company is cured so that such conditions would then be
satisfied); or

  

  

(f) by Parent, if within twenty-four (24) hours following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by all of the parties hereto the Company shall not
have delivered to Parent an Equityholder Undertaking in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit F (the "Equityholder Undertaking") and the Written Consent,
in each case duly executed by each of the Equityholders set forth on Schedule
III.

  

  

SECTION 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement and abandonment of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force or effect
whatsoever and there shall be no Liability on the part of any party to this
Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall relieve any party to this Agreement from any
Liability resulting from or arising out of any intentional, material breach of
any agreement or covenant in this Agreement; and provided, further, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of Section 6.4, this Section 8.2 and
Article X shall remain in full force and effect and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, whether in accordance with Section 8.1 or
otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE IX.

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

SECTION 9.1 Survival of Representations. The representations and warranties
made by the Company in Article IV shall survive the Closing and shall expire
on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, except that the
Fundamental Representations and the Specified IP Representations shall survive
the Closing and expire on the third anniversary of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that if, at any time prior to the applicable expiration date
referenced above, Parent (acting in good faith) delivers to the Equityholders'
Representative a written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or
a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company in
Article IV setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for Parent's belief
that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist and asserting a claim for recovery
under Section 9.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the expiration of the applicable time
period until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

  

  

SECTION 9.2 Right to Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article IX, from and after the Effective Time, each of the Equityholders,
severally and in proportion to each such Equityholder's respective Aggregate
Pro Rata Share of the Total Consideration as of such time, shall hold harmless
and indemnify each of Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and
Affiliates (the "Parent Indemnified Parties") against any Damages actually
incurred as a result of (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty set forth in Article IV (disregarding any exception or qualification
as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth therein), (b) any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in Article IV
as of the Closing Date as if such representation or warranty had been made as
of the Closing Date except for such representations and warranties that
address matters only as of a particular time, which need only be accurate as
of such time (disregarding any exception or qualification as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect set forth therein), (c) any breach or violation of any
covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement, (d) any
Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Company Transaction Expense or Past Due Payable
that was improperly accounted for or not accounted for in the determination of
the Merger Consideration or, in the case of any Company Transaction Expense,
any Milestone Payment, but, in each case, only to the extent that such
improper accounting or lack of accounting resulted in an overpayment of the
Merger Consideration or such Milestone Payment, (e) the exercise of
dissenters' rights or rights of appraisal by any holder or former holder of
Company Capital Stock (it being understood that the Parent Indemnified
Parties' Damages in respect of such exercise shall be equal to the amount, if
any, by which (i) the aggregate payment to such holder in respect of such
holder's Dissenting Shares, together with all reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) incurred by the
Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of such holder's exercise, exceeds (ii)
the product of the number of such holder's Dissenting Shares and the price per
share set forth on Section 9.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), (f) any
actual or alleged breach of fiduciary duty by an Equityholder or any present
or former director or officer of any Acquired Company prior to the Closing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Damages actually incurred by any
Acquired Company or any other Parent Indemnified Party arising from the
indemnification of, the advancement or reimbursement of expenses to, or the
payment of insurance proceeds (including self-insured retention or deductible
amounts, costs and expenses of pursuing claims and related increases in
insurance premiums) to, any such Person based upon any actual or alleged
breach of fiduciary duty of such Person prior to the Closing), (g) any actual
or alleged breach by the Company of the Amended and Restated Investors' Rights
Agreement dated as of June 3, 2010 by and among the Company, the investors
listed on the

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

Schedule of Investors attached thereto and the University of Florida Research
Foundation, Inc. (as such agreement may have been amended, modified or
supplemented), and (h) any inaccuracy in the Consideration Allocation
Schedule, including to the extent any Equityholder is entitled to receive any
amounts in connection with the Merger (in such Equityholder's capacity as an
Equityholder) in excess of the amounts indicated on the Consideration
Allocation Schedule.

  

  

SECTION 9.3 Limitations on Liability.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement (including Parent's right of set-off pursuant to Section 2.10 and
the provisions of this Agreement that provide for remedies including
injunctive relief or specific performance), the right of the Parent
Indemnified Parties to be indemnified from the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant
to this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any matter
arising under or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than any claims relating to the breach of a Fundamental
Representation, a Specified IP Representation, a Specified Covenant or claims
arising out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the Company or any
Person acting on the Company's behalf; provided that in no event shall any
Equityholder be liable to the Parent Indemnified Parties for Damages (i) in
excess of such Equityholder's Aggregate Pro Rata Share of such Damages as of
such time, (ii) in excess of the portion of the Total Consideration actually
received by such Equityholder as of such time or (iii) with respect to Damages
arising from or relating to breaches of any representations or warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement other than the Fundamental
Representations, in excess of the Specified Liability Limit as of such time.
Except as provided with respect to the Equityholders in the immediately
preceding sentence, no current or former stockholder, director, officer,
employee, affiliate or advisor of the Company shall have any Liability of any
nature to any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any matter arising
under or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.3,
nothing herein shall limit or otherwise affect Parent's rights or remedies in
respect of any breach by the Equityholders' Representative of Sections 2.9(a),
2.9(d), 2.9(e), 2.9(k), 3.4 or 10.1(c) or any breach or inaccuracy of any of
the Equityholders' Representative's representations or warranties set forth in
Section 10.1(e).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except for Damages resulting from a breach of a Fundamental Representation, a
Specified IP Representation or fraud or intentional misrepresentation, no
Equityholder shall be liable to a Parent Indemnified Party in respect of any
indemnification hereunder pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or (b) except to the
extent that the aggregate amount (without duplication) of Damages of the
Parent Indemnified Parties exceeds $750,000 (the "Deductible"), in which event
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the other limitations
contained herein, be entitled to be indemnified only against the portion of
Damages in excess of the Deductible. Without limiting Parent's right of set-
off pursuant to Section 2.10, any amounts payable by the Equityholders to a
Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2 shall be paid solely and
exclusively from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, except with respect to the breach of a Fundamental
Representation, a Specified IP Representation, a Specified Covenant (in which
case the Indemnity Escrow Fund must first be exhausted before recovery can be
made against any Equityholder) or fraud or intentional misrepresentation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for Damages resulting from a breach of a
Fundamental Representation, a Specified IP Representation or fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, no claim for indemnification may be made
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or (b) unless the amount of such claim (or series
of related claims arising from the same underlying facts) shall exceed
$25,000, and if the amount of such claim(s) does not exceed such amount, the
amount of such claim(s) shall not

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

be taken into account in determining whether or not or to the extent to which
the Deductible has been exceeded.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
Article IX for purposes of computing the amount of any Damages incurred by
Parent under this Article IX, there shall be deducted (i) an amount equal to
the amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized by Parent or any of its
Affiliates in connection with such Damages and (ii) an amount equal to the
amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution
payments or reimbursements actually received (net of costs of enforcement,
deductibles and retro-premium adjustments) by Parent or any of its Affiliates
in respect of such Damages (it being understood that Parent and any of its
Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds,
payments or reimbursements). To the extent that a claim for indemnification by
Parent or Merger Sub hereunder relates to a Liability incurred by the Company
and there is a specific accrual on the Current Balance Sheet in respect of
such Liability, then the determination of Damages in respect of such claim
shall be net of such accrual. If Parent or any of its Affiliates actually
realizes a Tax Benefit on account of such Damages after an indemnification
payment has been made to it, Parent or its Affiliates, as the case may be,
shall promptly pay (up to the amount of indemnification payment previously
made to Parent or its Affiliates with respect to such Damages) to the
Equityholders' Representative the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or
times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is actually realized by
Parent or its Affiliates, to the extent not previously offset against Damages
paid by the Equityholders. For purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall mean any
refund or credit of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which
otherwise would be owed by Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, actually
realized by Parent or its Affiliates in the taxable year in which the relevant
Damages were incurred or the subsequent taxable year.

  

  

SECTION 9.4 Claims and Procedures.

  

  

(a) If Parent determines in good faith that any Parent Indemnified Party has a
bona fide claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, Parent may
deliver to the Equityholders' Representative a certificate signed by any
officer of Parent (any certificate delivered in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 9.4(a), an "Officer's Claim Certificate"):

  

  

(i) stating that a Parent Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX;

  

  

(ii) to the extent possible, containing a good faith non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the amount to which such Parent Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled to receive, which shall be the amount of Damages such Parent
Indemnified Party claims to have so incurred or suffered or could reasonably
be expected to incur or suffer; and

  

  

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Parent) the material facts known to the Parent Indemnified Party
giving rise to such claim.

  

  

No delay in providing such Officer's Claim Certificate prior to the Expiration
Date shall affect a Parent Indemnified Party's rights hereunder, unless (and
then only to the extent that) the Equityholders are materially prejudiced
thereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) At the time of delivery of any Officer's Claim Certificate to the
Equityholders' Representative, if the Indemnity Escrow Account has not been
released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, a duplicate
copy of such Officer's Claim Certificate shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent by or on behalf of Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Parent
Indemnified Party).

  

  

(c) If the Equityholders' Representative in good faith objects to any claim
made by Parent in any Officer's Claim Certificate, then the Equityholders'
Representative shall deliver a written notice (a "Claim Dispute Notice") to
Parent during the thirty (30) day period commencing upon receipt by the
Equityholders' Representative of the Officer's Claim Certificate (such period,
the "Claim Response Period"). The Claim Dispute Notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the dispute of any claim made by Parent in the
Officer's Claim Certificate. If the Equityholders' Representative does not
deliver a Claim Dispute Notice to Parent prior to the expiration of such
thirty (30) day period, then (i) each claim for indemnification set forth in
such Officer's Claim Certificate shall be deemed to have been conclusively
determined in Parent's favor for purposes of this Article IX on the terms set
forth in the Officer's Claim Certificate and (ii) if cash remains in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, then Parent may direct the Escrow Agent to deliver cash
from the Escrow Fund to Parent in accordance with this Section 9.4 and the
Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(d) If the Equityholders' Representative delivers a Claim Dispute Notice
within the Claim Response Period, then Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections
raised by the Equityholders' Representative in such Claim Dispute Notice. If
Parent and the Equityholders' Representative agree to a resolution of such
objection, then a memorandum setting forth the matters conclusively determined
by Parent and the Equityholders' Representative shall be prepared and signed
by both parties and, if cash remains in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, promptly
delivered to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to distribute cash
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such
memorandum.

  

  

(e) If no such resolution can be reached during the forty-five (45) day period
following Parent's receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then upon the
expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, either Parent or the
Equityholders' Representative may bring suit to resolve the objection in
accordance with Sections 10.12 and 10.13. Upon any such resolution, Parent and
the Equityholders' Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent to
act in accordance with such decision and distribute cash from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.

  

  

SECTION 9.5 Defense of Third-Party Claims.

  

  

(a) Upon receipt by any Parent Indemnified Party seeking to be indemnified
pursuant to Section 9.2 of notice of any actual claim, demand, suit, action,
arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding that has been brought or
asserted by a third party against such Parent Indemnified Party and that may
be subject to indemnification hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Parent
Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver an Officer's Claim Certificate to the
Equityholders' Representative indicating the nature of such Third-Party Claim
and the stated basis therefor and the amount of Damages claimed pursuant to
such Third-Party Claim, to the extent known.

  

  

(b) (i) The Equityholders' Representative shall have ten (10) days after
receipt of the Officer's Claim Certificate notice of a given Third-Party Claim
to elect, at its

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

option, to assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim if the
Equityholders' Representative (A) acknowledges that the Damages resulting from
such Third-Party Claim are Damages for which the Equityholders must indemnify
or hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2 and (B)
furnishes the Parent Indemnified Party with evidence that the Equityholders
have adequate resources to defend the Third-Party Claim; provided that the
Equityholders' Representative shall not be entitled to assume or maintain
control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim if (1) the Third-Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Action, (2) the Third
Party Claims seeks an injunction or equitable relief for other than monetary
damages against any Parent Indemnified Party, (3) the Equityholders have
failed or are failing to prosecute or defend vigorously the Third-Party Claim
or (4) the amount of the Third-Party Claim, if determined in favor of the
claimant, would reasonably be expected to result in Damages, together with all
other then-outstanding claims for indemnification hereunder, that would exceed
the remaining available amount in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. (ii) If the
Equityholders' Representative assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim: (A)
the attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees and court or
arbitration costs incurred by the Equityholders' Representative in connection
with defending such Third-Party Claim shall be payable by the Equityholders,
(B) the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to monitor and participate
in such defense at its sole expense (except as provided in the following
sentence), (C) the Parent Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Equityholders' Representative all books, records and other documents and
materials of any Acquired Company that the Equityholders' Representative
reasonably considers necessary or desirable for the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, (D) the Parent Indemnified Party shall otherwise cooperate in
good faith as reasonably requested by the Equityholders' Representative in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, (E) the Parent Indemnified Party shall not
admit any Liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim, (F) the
Equityholders' Representative shall not enter into any agreement providing for
the settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim or the consent to the
entry of a judgment with respect to such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of Parent Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (G) the Parent Indemnified
Party shall not enter into any agreement providing for the settlement or
compromise of such Third-Party Claim or the consent to the entry of a judgment
with respect to such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
Equityholders' Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). (iii) The Parent Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel in such Third-Party Claim and
participate in such defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Parent Indemnified Party, provided, however,
that the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Equityholders'
cost, risk and expense, to retain one firm of separate counsel of its own
choosing (along with any required local counsel) if (w) the Equityholders'
Representative and the Parent Indemnified Party so mutually agree, (x) the
Equityholders' Representative fails within a reasonable time to retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Indemnified Party, (y) the Parent
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those
available to the Equityholders or (z) the named parties in any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Equityholders and the
Parent Indemnified Party and representation of both sets of parties by the
same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them.

  

  

SECTION 9.6 Subrogation. To the extent that a Parent Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, the Equityholders'
Representative shall be entitled (on behalf of the Equityholders) to exercise,
and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of
indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that the
Parent Indemnified Party or any of the Parent Indemnified Party's Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates may have against any other Person with respect to any
Damages, circumstances or

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

matter to which such indemnification is directly or indirectly related. The
Parent Indemnified Party shall take such actions as the Equityholders'
Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the
Equityholders' Representative to perfect or exercise the right of subrogation
of the Equityholders' Representative under this Section 9.6.

  

  

SECTION 9.7 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. The parties agree
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article IX shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price unless
otherwise required by Law.

  

  

ARTICLE X.

  

GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

SECTION 10.1 Equityholders' Representative.

  

  

(a) Appointment. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders, and without further action of any Company stockholder, each
Equityholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted and appointed
Shareholder Representative Services LLC (and by execution of this Agreement it
hereby accepts such appointment) to act as the Equityholders' Representative
and as the sole agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the
Equityholders (in their capacity as such), with full power of substitution, to
act in the name, place and stead of each Equityholder with respect to Article
II, Article III, Article IX and the Escrow Agreement and the taking by the
Equityholders' Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Equityholders'
Representative under Article II, Article III, Article IX and the Escrow
Agreement and to accept on behalf of each Equityholder service of process and
any notices required to be served on the Equityholders. The power of attorney
granted in this Section 10.1(a) is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable, may be delegated by the Equityholders' Representative and shall
survive the death or incapacity of each Equityholder. Such agency may be
changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund from time
to time (including in the event of the death, disability or other incapacity
of an Equityholders' Representative that is an individual), and any such
successor shall succeed the Equityholders' Representative as Equityholders'
Representative hereunder. Neither the removal of, nor the appointment of a
successor, Equityholders' Representative shall affect in any manner the
validity or enforceability of any actions taken or agreements, understandings
or commitments entered into by the prior Equityholders' Representative, which
shall continue to be effective and binding on the Equityholders. For the
avoidance of doubt, any compromise or settlement of any matter by the
Equityholders' Representative hereunder shall be binding on, and fully
enforceable against, all Equityholders. No bond shall be required of the
Equityholders' Representative.

  

  

(b) Limitation on Liability. The Equityholders' Representative (in its
capacity as such) shall not be liable to any Person for any act of the
Equityholders' Representative taken in good faith and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (it being understood that any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence
of such good faith), except to the extent any Liability, loss, damage,
penalty, fine, cost or expense is actually incurred by such Person as a result
of the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Equityholders'
Representative. The Equityholders' Representative shall not be liable for, and
shall be indemnified by the Equityholders for, and to the extent available
shall be entitled to draw against the Equityholders' Representative Fund at
any time and from time to time for, any Liability, loss, damage, penalty,
fine, cost or expense ("Representative Losses") incurred by the Equityholders'
Representative while acting in good faith and arising out of or in connection

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent that any such Liability, loss,
damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense is the proximate result of the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Equityholders'
Representative. If not paid directly to the Equityholders' Representative by
the Equityholders or satisfied by the funds in the Equityholders'
Representative Fund, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Equityholders' Representative from (i) the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund otherwise distributable to the Equityholders pursuant to the terms hereof
and the Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with
written instructions delivered by the Equityholders' Representative to the
Escrow Agent and (ii) any Milestone Payments actually payable to the
Equityholders; provided that while this Section 10.1(b) allows the
Equityholders' Representative to be paid from the Escrow Fund and the
Milestone Payments, this Section 10.1(b) shall not relieve the Equityholders
from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as such
Representative Losses are suffered or incurred, nor shall it prevent the
Equityholders' Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law
or otherwise. The Equityholders' Representative shall be permitted, in its
sole discretion, to engage a third-party payment agent for the purposes of the
distributing funds to the Equityholders as required by this Agreement and
shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Equityholders for the costs thereof,
including by utilizing funds from the Equityholders' Representative Fund. The
Equityholders' Representative shall be the administrator of the Equityholders'
Representative Fund and shall have authority to draw against the
Equityholders' Representative Fund in accordance with the preceding sentences
of this Section 10.1(b).

  

  

(c) Access. Subject to the provisions of Sections 2.9(c), 2.9(d) and 2.9(e),
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the Equityholders' Representative with reasonable
access to information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable
assistance of the officers and employees of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights
under this Agreement, provided, that the Equityholders' Representative shall
treat confidentially any nonpublic information about the Surviving
Corporation; provided that the foregoing shall not prevent the Equityholders'
Representative from disclosing such information to enforce any rights or
defend any claims hereunder so long as such disclosure is relevant to the
enforcement of such rights or defense of such claims and is only disclosed in
formal proceedings related thereto and provided that the Equityholders'
Representative shall give Parent as much notice thereof as reasonably
practicable, makes reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of such
information and discloses no more than is legally required. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Equityholders' Representative
may disclose information (x) to the extent required by Law, (y) to Permitted
Recipients who are bound by obligations of confidentiality with respect to
such information that are at least as restricted as those imposed on Permitted
Recipients pursuant to Section 2.9(e) and (z) to employees, advisors or
consultants of the Equityholders' Representative, in the case of the foregoing
clauses (y) and (z), who have a need to know such information; provided that
(i) each such Person referred to in clause (z) is informed of the confidential
nature of such information and is bound by obligations of confidentiality to
the Equityholders' Representative and (ii) the Equityholders' Representative
shall be responsible for the action by any such Person that would constitute a
breach of this Section 10.1(c) if taken by the Equityholders' Representative.

  

  

(d) Actions of the Equityholders' Representative. From and after the Effective
Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholders'
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Equityholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each Equityholder, and the Escrow Agent and
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Equityholders' Representatives on all matters relating to this Agreement and

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Escrow Agreement, and may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Equityholders' Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each Equityholder. The Parent Indemnified Parties
are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them
in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders' Representative.

(iv) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Equityholders'

its obligations hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement do not and will not

market, or any listing authority including the U.K. Listing Authority, no
party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise

SECTION 10.6 Interpretation. The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement. References to Articles, Sections, Schedules or Exhibits in this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, are references to Articles, Sections,
Schedules and Exhibits of or to this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with
respect to any term or provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties to this Agreement, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
to this Agreement by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, county,
local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. For
all purposes of and under this Agreement, (a) the word "including" shall be
deemed to be immediately followed by the words "without limitation," (b) words
(including defined terms) in the singular shall be deemed to include the
plural and vice versa, (c) words of one gender shall be deemed to include the
other gender as the context requires, (d) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereto," "herewith" and any other words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the other Schedules and Exhibits
to this Agreement) and not to any particular term or provision of this
Agreement, unless otherwise specified and (e) unless otherwise defined in this
Agreement, accounting terms shall have the respective meanings assigned to
them in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 10.7 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the terms or
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other certificate, instrument
or other document referred to in this Agreement, shall, for any reason, be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or any other such certificate, instrument or other document
referred to in this Agreement, and the parties to this Agreement shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute one or more valid, legal
and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement which, insofar as
practicable, implement the purposes and intent of this Agreement. Any term or
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part, degree
or within certain jurisdictions shall remain in full force and effect to the
extent not held invalid or unenforceable to the extent consistent with the
intent of the parties as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, each party waives any term or provision of Law which
renders any term or provision of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect.

  

  

SECTION 10.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the other Schedules and the Exhibits to this Agreement)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 10.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties to
this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties to this Agreement, and any purported
assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void and
unenforceable, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (a) one or more of their respective Affiliates at any time and (b)
after the Effective Time, to any Person; provided, that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder
or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns.

  

  

SECTION 10.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement, except for (a) the Company Indemnified Parties
under Section 6.7, (b) the Parent Indemnified Parties under Article IX and (c)
the Company on behalf of the Equityholders to pursue damages (including claims
for damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transaction to the
Equityholders) in the event of Parent's or Merger Sub's breach of this
Agreement prior to the Closing Date (whether or not the Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to Article VIII), which right is hereby expressly
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub. The third-party beneficiary
rights referenced in clause (c) of the preceding sentence may be exercised
only by the Company (on behalf of the Equityholders as their agent) through
actions expressly approved by the Company's Board of Directors, and no
Equityholder whether purporting to act in its capacity as a Equityholder or
purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the
Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause the exercise of
any such right.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 10.11 Waivers and Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written instrument executed by all of the parties to this
Agreement. Any failure of the parties to this Agreement to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be waived
by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument
signed by the party granting such waiver. No delay on the part of any party to
this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party to
this Agreement of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided, the rights and remedies
provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which the parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at
law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on
behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this Section 10.11.

  

  

SECTION 10.12 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within such State. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the
United States of America sitting within the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, the agreements delivered in connection with
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees
not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (b)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by
Law, in such Federal court, (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or
Federal court and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably consents to service of process in
the manner provided for notices in Section 10.4. Nothing in this Agreement
shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 10.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF SUCH WAIVERS, (c) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (d) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.13.

  

  

SECTION 10.14 Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties. It is the
explicit intent and understanding of each of the parties to this Agreement
that no party to this Agreement, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
representatives or agents, is making any representation or warranty
whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, other than those set forth in
this Agreement (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule), and none of
the parties to this Agreement is relying on any statement, representation or
warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by another party to this
Agreement or such other party's Affiliates, representatives or agents, except
for the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 10.15 Equitable Remedies. Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be
irreparably damaged in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that the other parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to obtain an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
such first party under this Agreement, and each party to this Agreement hereby
agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties to this
Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition, legal
or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance as a
remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in
connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in
this Section 10.15 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies at law or in equity that the parties to this Agreement may elect to
pursue.

  

  

SECTION 10.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
