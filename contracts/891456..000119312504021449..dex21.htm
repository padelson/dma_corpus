v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this _"Agreement"_ ) dated February 12,
2004, by and among Plains Exploration and Production Company, a Delaware
corporation ( _"Parent"_ ), PXP California Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ( _"Merger Sub,"_ and, together with
Parent, the _"Parent Parties"_ ) and Nuevo Energy Company, a Delaware
corporation ( _"Target"_ ).



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Target deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations
and stockholders that Target merge with and into Parent (the _"Merger"_ )
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and such Boards
of Directors have approved the Agreement and the Merger; and



WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the _"Code"_ );



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:



ARTICLE I

 



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, at the Effective Time Target shall merge with and into Parent and the
separate corporate existence of Target shall thereupon cease and Parent shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as
the _"Surviving Corporation"_ ). The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 259 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the _"DGCL"_ ),
including the Surviving Corporations succession to and assumption of all
rights and obligations of Target.



1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger._ The Merger shall become effective
(the _"Effective Time"_ ) upon the later of (i) the date of filing of
a properly executed Certificate of Merger relating to the Merger with the
Secretary of State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, and (ii) at such
later time as the parties shall agree and set forth in such Certificate of
Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger referred to above shall be
made as soon as practicable on the Closing Date set forth in _Section 3.5_.



1.3 _Tax Treatment._ It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.



ARTICLE II



THE SURVIVING CORPORATION



2.1 _Certificate of Incorporation._ The Certificate of Incorporation
of Parent in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving



 

1 Corporation at and after the Effective Time until thereafter amended in
accordance with the terms thereof and the DGCL. 



2.2 _Bylaws._ The bylaws of Parent as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at and
after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended in accordance with
their terms and as provided by the Surviving Corporations Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws and the DGCL.



2.3 _Directors and Officers._ At and after the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of Parent shall be the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws and the DGCL. This _Section 2.3_ shall not alter
Parents obligations under _Section 7.12_.



ARTICLE III



CONVERSION OF SHARES



3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital
stock described below:





(a) All shares of Common Stock of Target, par value $.01 per share (
_"Target Common Shares"_ ), that are held in Targets treasury shall be
canceled and cease to be outstanding and no cash, Parent capital stock or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(b) Subject to _Section 3.3(a)_ , each issued and outstanding Target
Common Share (other than Target Common Shares treated in accordance with
_Section 3.1(a)_ ) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.765 (the
_"Exchange Ratio"_ ) shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
Parent (the _"Parent Common Shares"_ ) (the _"Common Conversion
Consideration"_ ). All such Target Common Shares, when so converted, shall be
retired, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled,
and the holder of a certificate ( _"Stock Certificate"_ ) that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented such Target Common Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon
the surrender of such Stock Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.2_ : (x)
the Common Conversion Consideration, (y) certain dividends and other
distributions under _Section 3.1(f)_ , and (z) cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Shares under _Section 3.4_ , in each case without interest
(collectively, the _"Merger Consideration"_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if between the date hereof and the Effective Time the Parent Common Shares or
Target Common Shares are changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, because of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange
Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares.





(c) Under and in accordance with the terms set forth in the TECONS
Documents, the right to receive Target Common Shares upon the conversion of
and under the



 

2 terms of Targets Debentures issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the related right to receive Target Common Shares upon
the conversion of and under the terms of the TECONS issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such conversion occurring by way of
the exchange of such TECONS for Debentures and thereupon the conversion of
such Debentures into Target Common Shares), shall each become the right to
receive only Parent Common Shares (and not any Target Common Shares) and the
conversion price per Target Common Share of such securities shall be adjusted
to a conversion price per Parent Common Share equal to the quotient of (x)
the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which
shall be $59.375) divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio.



For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the _"Base Indenture"_ means the
Subordinated Indenture dated as of November 25, 1996, as amended by the First
Supplemental Indenture dated December 23, 1996, between Nuevo Energy Company
and Wilmington Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee (the  _"Supplemental
Indenture"_ and, together with the Base Indenture, the _"5.75% Indenture"_ );
(ii) the _"Declaration of Trust"_ means the Amended and Restated Declaration
of Trust dated December 23, 1996, among Nuevo Energy Company, as Sponsor,
Wilmington Trust Company, as Institutional Trustee and Delaware Trustee, and
Michael D. Watford, Robert L. Gerry, III and Robert M. King, as Regular
Trustees; (iii) the  _"Debentures"_ means Targets 5.75% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due December 15, 2026 issued under the 5.75%
Indenture; (iv) _"TECONS"_ means the $2.875 Term Convertible Securities,
Series A, issued under the Declaration of Trust; (v) _"Guarantee"_ means the
Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement dated as of December 23, 1996,
executed and delivered by Target, as Guarantor, and Wilmington Trust Company,
as the Preferred Guarantee Trustee; and (vi) the _"TECONS Documents"_ means
the Declaration of Trust, the 5.75% Indenture, the Debentures, the TECONS and
the Guarantee.





(d) [Intentionally Deleted.]





(e) The Merger shall not affect any Parent Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.





(f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Stock
Certificate with respect to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to a holder pursuant to _Section 3.4_ until the holder of record of such
Stock Certificate has surrendered such Stock Certificate in accordance with
_Section 3.2_. Subject to the effect of applicable laws (including
escheat and abandoned property laws), following surrender of any such Stock
Certificate, the record holder of the certificate or certificates representing
the Merger Consideration issued in exchange therefor shall be paid, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to Parent
Common Shares, and (ii) if the payment date for any dividend or distribution
with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Shares has not occurred prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate, at
the appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate
and a payment date subsequent to the surrender of such Stock Certificate.



 

3 (g) All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Stock Certificates and the Target Common Shares formerly represented thereby,
and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
of Target Common Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.



3.2 _Surrender and Payment._





(a) Parent shall authorize one or more transfer agent(s) reasonably
acceptable to Target to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the _"Exchange
Agent"_ ) with respect to the Merger. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Target Common Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Section 3.2_
through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the Parent Common Shares
issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ in exchange for outstanding Target Common
Shares plus accrued and unpaid dividends with respect thereto (such Parent
Common Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares, being hereinafter
referred to as the _"Exchange Fund"_ ). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration in exchange for
surrendered Stock Certificates pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by _Section 3.2(d)_ , the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.



(b) Promptly but in any event within 5 business days after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record
of Stock Certificates a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
with respect to the Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a
form reasonably acceptable to Target), and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Stock Certificates for payment therefor in accordance
herewith (together, the _"Exchange Instructions"_ ). The Exchange Agent shall
also provide for holders of Stock Certificates to procure in person
immediately after the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
and to deliver in person immediately after the Effective Time such letter of
transmittal and Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be issued or paid to a
Person other than the registered holder of Target Common Shares represented by
the Stock Certificate(s) surrendered in exchange therefor, no such issuance
or payment shall be made unless (i) the Stock Certificate(s) so surrendered
have been properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
(ii) the Person requesting such issuance has paid to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such issuance to a Person
other than the registered holder or establish to the Exchange Agents
satisfaction that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. For this
Agreement,  _"Person"_ means an individual, a corporation, a limited
liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity
or organization, including any governmental or regulatory authority or agency
(a  _"GovernmentalAuthority"_ ).



 

4 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Target Common Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holders
Stock Certificates in accordance with this _Section 3.2_ prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent, as a general creditor thereof, to
exchange such Stock Certificates or to pay amounts to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1_. If outstanding Stock Certificates are
not surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or, in any
particular case, prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
issuable or payable upon the surrender of such Stock Certificates would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or
agency), the Merger Consideration issuable or payable upon the surrender of
such Stock Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, Target or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
Stock Certificates for any amount paid, or Merger Consideration delivered, to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.



(e) If any Stock Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate is
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 



3.3 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock._





(a) At least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, Target shall
give each holder of any employee or director stock option of Target (the
_"Target Options"_ ) outstanding at the Effective Time, the opportunity to
elect to have each such Target Option, whether or not then vested, cancelled
and cashed out immediately prior to the Effective Time. The consideration for
the cancellation of any such Target Option shall be (x) the amount by which
the Target Market Price (as defined below) of one share of Target Common Share
exceeds the per share exercise price of such Target Option (y) multiplied by
the number of Target Common Shares covered by the outstanding portion of the
cancelled Target Option. Each such Target Option the holder of which has so
elected shall be cancelled and no longer be outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Target shall pay such consideration to the holders
electing to cancel their Target Options prior to the Effective Time. _"Target
Market Price"_ means the average closing sales price of a Target Common Share
as reported under "NYSE Composite Transaction Reports" in The Wall Street
Journal for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the first trading day
before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Parents election
Parent shall, in lieu of Targets above-described payments to Named
Executives, Parent may make such payments to Named Executives immediately
subsequent to the Effective Time.



For purposes of this Agreement, _"Named Executives"_ means the Chief
Executive Officer and the four other most highly compensated executive
officers of Target as of December 31, 2003.



 

5 (b) At the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, Parent will assume each outstanding Target Option
that has not been cancelled in accordance with the provisions of _Section
3.3(a)_ , and it will become an option (i) to purchase that number of Parent
Common Shares obtained by multiplying the number of Target Common Shares
issuable upon the exercise of such Target Option by the Exchange Ratio, (ii)
at an exercise price per share equal to the per share exercise price of such
Target Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, and (iii) otherwise upon the
same terms and conditions as such outstanding Target Options; except that if
Code Section 421 applies to any Target Option because of the qualifications
under Code Section 422 or 423, the exercise price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such Target Option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such Target Option will comply with Code Section 424(a).



(c) At least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, Target shall
give each holder of each outstanding and unvested employee or director
restricted Target Common Share, issued pursuant to Targets stock incentive or
other equity award plans (the " _Target Restricted Shares_ "), the opportunity
to elect to have each such Target Restricted Share, cancelled and cease to be
outstanding and cashed out immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
consideration for the cancellation of any such Target Restricted Share shall
be the Target Market Price. Each such Target Restricted Share the holder of
which has so elected shall be cancelled and no longer be outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Target shall pay such consideration
to the holders electing to cancel their Target Restricted Shares prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Parents election Parent
shall, in lieu of Targets above-described payments to Named Executives,
Parent may make such payments to Named Executives immediately subsequent to
the Effective Time



(d) At the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, Parent will assume each Target Restricted Share that
has not been cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ , and such Target
Restricted Share will become 1.765 restricted Parent Common Shares otherwise
on the same terms and conditions of vesting as such Target Restricted Shares.



 

6 (e) Parent will take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares for delivery upon
exercise of Target Options Parent assumes under ___Section 3.3(a)_ __.



(f) On or prior to the 30th day following the Effective Time, Parent will
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms) with respect to the Parent Common Shares subject to Target
Options and will use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for as long as such options
remain outstanding.



(g) Parent will assume as of the Effective Time each Target stock option
plan providing for the issuance or grant of Target Options and all of Targets
obligations with respect to the Target Options. Upon assumption of such
plans, such amendments thereto as may be required to reflect the Merger will
be deemed to have been made.



3.4 _No Fractional Shares._ No fractional Parent Common Shares shall
be issued in the Merger and fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of
any fractional interest, each holder of Target Common Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of
a Parent Common Share upon surrender of Stock Certificates for exchange
pursuant to _Section 3.2_ shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest)
as hereinafter provided. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
determine the number of whole and fractional Parent Common Shares allocable to
each holder of record of Target Common Shares at the Effective Time, to
aggregate all such fractional shares into whole shares, to sell whole shares
obtained thereby in the open market at then prevailing prices on behalf of
holders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional share interests
and to distribute to each such holder such holders ratable share of the total
proceeds of such sale, after making appropriate deductions of the amount, if
any, required for federal income tax withholding purposes and after deducting
any applicable transfer taxes. All brokers fees and commissions incurred in
connection with such sales shall be paid by Parent.



3.5 _Closing._ The closing (the _"Closing"_ ) of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the _"Transactions"_ ) shall take place at
12:00 noon, local time, on the business day (the _"Closing Date"_ ) on which
all of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ are satisfied or waived, at
the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, 1900 Pennzoil Place, South
Tower, 711 Louisiana Street, Houston, Texas 77002 (prior to March 26, 2004) or
1111 Louisiana Street, 44th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 (on or after March 26,
2004), or at such other date and time as Parent and Target shall agree.



3.6 _Alternative Structure._ Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, Parent may, at its sole discretion, elect to restructure the
Merger to provide for a merger of Merger Sub with and into Target. To exercise
this option, Parent must send notice to Target on or before 5:00 p.m. Houston,
Texas time on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date. If
Parent exercises this option, the following modifications shall automatically
result to the specified provisions of this Agreement:

the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Target
Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that no representation or warranty

upon consummation of the Merger, provide for the TECONS and the Debentures
becoming at the Effective Time convertible solely into Parent Common Shares in

4.19 _Required Stockholder Vote._ The only vote of the holders of
any class or series of Targets capital stock that shall be necessary to

the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be made therein or necessary in order to

27 service marks, service mark rights, copyrights, technology, know-how,
processes and other proprietary intellectual property rights and computer
programs ("Intellectual Property") currently used in the conduct of the
business of Target and its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to so own or
otherwise have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Target Material Adverse Effect. No
Person has notified either Target or any of its Subsidiaries in writing and
Target does not have any knowledge that their use of the
Intellectual Property infringes on the rights of any Person, subject to such
claims and infringements as do not, individually or in the aggregate, give
rise to any liability on the part of Target and its Subsidiaries that could
have a Target Material Adverse Effect, and, to Targets knowledge, no Person
is infringing on any right of Target or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any such Intellectual Property. No claims are pending or, to Targets
knowledge, threatened that Target or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing or
otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any Person with regard to any
Intellectual Property.



4.22 _Hedging._ Section 4.22 of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets
forth for the periods shown obligations of Target and each of its
Subsidiaries for the delivery of Hydrocarbons attributable to any of the
properties of Target or any of its Subsidiaries in the future on account of
prepayment, advance payment, take-or-pay or similar obligations without then
or thereafter being entitled to receive full value therefor. Except as set
forth in Section 4.22 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, as of the date
hereof, neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by

contracts that are intended to benefit from, relate to or reduce or eliminate
the risk of fluctuations in the price of commodities, including Hydrocarbons,
or securities.



4.23 _Brokers._ No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated and Randall and Dewey, Inc., the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by Target) is entitled to any brokerage,

Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made

of all agreements and engagement letters currently in effect with Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated and Randall and Dewey, Inc. (the "Target Engagement
Letters") have been provided to Parent.



4.24 _Tax-Free Reorganization._ Neither Target nor, to the knowledge
of Target, any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that
would prevent the Merger from constituting a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the

Effective Time. For this purpose, it is assumed that the fair market value of
the outstanding Target Common Shares will equal the fair market value of the
aggregate Merger Consideration.

the Merger, (i) none of the Target Common Shares will be redeemed, and (ii)
no extraordinary distribution will be made with respect to Target Common

similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

otherwise required by a "determination" (as defined in Code Section
1313(a)(1)).

or indirectly, immediately before or immediately after such purchase,
exchange, redemption, or other acquisition, at least 50% of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50% of the
total value of shares of all classes of stock, taking into account for
purposes of this clause (ii) any stock owned by 5% or greater stockholders of
Parent (or any successor) or such corporation, a proportionate share of the
stock owned by entities in which Parent (or any successor) or such corporation
owns an interest, and any stock which may be acquired pursuant to the
exercise of options.



 

30 For purposes of this section and _Section 5.24_ , " _Affiliated Group_ "
means one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership
with a common parent corporation, but only if



(x) the common parent owns directly stock that possesses at least 80% of
the total voting power, and has a value at least equal to 80% of the total
value, of the stock in at least one of the other corporations, and



(y) stock possessing at least 80% of the total voting power, and having a
value at least equal to 80% of the total value, of the stock in each
corporation (except the common parent) is owned directly by one or more of the

written opinion from Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated to the effect that, as
of the date of such opinion, the Common Conversion Consideration is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Target Common Shares.
True and complete copies of such opinion have been given to Parent for
informational purposes only, and Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated has agreed
to the inclusion of such written opinion in the Proxy/Prospectus for the
Target Meeting.



4.26 _Takeover Laws and Rights Plans._



(a) No "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other
similar antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under state or federal laws
in the United States (with the exception of Section 203 of the DGCL)
applicable to Target is applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The action of the Board of Directors of
Target in approving this Agreement (and the Transactions provided for herein)
is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement (and the Transactions
provided for herein) the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL.



(b) Target has amended its Rights Agreement dated March 5, 1997, as amended
by the Amendment to Rights Agreement dated January 10, 1999 (collectively,
the " _Target Rights Agreement_ ") to ensure that (a) a "Distribution Date"
and a "Stock Acquisition Date" (in each case as defined in the Target
Rights Agreement) will not occur, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their "Affiliates" or "Associates" will be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person"
(in each case as defined in the Target Rights Agreement), by reason of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (b) the Rights will expire immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB



 

Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to

qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in

delivered by Parent to Target contemporaneously with the execution hereof (the
"Parent Disclosure Schedule"), which include each jurisdiction in which the
character of Parents or Merger Subs properties or the nature of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except in jurisdictions, if any,
where the failure to be so qualified would not result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each Parent Party has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, use or lease its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each Parent Party
has made available to Target a complete and correct copy of its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, each as amended to date, and Parents and Merger
Subs certificate of incorporation and bylaws as made available are in full
force and effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in default in any respect
in the performance, observation or fulfillment of any provision of its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent formed solely for the purpose of effecting the Merger and
has conducted no activity and has incurred no liability or obligation other
than as contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) Section 5.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists the name and
jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger
Sub) and the jurisdictions in which each such Subsidiary is qualified or
holds licenses to do business as a foreign corporation or other organization
as of the date hereof. Each of Parents Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in the jurisdictions listed in Section
5.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, which includes each jurisdiction in
which the character of such Subsidiarys properties or the nature of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except in jurisdictions, if any,
where the failure to be so qualified would not result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Parents Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own, use or lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and as it is now proposed to be
conducted. Parent has made available to Target a complete and correct copy of

documents) of each of Parents Subsidiaries, each as amended to date, and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents)
as made available are in full force and effect. No Subsidiary of Parent is in
default in any respect in the performance, observation or fulfillment of any
provision of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents). Other than Parents Subsidiaries, Parent does not
beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, 5% or



 

32 more of any class of equity or similar securities of any corporation or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated.

in or have) a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business,
assets, properties or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; provided that, in no event shall any of the following be
deemed to constitute or be taken into account in determining a Parent Material
Adverse Effect: any event, circumstance, change or effect that results from

of oil or natural gas, (iii) the public announcement or pending nature of the
Transactions, (iv) compliance with the terms of this Agreement, or (v) change
in the price of the Target Common Shares or the Parent Common Shares.

Shares issued and outstanding, (ii) 17,192 Parent Common Shares in treasury,
(iii) no shares of preferred stock outstanding (iv) no outstanding stock
options to acquire Parent Common Shares under any stock option plans or

or outstanding having the right to vote with Parents stockholders, whether
together or as a separate class, on any matters on which Parents stockholders
may vote. All the outstanding Parent Common Shares are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth
above, and other than this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, rights, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation rights,
phantom equity, or other agreements or commitments (including "rights plans"
or "poison pills") obligating Parent to issue, transfer, sell, redeem,
repurchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock of any class.
There are no agreements, arrangements or other understandings to which Parent
is a party with respect to the right to vote any shares of capital stock of
Parent.

Schedule, Parent is, directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner
of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Parent Subsidiary,
there are no irrevocable proxies with respect to any such shares, and no
equity securities of any Parent Subsidiary are or may become required to be

commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or
rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of any
capital stock of any Parent Subsidiary, and there are no contracts,
commitments, understandings or arrangements by which Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary is or may be bound to issue additional shares of capital stock of
any Parent Subsidiary or securities convertible into or exchangeable or

Parent Disclosure Schedule, all of such shares Parent owns are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by it free and clear of all
Liens.

incorporated by reference in certain of such reports, required to be filed by
it with the SEC since November 8, 2002 under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports"). As of the respective

received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such
certification. Parent maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as

and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information
concerning Parent and its subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for preparing Parents SEC filings and other public
disclosure and Parent is otherwise in substantial compliance with all
applicable effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable

Subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(contingent or otherwise) that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of
Parent and its Subsidiaries or the notes thereto which are not reflected.

change in GAAP or to conform a Subsidiarys accounting policies and practices
to those of Parent.



 

36 5.9 _Taxes_. Except as otherwise disclosed in Section 5.9 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and for matters that would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect:

timely filed on their behalf) or will file or cause to be timely filed, all
material Tax Returns required by applicable law to be filed by any of them
prior to or as of the Closing Date. As of the time of filing, the foregoing
Tax Returns correctly reflected the material facts regarding the income,
business, assets, operations, activities, status, or other matters of Parent
or any other information required to be shown thereon. In particular, the
foregoing tax returns are not subject to penalties under Section 6662 of the
Code, relating to accuracy related penalties (or any corresponding provision
of the state, local or foregoing Tax law) or any predecessor provision of law.
An extension of time within which to file a Tax Return that has not been filed

adequate accrual for the payment of all material Taxes (as defined below) due

any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third
party.



(c) No Audit by a Tax Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened with respect to any Tax Returns filed by, or Taxes due from, Parent
or any Subsidiary. No issue has been raised by any Tax Authority in any Audit
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that if raised with respect to any other
period not so audited could be expected to result in a material proposed
deficiency for any period not so audited. No material deficiency or adjustment
for any Taxes has been proposed, asserted, assessed, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
liens for Taxes upon the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except

contract or otherwise.



(i) None of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has a liability for
Taxes of any Person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) under
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or

(j) Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has distributed stock of
another person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a
transaction that also purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Code Sections 355 and 1611. Any transaction described in Section 5.9 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule that were purported or intended to be governed

pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened against or directly affecting
Parent, any Subsidiaries of Parent or any of the directors or officers of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in their capacity as such, nor is there any
reasonable basis therefor that could reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, if adversely determined. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any officer, director or employee of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, has been permanently or temporarily enjoined by any order,
judgment or decree of any court or any other Governmental Authority from
engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the
business, assets or properties of Parent or such Subsidiary, nor, to the

employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under investigation by any
Governmental Authority. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed
and publicly available prior to the date hereof or Section 5.10 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, there is no order, judgment or decree of any court or
other tribunal or other agency extant enjoining or requiring Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action of any kind with respect to its

in _Section 5.12_.

each such plan has been administered in substantial compliance with its
terms and applicable law, except for any noncompliance with respect to any
such plan that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect; (iii) neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has
engaged in, and Parent and each Parent ERISA Affiliate do not have any
knowledge of any Person that has engaged in, any transaction or acted or
failed to act in any manner that would subject Parent or any Parent ERISA
Affiliate to any liability for a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA that
could reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
(iv) no disputes are pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or any Parent
ERISA Affiliate, threatened; (v) neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate
has engaged in, and Parent and each Parent ERISA Affiliate do not have any

exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code or
Section 4975(d) of the Code that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; (vi) there have been no "reportable events"

of intent to terminate such plan has been given under Section 4041 of ERISA
and no proceeding has been instituted under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate

for benefits other than benefits accrued to the date of such termination. All
contributions made or required to be made under any Parent Benefit Plan meet
the requirements for deductibility under the Code, and all contributions which
are required and which have not been made have been properly recorded on the
books of Parent or a Parent ERISA Affiliate.

Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning
of Section 413(c) of the Code). No event has occurred with respect to Parent
or a Parent ERISA Affiliate in connection with which Parent could be subject
to any liability, lien or encumbrance with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan

class or series of Parents capital stock that shall be necessary to
consummate the Transactions is (a) the approval by a majority of the votes
cast by the holders of the Parent Common Shares (provided that the total vote
cast represents over 50% in interest of all securities entitled to vote on
such proposal) of the issuance of Parent Common Shares to the holders of
Target Common Shares as a result of the Transactions, and (b) the adoption of
this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
Parent Common Shares (collectively, the " _Parent Stockholders  Approval_").



5.20 _Proxy/Prospectus; Registration Statement_. None of the
information to be supplied by Parent for inclusion in (a) the Proxy/Prospectus
to be filed by Target and Parent with the SEC, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, or (b) the Registration Statement to be filed by Parent
with the SEC in connection with the Merger, and any amendments or supplements
thereto, will, at the respective times such documents are filed, and, in the
case of the Proxy/Prospectus, at the time the Proxy/Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to the Target and Parent
stockholders, at the time of the Target Meeting and the Parent Meeting and at
the Effective Time, and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be made therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



5.21 _Intellectual Property_. Parent or its Subsidiaries own, or are
licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all Intellectual Property
currently used in the conduct of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
except where the failure to so own or otherwise have the right to use such
Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. No Person has notified either Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries in writing and Parent does not have any knowledge that their
use of the Intellectual Property infringes on the rights of any
Person, subject to such claims and infringements as do not, individually or
in the aggregate, give rise to any liability on the part of Parent and its
Subsidiaries that could have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and, to
Parents knowledge, no Person is infringing on any right of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any such Intellectual Property. No claims are



 

44 pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any
Person with regard to any Intellectual Property.



5.22 _Hedging_. Section 5.22 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets
forth for the periods shown obligations of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
for the delivery of Hydrocarbons attributable to any of the properties of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in the future on account of prepayment,
advance payment, take-or-pay or similar obligations without then or thereafter
being entitled to receive full value therefor. Except as set forth in Section
5.22 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by futures, hedge, swap, collar, put,
call, floor, cap, option or other contracts that are intended to benefit
from, relate to or reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the price
of commodities, including Hydrocarbons, or securities.



5.23 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
JPMorgan Securities, Inc. the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
Parent) is entitled to any brokerage, finders fee or other fee or commission
payable by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries. True and correct copies of all agreements and engagement
letters currently in effect with JPMorgan Securities, Inc. (the " _Parent
Engagement Letters_ ") have been provided to Target. 



5.24 _Tax Matters_. Neither Parent nor, to the knowledge of Parent,
any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would
prevent the Merger from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:



(a) The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and there are no other written or oral
agreements relating to the Merger other than those expressly referred to in
this Agreement.



(b) In connection with the Merger, no Target Common Shares will be acquired
by Parent or a Related Person for consideration other than Parent Common
Shares, payments to the dissenting stockholders, if any, and any cash
received in lieu of fractional share interests in Parent Common Shares.



(c) The fair market value of Parent Common Shares and cash received by each
holder of Target Common Shares in connection with the Merger will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of the Target Common Shares
surrendered in the exchange.



(d) To the knowledge of Parent, Parent does not have nor does any Related
Person (as defined below) have any plan or intention to redeem or otherwise
reacquire, directly or indirectly, any Parent Common Shares to be issued in
the Merger.



(e) Parent has no stock repurchase program and has no current plan or
intention to adopt such a plan.



(f) To the knowledge of Parent, the aggregate fair market value, determined
at the Effective Time, of the Parent Common Shares to be received in the
Merger will not be less





 

45 than fifty percent (50%) of the value, determined at the Effective Time, of
the Target Common Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time.
For this purpose, it is assumed that the fair market value of the outstanding
Target Common Shares will equal the fair market value of the aggregate Merger
Consideration.



(g) Neither Parent nor any Related Person owns, nor has it owned during
the past five years, any shares of stock of the Target. Neither Parent nor any
Related Person has caused any other person to acquire stock of the Target on
behalf of Parent or a Related Person, and will not directly or indirectly
acquire any stock of the Target in connection with the Merger, except as
described in the Merger Agreement.



(h) Parent has not, directly or indirectly, transferred any cash or
property to the Target (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by
the Target) for less than full and adequate consideration and has not made any
loan to the Target (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by the
Target) in anticipation of the Merger.



(i) There is no intercompany indebtedness existing between Parent and
Target that was or will be issued, acquired, or settled at a discount in
connection with the Merger.



(j) Parent will pay its expenses incurred in connection with or as part of
the Merger or related transactions. Parent has not paid and will not pay,
directly or indirectly, any expenses (including transfer taxes) incurred by
any holder of Target Common Shares in connection with or as part of the Merger
or any related transactions. Parent has not agreed to assume, nor will it
directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed
or contingent, of any holder of Target Common Shares.



(k) To the knowledge of Parent, any compensation paid to the holders of
Target Common Shares who enter (or have entered) into employment, consulting
or noncompetitive contracts, if any, with Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(a) will be for services actually rendered or to be rendered, (b) will be
commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arms length
for similar services, and (c) will not represent consideration for the
surrender of the Target Common Shares in the Merger.



(l) Following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will continue the
historic business of Target or use a significant portion of its assets in a
business, within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.368-1(d).



(m) Parent has no plan or intention to liquidate, sell or otherwise dispose
of any of the assets of Target except for dispositions made in the ordinary
course of business or transfers or successive transfers to one or more
corporations controlled.



(n) Parent is paying no consideration for the Target stock other than the
Merger Consideration.



(o) Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by Target, and will not
transfer to Target any assets subject to liabilities, in the Merger.





 

46 (p) Parent is not an investment company within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(2)(F) of the Code. An investment company is (1) a regulated investment
company; (2) a real estate investment trust; or (3) a corporation (i) fifty
percent (50%) or more of the value of whose total assets are stock and
securities, and (ii) eighty percent (80%) or more of the value of whose total
assets are held for investment. For this purpose, "total assets" shall not
include cash and cash items (including receivables) and government securities.



(q) Parent has substantial non-tax business purposes and reasons for the
Merger, and the terms of the Merger are the product of arms length
negotiations.



(r) Parent will not take any position on any federal, state or local income
or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position that is
inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required by a
"determination" (as defined in Code Section 1313(a)(1)).



(s) No stock or securities of Parent will be issued to any Target
stockholder for services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent or the
Target in connection with the Merger.



(t) To the knowledge of Parent, no stock or securities of the Target will
be issued to any Target stockholder for services rendered to or for the
benefit of Parent or the Target in connection with the Merger.



(u) No stock or securities of Parent will be issued for any indebtedness
owed to any Target stockholder in connection with the Merger.



(v) To the knowledge of Parent, no stock or securities of the Target will
be issued for any indebtedness owed to any Target stockholder in connection
with the Merger.



5.25 _Fairness Opinion_. Parents Board of Directors has received a
written opinion from JPMorgan Securities, Inc. to the effect that, as of the
date of such opinion, the Common Conversion Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of the Parent Common Shares. True and
complete copies of such opinion have been given to Target for informational
purposes only, and JPMorgan Securities, Inc. has agreed to the inclusion of
such written opinion in the Proxy/Prospectus for the Parent Meeting.



5.26 _Takeover Laws and Rights Plans_. No "fair price", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or
regulation enacted under state or federal laws in the United States (with the
exception of Section 203 of the DGCL) applicable to Parent is applicable to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The action of the
Board of Directors of Parent in approving this Agreement (and the
Transactions provided for herein) is sufficient to render inapplicable to this
Agreement (and the Transactions provided for herein) the restrictions on
"business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth
in Section 203 of the DGCL.

during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time
to all of its books, records, properties, contracts, leases, plants and
personnel and, during such period, each shall furnish promptly to the other
(a) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by it
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws, and (b) all
other information as such other party reasonably may request, provided that
no investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ shall affect any
representations or warranties made herein or the conditions to the obligations
of the respective parties to consummate the Merger. Each party shall hold in
confidence all nonpublic information until such time as such information is
otherwise publicly available and, if this Agreement is terminated, each party
will deliver to the other all documents, work papers and other materials
(including copies) obtained by such party or on its behalf from the other
party as a result of this Agreement or in connection herewith, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of the two Confidentiality Agreements dated January 26, 2004 between
Parent and Target (the _"Confidentiality Agreements"_ ) shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.



_7.2 Acquisition Proposals. _



(a) From the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement, Target
and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys or other agents not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to solicit, initiate or encourage
any Target Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Target
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to a Target
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to Target or
its Subsidiaries, respectively, or furnish to any Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with a Target Acquisition
Proposal. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall prohibit Target and
its Board of Directors from (x) taking and disclosing a position with respect
to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act, (y) waiving, or agreeing to waive, any provision of any
stand-still or similar agreement in effect on the date hereof to allow a
Person to make a Target Acquisition Proposal, so long as simultaneously with
such waiver, such parties become subject to stand-still provisions at least
as restrictive as those in the Confidentiality Agreements, or (z) prior to
obtaining the Target Stockholders Approval, furnishing information, including
nonpublic information to, or entering into negotiations with, any Person that
has submitted an unsolicited bona fide written Target Acquisition Proposal
made not in violation of this Agreement or any standstill agreement if, and
only to the extent that (with respect to this  _Section 7.2(a)_ only):



 

53 i. such unsolicited bona fide written Target Acquisition Proposal is made
by a third party that Targets Board of Directors determines in good faith has
the good faith intent to proceed with negotiations to consider, and the
financial and legal capability to consummate, such Target Acquisition
Proposal, 



ii. Targets Board of Directors, after duly consulting with Targets
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is necessary
for Targets Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties imposed by
applicable law, 



iii. contemporaneously with furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions with, such Person, Target enters into a confidentiality
agreement with such Person on terms no less restrictive than those in the
Confidentiality Agreements,



iv. contemporaneously with furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, Target provides written
notice to Parent to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, 



v. Targets Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Target
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably capable of being completed and may
reasonably be expected to result in a transaction that is more favorable from
a financial point of view to the holders of Target Common Shares than the
Transactions, and



vi. Target uses commercially reasonable efforts to keep Parent informed in
all material respects of the status and terms of any such negotiations or
discussions (including the identity of the Person with whom such negotiations
or discussions are being held) and provides Parent copies of such written
proposals and any amendments or revisions thereto or correspondence related
thereto; provided, that Parent agrees to execute a confidentiality agreement,
in form reasonably acceptable to it, with respect to any such information
delivered to Parent pursuant to this clause (vi), which
confidentiality agreement shall be subject to Parents disclosure obligations
arising under applicable law or securities exchange regulations.



The term _"Target Acquisition Proposal"_ means any inquiry, offer or proposal
for, or any indication of interest from any Person relating to, or that is
reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, including any merger, consolidation,
tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction, of (A) assets or businesses
that constitute or represent 10% or more of the total



 

54 revenue, operating income, EBITDA or assets of Target and the Target
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 10% or more of the outstanding shares
of Target Common Shares or capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, any of the Target Subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding,
individually or taken together, the assets or business referred to in clause
(A) above, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Other than as provided in this _Section 7.2(a)_ , Target shall not
waive any provisions of a confidentiality agreement entered into with a Person
who has indicated a willingness to make an unsolicited bona fide Target
Acquisition Proposal without Parents prior written consent.



Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.2(a)_ by any officer,
director, employee, attorney, investment banker or other agent of Target or
any Target Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on
behalf of Target or any Target Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be a breach of
this _Section 7.2(a)_ by Target.



(b) From the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement, Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys or other agents not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to solicit, initiate or encourage
any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to Parent or
its Subsidiaries, respectively, or furnish to any Person any information
with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with a Parent Acquisition
Proposal. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.2(b)_ shall prohibit Parent and
its Board of Directors from (x) taking and disclosing a position with respect
to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act, (y) waiving, or agreeing to waive, any provision of any
stand-still or similar agreement in effect on the date hereof to allow a
Person to make a Parent Acquisition Proposal, so long as simultaneously with
such waiver, such parties become subject to stand-still provisions at least as
restrictive as those in the Confidentiality Agreements, or (z) prior to
obtaining the Parent Stockholders Approval, furnishing information,
including nonpublic information to, or entering into negotiations with, any
Person that has submitted an unsolicited bona fide written Parent Acquisition
Proposal made not in violation of this Agreement or any standstill agreement
if, and only to the extent that (with respect to this _Section 7.2(b)_ only):



i. such unsolicited bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal is made
by a third party that Parents Board of Directors determines in good faith
has the good faith intent to proceed with negotiations to consider, and the
financial and legal capability to consummate, such Parent Acquisition
Proposal,



ii. Parents Board of Directors, after duly consulting with Parents
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is necessary
for Parents Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties imposed by
applicable law,



 

55 iii. contemporaneously with furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions with, such Person, Parent enters into a confidentiality
agreement with such Person on terms no less restrictive than those in the
Confidentiality Agreements,



iv. contemporaneously with furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, Parent provides written
notice to Target to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person,



v. Parents Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably capable of being completed and may
reasonably be expected to result in a transaction that is more favorable from
a financial point of view to the holders of Parent Common Shares than the
Transactions, and



vi. Parent uses commercially reasonable efforts to keep Target informed in
all material respects of the status and terms of any such negotiations or
discussions (including the identity of the Person with whom such negotiations
or discussions are being held) and provides Target copies of such written
proposals and any amendments or revisions thereto or correspondence related
thereto; provided, that Target agrees to execute a confidentiality agreement,
in form reasonably acceptable to it, with respect to any such information
delivered to Target pursuant to this clause (vi), which
confidentiality agreement shall be subject to Targets disclosure obligations
arising under applicable law or securities exchange regulations.



The term " _Parent Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer or
proposal for, or any indication of interest from any Person relating to, or
that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, including any merger,
consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction, of (A) assets
or businesses that constitute or represent 10% or more of the total revenue,
operating income, EBITDA or assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (B) 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Parent
Common Shares or capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any
of the Parent Subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding, individually or
taken together, the assets or business referred to in clause (A) above, in
each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Other
than as provided in this _Section 7.2(b)_ Parent shall not waive any
provisions of a confidentiality agreement entered into with a Person who has
indicated a willingness to make an unsolicited bona fide Parent Acquisition
Proposal without Targets prior written consent.



Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.2(b)_ by any officer, director,
employee, attorney, investment banker or other



 

56 agent of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, whether or not such person is
purporting to act on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or otherwise,
shall be a breach of this _Section 7.2(b)_ by Parent.



7.3 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._



(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
an officer or director of Target, any Subsidiary or the trustee of Nuevo
Financing I, a Delaware business trust (each an " _Indemnified Party_ "), who
was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in
any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") against all losses, damages, liabilities, fees and expenses
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and experts and
judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(provided that any such settlement is effected with the prior written consent
of Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld)) actually and reasonably
incurred by the Indemnified Party because the Indemnified Party is or was a
director or officer of Target pertaining to any act or omission existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time including any act or omission
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (the " _Indemnified
Liabilities_ ") to the full extent permitted under Delaware law or the
Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws. If an
Indemnified Party makes or asserts any claim for Indemnified Liabilities, any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified
Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL shall be
made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Party; and provided, further, that nothing herein shall
impair any rights or obligations of any Indemnified Party. If any claim or
claims are brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), such Indemnified Party may select counsel for the
defense of such claim, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Target
(if selected before the Effective Time) and the Surviving Corporation (if
selected after the Effective Time).



(b) The Surviving Corporation shall promptly advance all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of each Indemnified Party in connection with any such action
or proceeding described above, as such expenses are incurred, to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL, subject to the receipt by the Surviving
Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation.



(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain Targets existing
officers and directors liability insurance policy (" _D andO Insurance"_) for
a period of at least six years after the Effective Time, but only to the
extent related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time;
provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less
advantageous to such former directors or officers; provided further, that the
aggregate amount of premiums to be paid with respect to the maintenance of
such DandO Insurance for such six-year period shall not exceed $2,000,000.



7.4 _Further Assurances_. Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents and approvals and to do all other things
necessary for the consummation of



 

57 the Transactions. The parties shall take such further action to deliver or
cause to be delivered to each other at the Closing and at such other times
thereafter as shall be reasonably agreed by such parties such additional
agreements or instruments as any of them may reasonably request for the
purpose of carrying out this Agreement and the Transactions. The
parties shall afford each other access to all information, documents, records
and personnel who may be necessary for any party to comply with laws or
regulations (including the filing and payment of taxes and handling tax
audits), to fulfill its obligations with respect to indemnification hereunder
or to defend itself against suits or claims of others. Parent and Target shall
duly preserve all files, records or any similar items of Parent or Target
received or obtained as a result of the Transactions with the same care and
for the same period of time as it would preserve its own similar assets.



7.5 _Expenses_.



(a) Except as provided in _Sections 10.2(b)_ , _10.2(c)_ and _7.19_ , each
party shall bear solely and entirely, all Expenses (as defined below) that
they incur; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated for any
reason, then the allocable share of the Parent Parties and Target for all
Expenses (including any fees and expenses of accountants, experts, and
consultants, but excluding the fees and expenses of legal counsel and
investment bankers) related to preparing, printing, filing and mailing the
Registration Statement, the Proxy/Prospectus and all SEC and other
regulatory filing fees incurred in connection with the Registration
Statement, Proxy/Prospectus and HSR shall be allocated one-half each.



(b) " _Expenses_ " as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of outside
counsel, accountants, financing sources, investment bankers, experts and
consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on
its behalf in connection with or related to the due diligence, authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the
preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Registration Statement, the
Proxy/Prospectus, the solicitation of stockholder approvals, requisite HSR
filings and all other matters related to the consummation of the Transactions
(subject to reasonable documentation).



7.6 _Cooperation_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, from the
date hereof until the Effective Time, each party shall confer on a regular
and frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other parties to
report operational matters of materiality and the general status of ongoing
operations and shall promptly provide the other party or its counsel with
copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.



7.7 _Publicity_. Neither Target, Parent nor any of their respective
affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Transactions without the prior consultation
of the other party, except as may be required by law or by any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange, and each party shall use
reasonable efforts to provide copies of such release or other announcement to
the other party hereto, and give due consideration to such comments as each
such other party may have, prior to such release or other announcement. 



 

58 7.8 _Additional Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations, or
to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, to consummate and
make effective the Transactions, subject, however, to the Target Stockholders
Approval and the Parent Stockholders Approval. Parent shall cause the Merger
Sub to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement to which Merger Sub is a party.



7.9 _Filings_. Each party shall make all filings such party is required
to make in connection herewith or desirable to achieve the purposes
contemplated hereby, and shall cooperate as needed with respect to any such
filing by any other party.



7.10 _Consents_. Each of Parent and Target shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents necessary or advisable in
connection with its obligations hereunder.



7.11 _Certain Parent Board Approvals_. Parent shall use its best
efforts to cause its Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time to approve
in the form required by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act certain
acquisitions of Parent Common Shares pursuant to the Merger, as directed by
Target and in form reasonably acceptable to Target.



7.12 _Parent Board of Directors_.



(a) Parent shall use its best efforts to cause Robert L. Gerry III and
Isaac Arnold, Jr. (the " _Director Nominees_ ") to be elected as members of
Parents Board of Directors by Parents existing Board of Directors
simultaneous with Closing, subject to applicable law. Each Director Nominee
shall serve as a director for a term expiring at Parents next annual meeting
of stockholders following the Effective Time and until his successor is
elected and qualified. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
Director Nominee shall be unable to serve as a director at the Effective
Time, Targets Board of Directors or nominating committee shall nominate
another individual who is a member of Targets Board of Directors and is
reasonably acceptable to Parent to serve in such individuals place. Parent
shall take such action, including amending its bylaws, as required to cause
the number of directors constituting Parents Board of Directors immediately
after the Effective Time to be increased as necessary to reflect the addition
of the Director Nominees.



(b) The composition of the committees of Parents Board of Directors
immediately following the Effective Time (including the respective chairmen
thereof) shall be as designated at or immediately following the Effective
Time in the sole discretion of Parents Board of Directors.



7.13 _Stockholders  Meetings._



(a) Target shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof (i) take all steps reasonably necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special or annual meeting of its stockholders regardless of
whether the Target Board of Directors determines at any time that this
Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable or recommends that the Target
Stockholders reject this Agreement or the Merger (the " _Target Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of securing the Target Stockholders Approval, (ii) distribute
to its stockholders the





 

59 Proxy/Prospectus in accordance with applicable federal and state law and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which Proxy/Prospectus shall contain

solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of approval of this Agreement
and to secure the Target Stockholders Approval, and (iv) cooperate and
consult with Parent with respect to each of the foregoing matters; provided,

Board of Directors from failing to make or from withdrawing or modifying its
recommendation to the Target stockholders hereunder if such Board of
Directors, after consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that such action is necessary for Targets Board of Directors to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Target agrees that its obligations pursuant to
this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Target or any other person
of any Target Acquisition Proposal.

of Directors from failing to make or from withdrawing or modifying its

Directors, after consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that such action is necessary for such Board of Directors to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent agrees that its obligations pursuant to
this _Section 7.13(b)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Parent or any other person
of any Parent Acquisition Proposal.



(c) Notwithstanding the receipt by Target of a Target Superior Proposal,
then, unless Parent terminates this Agreement under _Section 10.1(h)_ , prior
to the termination of this Agreement taking effect under _Section 10.1(h)_ ,
Target shall be obligated to comply with  _Section 7.13(a)_ and the other
terms of this Agreement, including by holding the Target Meeting. If (x) a

terminated by Target under _Section 10.1(h)_ , Target shall pay to Parent the





 

60 Termination Fee and the Expenses of Parent up to the Target Expense Cap as
provided in _Section 10.2_. Target acknowledges and agrees that Parent would
be damaged irreparably if any provision of this _Section 7.13(c)_ is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached.
Accordingly, Target agrees that Parent will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this _Section 7.13(c)_ and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and its terms and provisions in any action or
proceeding instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to any other
remedy to which Parent may be entitled, at law or in equity.



(d) Notwithstanding the receipt by Parent of a Parent Superior Proposal,
then, unless Target terminates this Agreement under _Section 10.1(j)_ , prior
to the termination of this Agreement taking effect under _Section 10.1(j)_ ,
Parent shall be obligated to comply with _Section 7.13(b)_ and the other terms
of this Agreement, including by holding the Parent Meeting. If (x) a Parent
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made or shall have otherwise become
publicly known or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (y)
Parents Board of Directors withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation

time this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated by Parent under 
_Section 10.1(j)_ , Parent shall pay to Target the Termination Fee and the
Expenses of Target up to the Parent Expense Cap as provided in _Section 10.2_.

its specific terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, Parent agrees that
Target will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this _Section 7.13(d)_ and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its
terms and provisions in any action or proceeding instituted in any court of
the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties
and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which Target may be
entitled, at law or in equity.



7.14 _Preparation of the Proxy/Prospectus and Registration Statement_.



(a) Parent and Target shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC a
preliminary version of the Proxy/Prospectus and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC in connection
therewith and to furnish all information required to prepare the definitive
Proxy/Prospectus. In addition to the matters requiring Parent
stockholder approval pursuant to _Section 5.19_ , Parent may also include in
the Proxy/Prospectus a proposal for Parents stockholders to approve an
amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of Parent
Common Shares authorized for issuance under its certificate of incorporation
to 150,000,000 shares. At any time from (and including) the initial filing
with the SEC of the Proxy/Prospectus, Parent shall file with the SEC the
Registration Statement containing the Proxy/Prospectus so long as Parent
shall have provided to Target a copy of the Registration Statement containing
the Proxy/Prospectus at least ten days prior to any filing thereof and any
supplement or amendment at least two days prior to any filing thereof.
Subject to the foregoing sentence, Parent and Target shall jointly determine
the date that the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC. Parent and
Target shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as





 

61 practicable after such filing. Parent shall also take any action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or filing a general consent to service of process in any
jurisdiction) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws
in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Shares in the Merger and
Target shall furnish all information concerning Target and the holders of
shares of Target capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. Promptly after the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, Parent and Target shall cause the Proxy/Prospectus to be mailed to
their respective stockholders, and if necessary, after the definitive
Proxy/Prospectus has been mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemented or
supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection therewith, re-
solicit proxies or written consents, as applicable. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent or Target discover
any statement which, in light of the circumstances to which it is made, is
false or misleading with respect to a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary to make the statement made in the proxy/prospectus not
misleading, then such party shall immediately notify the other party of
such misstatements or omissions. Parent shall advise Target and Target shall
advise Parent, as applicable, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement becomes effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Shares for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy/Prospectus
or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information.



(b) Following receipt by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Parents independent
auditors, of an appropriate request from Target pursuant to SAS No. 72,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to
Target a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, dated a date within two
business days before the effective date of the Registration Statement, and
addressed to Target, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Target
and customary in scope and substance for "cold comfort" letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements and
proxy statements similar to the Proxy/Prospectus.



(c) Following receipt by KPMG LLP, Targets independent auditors, of an
appropriate request from Parent pursuant to SAS No. 72, Target shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter
of KPMG LLP, dated a date within two business days before the Effective Date
of the Registration Statement, and addressed to Parent, in form and substance
satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for "cold
comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements and proxy statements similar to the
Proxy/Prospectus.



7.15 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the
Merger and to be issued upon the exercise of options to purchase Parent Common
Shares or upon conversion of the Debentures (including by way of exchange of
TECONS for Debentures and thereupon the conversion of such Debentures) to be
approved and admitted for listing on the New York Stock Exchange at least ten
consecutive trading days prior to the Effective Time, subject to official
notice of issuance.



 

62 7.16 _Employee Matters_.



(a) Subsequent to the Effective Time, Parent shall perform or cause Target
to perform the obligations of Target under the severance agreements and
severance plans to which Target is a party or subject and which are set forth
in Section 4.11(e) of the Target Disclosure Schedule. 



(b) To the extent service is relevant for purposes of eligibility,
participation or vesting (but not the accrual of benefits) under any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent in
which Business Employees may participate, such Business Employees shall be
credited for service accrued as of the Effective Time with Target and its
Subsidiaries to the extent such service was credited under a similar plan,
program or arrangement of Target.



(c) To the extent Business Employees and their dependents enroll in any
health plan sponsored by Parent, Parent shall waive any preexisting condition
limitation applicable to such Business Employees to the extent that the
employees or dependents condition would not have operated as a preexisting
condition under the group health plan maintained by Target. In addition,
Parent shall cause such health plans (i) to waive all preexisting condition
exclusions and waiting periods otherwise applicable to Business Employees and
their dependents, other than exclusions or waiting periods that are in effect
with respect to such individuals as of the Effective Time to the extent not
satisfied, under the corresponding benefit plans of Target, and (ii) to
provide each Business Employee and his or her dependents with corresponding
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid by them under the
corresponding benefit plans of Target during the portion of the respective
plan year prior to the Effective Time. 



(d) With respect to the 401(k) accounts of those Business Employees who
become eligible to participate in Parents 401(k) Plan after the Effective
Time, Parent agrees to take one or more of the following actions: (i) to
establish an arrangement under which such Business Employees are provided
with payroll withholding for purposes of repaying any loan that is outstanding
under Targets 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time, (ii) to permit such
Business Employees to voluntarily transfer or rollover their accounts
(including loans) from Targets 401(k) Plan to Parents 401(k) Plan; or (iii)
to cause Parents 401(k) Plan to accept a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer
of assets from Targets 401(k) Plan into Parents 401(k) Plan, including any
outstanding loans, on behalf of such Business Employees. Parent and Target
agree that they shall take all actions necessary, including the amendment of
their respective plans, to effect the actions selected by Parent under
the preceding sentence.



(e) With respect to any Business Employees who become employed by Parent
after the Effective Time, Parent will permit such Business Employees to
schedule and take vacation days that have accrued prior to the Effective Time
with pay through December 31, 2004, and Parent shall give service credit for
purposes of determining post Effective Time vacation, sick leave and any other
paid time off entitlements that Parent provides to its employees generally.

 





 

63 (f) At the Effective Time, Target will freeze the accrual of benefits
under Targets Deferred Compensation Plan.



(g) Target and Parent shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects relating to any actions to be taken pursuant to this _Section 7.16_.



For purposes of this _Section 7.16_ , a " _Business Employee_ " shall mean an
individual who is employed by Target prior to the Effective Time and who
thereafter remains or becomes an employee of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent.



7.17 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each party to this Agreement shall
promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other parties of:



(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person (or other Person) is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions;

connection with the Transactions;



(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or

_Sections 4.10_ , _4.1_ 2, 5.10 or  _5.12_ , or which relate to the
consummation of the Transactions;



(d) any notice of, or other communication relating to, a default or event
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default, received
by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date hereof, under any
material agreement; and



(e) any Target Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect or
the occurrence of any event which is reasonably likely to result in a Target
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be.

Parent, including a statement acknowledging and describing the adjustments to

into which the TECONS and the Debentures are convertible as set forth in
_Section 3.1(c)_ herein. In addition, at or prior to the Effective Time, (i)

efforts to cause Persons who become "affiliates" after such date but prior to
the Closing Date to execute and deliver agreements at least 5 days prior to
the Closing Date.





 

65 (b) Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

securities of Parent referred to in the Parent SEC Reports to avoid defaults
thereunder. In particular, at or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall

deliver to Parent, for redelivery to such respective trustees, an Opinion of
Counsel, in form reasonably satisfactory to such trustees, to the effect that
immediately prior to Effective Time no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing under the indenture for the Targets 9 3/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2010.



7.23 _Parent Rights Plan_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Parents Board of
Directors from adopting a stockholder rights or similar agreement or plan to
improve the ability of Parents Board of Directors to protect the interests
of Parent and its stockholders in the event of a Parent Acquisition Proposal.



7.24 _No Triggering Event_. Parent and Target will use their best
efforts to cooperate with each other and comply with any reasonable request
to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not

practicable after the date hereof, and in any event no later than February 27,
2004, Target shall cause all Target Common Shares that are held in Targets

or other security that might be required of any other party with respect
thereto.



11.9 _Attorneys  Fees_. If any action at law or equity, including an
action for declaratory relief, is brought to enforce or interpret any
provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to

 Exhibit 7.20



Form of Affiliate Agreement



Plains Exploration and Production Company

700 Milam, Suite 3100 

Houston, Texas 77002



Gentlemen:



Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger
Agreement_ ") dated February 12, 2004 between Plains Exploration and Production
Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), PXP California Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Nuevo Energy Company, a Delaware
corporation ("Target"), pursuant to which Target and Parent shall merge.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, each share of Common
Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Target owned by the undersigned as of the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall be converted into
and exchangeable for certain shares of the common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Shares_ ").



The undersigned understands that he may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of
Target for purposes of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " _Act_ "). The undersigned is delivering this letter of
undertaking and commitment pursuant to Section 7.20 of the Merger Agreement.



With respect to such Parent Common Shares the undersigned may receive under
the Merger Agreement (the " _Shares_ "), the undersigned represents to and
agrees with Parent that:



A. The undersigned shall not make any offer to sell or any sale or other
disposition of all or any part of the Shares in violation of the Act or the
rules and regulations thereunder, including Rule 145, and shall hold all the
Shares subject to all applicable provisions of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 



B. The undersigned has been advised that the offering, sale and delivery
of the Shares to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger Agreement shall be
registered under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. The
undersigned has also been advised, however, that, since the undersigned may
be deemed an "affiliate" of Target, any public reoffering or resale by the
undersigned of any of the Shares shall, under current law, require either (i)
the further registration under the Act of the Shares to be sold,
(ii) compliance with Rule 145 promulgated under the Act (permitting limited
sales under certain circumstances) or (iii) the availability of another
exemption from registration under the Act.



C. The undersigned also understands that, if Parent should deem it
necessary to comply with the requirements of the Act, stop transfer
instructions will be given to its transfer agents with respect to the Shares and that there will be placed on
the certificates for the Shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend
stating in substance:



"The securities represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction
under Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act"), and may be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of only upon
receipt by the Corporation of an opinion of counsel acceptable to it that the
securities are being sold in compliance with the limitations of Rule 145 or
that some other exemption from registration under the Act is available, or
pursuant to a registration statement under the Act."



Execution of this letter shall not be considered an admission on the part of
the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of Target for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Act or as a waiver of any rights the undersigned
may have to any claim that the undersigned is not such an affiliate on or
after the date of this letter.
