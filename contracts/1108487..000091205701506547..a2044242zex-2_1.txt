Secretary of State of the State of California (the "EFFECTIVE DATE").

                  (d)      EFFECT OF THE MERGERS.

         The certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving
corporations, in each case as in effect on the Effective Date, shall be the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, Merger
Sub III, Merger Sub IV and Merger Sub V, respectively, except that the first
Article of each such certificate of incorporation shall be amended to amend the

                                (A) UBIQUITEL STOCK.

         The right to receive a number of shares of UbiquiTel Stock, along with
any dividends or distributions thereon after the Effective Date, determined in
accordance with the provisions of EXHIBIT 1.2.

                                (B) NET ASSETS CONSIDERATION.

         The right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Net Assets (as
defined herein) divided by the total number of Evans shares issued and
outstanding at the EFFECTIVE DATE (the "Net Assets Consideration"). The Net
Assets Consideration shall be paid to the Evans Stockholders (as defined below)
on the Effective Date, except that the amount of cash and cash equivalents in
the RTFC escrow shall be paid only when it has been received by UbiquiTel, all
pursuant to Section 2.1(g). "NET ASSETS" shall mean cash and cash equivalents of
Evans and its subsidiaries as of the EFFECTIVE DATE, plus the amount of any Tax
refunds or overpayments to which Evans and its subsidiaries are entitled as of
the EFFECTIVE DATE minus liabilities of Evans and its subsidiaries as of the
EFFECTIVE DATE, including the liability for Taxes of Evans and its subsidiaries,
but not including any deferred Tax liabilities as determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

                                (I) CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF NET ASSETS.

         EXHIBIT 1.2(b)(ii)(B)(I) presents Evans' good faith estimate of the Net
Assets (the "ESTIMATED NET ASSETS STATEMENT"). Between the date hereof and the
PRE-CLOSING DATE (as defined in Section 2.1), Evans and UbiquiTel Parent shall
cooperate in an effort to reach agreement on the amount of the assets and
liabilities to be set forth on the Net Assets Statement (as defined in (II)
below) to be delivered by Evans at the PRE-CLOSING (as defined in Section 2.1).
To this end, the Controlling Evans Stockholders and the remaining stockholders
of Evans (as identified on EXHIBIT 1.2(b)(ii)(B)(II) attached hereto (the
"REMAINING EVANS STOCKHOLDERS," and together with the Controlling Evans
Stockholders, the "EVANS STOCKHOLDERS")) shall cause Evans to cooperate fully
with UbiquiTel Parent and its tax advisers, and shall promptly provide UbiquiTel
Parent with all information, records, tax returns, work papers, and access to
Evans' tax advisers as is necessary to enable UbiquiTel Parent to understand the
basis for Evans' calculations.

                                (II) CLOSING NET ASSETS STATEMENT.

         Prior to the PRE-CLOSING DATE, the Evans Representative (as defined in
Section 3.3 (LLC PARTIES' CONDITIONS TO CLOSING) herein) shall deliver to
UbiquiTel Parent a statement of the Net Assets dated as of the close of business
on the day immediately preceding the PRE-CLOSING DATE (the "NET ASSETS
STATEMENT"). The Net Assets Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
same principles, methods and procedures used in the preparation of the Estimated
Net Assets Statement. If UbiquiTel Parent agrees with the Net Assets Statement
as delivered by the Evans Representative, it shall so signify by initialing the
same. If it disagrees with the Net Assets Statement it shall, on or before the
PRE-CLOSING DATE, deliver to the Evans Representative a revised net assets
statement (the "REVISED NET ASSETS STATEMENT"). If UbiquiTel Parent delivers to
the Evans Representative a Revised Net Assets Statement, then the amount of the
difference between the liabilities shown on the Net Assets Statement and the
liabilities shown on the Revised Net Assets Statement shall be deposited by
UbiquiTel Parent in a separate interest-bearing account until the filing of the
tax returns described in Section 11.7 (TAX MATTERS IN EVANS MERGER) herein.

                 (III) PAYMENT OF TAX RETURN ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT.

         Within 5 days after the filing of the Tax Returns described in Section
11.7, (i) UbiquiTel shall pay to the Evans Representative the amount (including
the amounts, if any, deposited in a separate account pursuant to (II) above and
interest thereon), if any, by which the amount of Net Assets, as adjusted for
Taxes for which the Evans Stockholders are responsible under Section 11.7 and
Tax refunds or Tax overpayments to which Evans or its subsidiaries was entitled
as of the EFFECTIVE DATE, in either case, only to the extent not previously
taken into account in determining the Net Assets, exceeds the amount of the Net
Assets as set forth on the Net Assets Statement or Revised Net Assets Statement
above, or (ii) the Evans Representative shall pay to UbiquiTel the amount (with
a credit for the amounts, if any, deposited in a separate account pursuant to
(II) above), if any, by which Net Assets, as adjusted for Taxes for which the
Evans Stockholders are responsible under Section 11.7 and Tax refunds or Tax
overpayments to which Evans or its subsidiaries was entitled as of the EFFECTIVE
DATE, in either case, only to the extent not previously taken into account in
determining the Net Assets, is less than the Net Assets as set forth on the Net
Assets Statement or Revised Net Assets Statement above. If any Tax refund is
taken into account in the calculation of the Net Assets, UbiquiTel Parent or
Evans, as the case may be, shall make any payment attributable thereto within
ten (10) days following the date on which UbiquiTel Parent or Evans actually
receives the refund. Payments, if any, pursuant to this Section 1.2 shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Parties shall treat
any payment made pursuant to this paragraph (III) as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration for all purposes.

                  (c)    RIGHTS AS HOLDERS.

         On and after the Effective Date, holders of stock of the Members
(including the Evans Stockholders in lieu of the CVC stockholder if the Evans
Merger occurs) shall cease to have any rights as stockholders except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in this Section 1.2 with respect
to shares of the Members' or Evans', as the case may be, stock held by them (all
of such stock being referred to herein as "STOCK"). The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender for exchange of Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed, when paid or issued hereunder, to have been paid
or issued, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Stock or UbiquiTel Stock.

                  (d)      ANTI-DILUTION.

                           (i) In the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization, combination or exchange of shares with
respect to, or rights issued to all UbiquiTel Parent stockholders in respect
of, UbiquiTel Stock on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Date, the consideration payable in the Mergers and to the Selling Member shall
be adjusted accordingly.

                           (ii) UbiquiTel Parent and UbiquiTel each agree that
they shall not take any action for the purposes of avoiding the provisions of
this Section 1.2(d). In the event that UbiquiTel Parent or UbiquiTel shall
enter into any transaction which is for the purpose of, or which results in,
the avoidance of the provisions of this section, the benefits provided by this
section shall nevertheless apply and be preserved.

                  (e)      TREASURY STOCK.

         All shares of capital stock of the Members or Evans, as the case may
be, that are held as treasury stock shall, on the Effective Date, be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no shares of UbiquiTel Stock or other
consideration shall be delivered or owing in exchange therefor.

         1.3      PURCHASE OF LLC INTEREST FROM THE SELLING MEMBER.

                  (a)      PURCHASE AND SALE.

         At the CLOSING, the Selling Member agrees to sell, and UbiquiTel Parent
agrees to cause Merger Sub VI to purchase, all of the LLC Interest held by the
Selling Member for the consideration determined in accordance with the
provisions of EXHIBIT 1.2 attached hereto. The purchase and sale of the LLC
Interest by the Selling Member to Merger Sub VI herein is referred to as the
"INTEREST SALE."

                  (b)      PURCHASE PRICE.

         The purchase price for the LLC Interest included in the Interest Sale
shall be the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of UbiquiTel Stock, along with any dividends or
distributions thereon after the Effective Date determined in accordance with
the provisions of EXHIBIT 1.2 attached hereto.

                  (c)      DELIVERIES.

         At the Pre-CLOSING, the Selling Member shall execute and deliver to
Greenberg Traurig, to hold in escrow pursuant to Section 2.1(c), documents of
transfer in a form reasonably required by Merger Sub VI, and the Selling Member
shall execute such additional agreements, including without limitation,
amendments to the Operating Agreement, as shall reasonably be deemed to be
appropriate and necessary in order to transfer the LLC Interest being sold by
the Selling Member. The Selling Member's LLC Interest shall be transferred at
CLOSING by delivery of such documents of transfer to Merger Sub VI.

                  (d)      CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATING THE INTEREST SALE.

         The obligations of Merger Sub VI or UbiquiTel Parent and the Selling
Member to consummate the Interest Sale are conditioned on the CLOSING of the
Mergers.

         1.4      PERFORMANCE UNIT APPRECIATION RIGHTS PLAN.


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

         EXHIBIT 1.4 lists the holders of the 8,750 LLC Performance Unit
Appreciation Rights ("PARS") currently outstanding under LLC's Performance Unit
Appreciation Rights Plan (the "PAR PLAN"), and the number of PARs held by each
such holder. At the Effective Date, LLC shall terminate its PAR Plan, and each
holder of PARs shall become entitled to receive, in substitution for the PARs
previously held by each such holder and subject to the provisions of this
Section 1.4, the number of shares of UbiquiTel Stock set forth opposite each
holder's name on EXHIBIT 1.4. All of such shares shall be issued to the former
PAR holders at the CLOSING DATE, and one-half of such shares shall be
distributed to each such holder on the CLOSING DATE. The other half of such
shares shall be distributed to each such holder on the date that is 180 days
following the CLOSING DATE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any such holder
voluntarily terminates his employment with UbiquiTel prior to such 180th day
following the CLOSING DATE, such one-half of such holder's shares shall be
forfeited and shall be cancelled unilaterally by UbiquiTel Parent (or its
transfer agent) on its stock transfer records. During such 180 days, each such
holder shall be entitled to vote the shares that have not been distributed to
him or her, to receive dividends on such shares, and to all other beneficial
rights as owner of such shares (other than the right to transfer, sell or
otherwise dispose of such shares). If any shares of UbiquiTel Stock are
forfeited hereunder by one or more holders because any such holder has
voluntarily terminated its employment with UbiquiTel prior to the 180th day
following the CLOSING DATE, such shares, after cancellation by UbiquiTel Parent
(or its transfer agent), shall be redistributed instead to the Stockholders and
the Selling Member, proportionately based on the total number of shares of
UbiquiTel Stock to be received by such Person in accordance with the provisions
of EXHIBIT 1.2. Each holder listed on EXHIBIT 1.4 shall be a third-party
beneficiary of the agreements of UbiquiTel set forth in this Section 1.4,
entitled to enforce the same for his benefit.

         1.5      NO FRACTIONAL SHARES.

         No certificates representing fractional shares of UbiquiTel Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Stock or the LLC Interests,
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to have any rights of a stockholder of UbiquiTel Parent. In lieu of any such
fractional shares, each holder of Stock or the LLC Interests who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of UbiquiTel Stock will
receive a full share of UbiquiTel Stock, if the fraction is one-half or
greater, and shall not receive such fractional share, if the fraction is less
than one-half.

         1.6      ESCROW OF SHARES.

         On the CLOSING DATE, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Escrow Agreement (as defined in Section 2.4(d) (ESCROW AGREEMENT)
herein), the Stockholders (except for Evans and including the Controlling Evans
Stockholders, if the Evans Merger occurs) and the Selling Member shall deposit
into the escrow created by the Escrow Agreement (the "ESCROW ACCOUNT") the
aggregate amount of 2,000,000 shares of UbiquiTel Stock (the "ESCROW AMOUNT");
and each Stockholder (except for Evans and including the Controlling Evans
Stockholders, if the Evans Merger occurs) and the Selling Member will deposit
the number of shares set forth in Exhibit 1.2. The Escrow Amount shall be held
and disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Sections 3.2(a)(LLC
PARTIES' REPRESENTATIONS TRUE) and 12.3 (LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNITIES) of this
Agreement.

shall take place on the third business day after the satisfaction or written
waiver of the conditions (other than the execution or delivery of agreements,
certificates, legal opinions or other instruments to be delivered at the
Pre-CLOSING) contained herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if on such date Evans
still owns the Evans Telco Businesses, then, at Evans' discretion, it can
extend the PRE-CLOSING to a date which is three (3) days after the sale of the
Evans Telco Businesses, but in no event shall Evans be permitted to extend the
PRE-CLOSING (for this reason) after June 30, 2001. The date of the PRE-CLOSING

commercially reasonable efforts to give advance notice of the proposed

foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)(A), all of such documents so delivered shall be
dated as of the Pre-Closing Date and shall be delivered on the Closing Date
without redating or modification.

                  (d)      SPECTRUM TRANSITION.

         Immediately following the PRE-CLOSING DATE, UbiquiTel shall take such
steps, all at its sole cost and expense, as may be necessary promptly to
implement and complete the Spectrum Transition (as defined in Addendum VI to
the UbiquiTel Sprint Management Agreement). LLC shall take all necessary
actions and provide access to its properties for the purpose of enabling
UbiquiTel to complete the Spectrum Transition.

                  (e)      PROXY OF THE MEMBERS OF LLC.

         On the PRE-CLOSING DATE, each Member of LLC shall, and the
Stockholders controlling such Member shall cause such Member to, execute an
irrevocable proxy in the form attached as Exhibit 2.1(e) giving UbiquiTel the
right to vote all Members' Interests then owned by such Member during the
PRE-CLOSING Period. The Parties acknowledge, and agree not to contest, that
such irrevocable proxy is intended to be an irrevocable appointment of a proxy
for all purposes pursuant to Section 705(e)(2) of the CCC.

         In addition to the covenants and warranties of the Parties set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement, and as a special covenant related solely to the
period between the PRE-CLOSING DATE and the CLOSING DATE (the "PRE-CLOSING
Period"), each Party covenants, warrants, and agrees that he, she, or it will
take no action or forego to take any actions during the PRE-CLOSING Period that
would cause any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement on
behalf of such Party or any Affiliate of such Party to become untrue or
inaccurate, or that would be inconsistent with any such representation or
warranty, or that would cause any document delivered pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
on behalf of such Party or an Affiliate of such Party to become untrue or
inaccurate or that would be inconsistent with any such document.

                  (g)      PAYMENT OF EVANS' NET ASSETS CONSIDERATION.

UbiquiTel against such Loss pursuant to Section 12.2, provided that, (A) to the
extent such Loss can be quantified and agreed upon at the PRE-CLOSING by all

Certificate, which shall state the foregoing.

         For purposes of this Article 6, unless otherwise expressly stated
herein or the context requires otherwise, the "COMPANIES" shall mean LLC and the
LLC Subsidiary, collectively and "COMPANY" shall mean LLC or LLC Subsidiary,
singularly. References to "LLC'S KNOWLEDGE" or words of similar import mean (i)
the actual knowledge of David S. Nelson, Delwyn C. Williams, Matthew J. Boos,
Harold Midgley, Kathy Mueller, Kathleen Taormina and David Frost, and (ii) the
knowledge the foregoing individuals would have after reasonable inquiry and
diligence. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article 12 (INDEMNIFICATION)
hereof, the Members and the Stockholders, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to UbiquiTel Parent, UbiquiTel and the Merger Subs that, except as
specifically set forth on the disclosure schedule to this Article 6, which shall
be organized by section and sub-section numbers corresponding to this Article 6

         6.1      LLC; ENTRY INTO AGREEMENTS.

                  (a)      ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.

laws. LLC Subsidiary is a limited liability company duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Nevada and is in good standing under
such laws. Each of the Companies has all requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate all properties and assets owned or leased by it and to conduct
its business as previously and currently conducted by it. Each of the Companies
is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which it is required to be so qualified, except where the lack of such
qualification would not have a material adverse effect on the Companies. The LLC
Disclosure Schedule lists all jurisdictions in which each Company is qualified
to do business as a foreign entity. LLC has made available to UbiquiTel true,
correct and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of LLC and LLC
Subsidiary, as currently in effect. LLC is a successor in interest to Central
Wireless Partnership, which was a general partnership duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of California. The merger of Central Wireless
Partnership into LLC conformed in all material respects with the laws of
California and all necessary action was taken to cause LLC to succeed to all of
the properties, franchises, permits, liabilities, and businesses of Central
Wireless Partnership.

                  As used in this Agreement, the term "ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS"

corporation; (b) the partnership agreement and any statement of partnership of a
general partnership; (c) the limited partnership agreement and the certificate
of limited partnership of a limited partnership; (d) the articles or certificate
of organization and the regulations or operating agreement of a limited
liability company; (e) any charter or similar document adopted or filed in
connection with the creation, formation, or organization of an entity; and (f)
any amendment to any of the foregoing.

                  (b)      VALIDITY AND AUTHORIZATION; POWER AND AUTHORITY.

         This Agreement and the Related Agreements have been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by LLC and constitute (or, in the case of Related
Agreements or instruments called for hereby or thereby to be executed by LLC at
or before the CLOSING, upon execution will constitute) the legal, valid and
binding obligation of LLC enforceable against LLC in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws relating to creditors' rights generally
and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

outstanding equity interests of LLC Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens (as
defined in Section 6.4(a)(i) (TITLE) herein), other than Permitted Liens (as
defined in Section 6.4(a)(i) (TITLE) herein).

                  (d)      NO CONFLICT.

obligations required under, (iv) constitute a default under, (v) give any right
of termination or cancellation under, or (vi) give any right to make any change

(ORDERS) herein), or any agreement, contract, note, bond, debenture, indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, lease, License, judgment, decree, order, law, rule or
regulation or other restriction applicable to any Company or to which any
Company is a party or by which any Company or its property or assets are bound
or affected that, in any such case, will result in a material adverse effect on
any Company. Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
or the Related Agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of any Company.

         LLC or LLC Subsidiary is the owner of the assets reflected in the LLC

                           (ii)     LEASES.

         The LLC Disclosure Schedule sets forth a description of the nature of
each Company's possession and use of the land, premises, buildings, structures
and improvements held by lease, license or otherwise (the "LEASED PREMISES") and
sets forth a description of the material basic terms of the lease or other
instrument involved (including, without limitation, the term, the number of
renewal options, if any, and the amount of rent or charges due thereunder), such
leases, subleases (including, without limitation, the prime leases governing
such subleases), licenses, easement agreements or co-location agreements with
respect thereto, including all amendments or modifications thereto and all
assignments thereof, together with those agreements in which a Company has
leased certain portions of the Real Property to third parties and/or has
subleased or licensed portions of the Leased Premises to third parties, all as
described in the LLC Disclosure Schedule, the "REAL ESTATE CONTRACTS".

         The Company identified as such in the LLC Disclosure Schedule is the
sole holder of valid and subsisting leases, licenses or other interests in the
Leased Premises as specified therein, free and clear of any Liens, other than
Permitted Liens. All rental payments, charges, fees and other amounts due and
payable by any Company in connection with the Real Estate Contracts are current,
there are no defaults by any Company with respect thereto or, to LLC's
knowledge, by any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that, with the
passing of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default (x)
by any Company thereunder or (y) to LLC's knowledge, by any other party
thereunder. The lessors, licensors, sublessors or grantors to LLC under the Real
Estate Contracts (the "LESSORS") have no defense, setoff or counterclaim against
any Company or against any Member arising out of the Real Estate Contracts or in
any way relating thereto. No lessee, sublessee or licensee of any Company has a
defense, setoff or counterclaim against any Company arising out of the Real
Estate Contracts or in any way related thereto. All options in favor of any
Company to purchase any of the Leased Premises, if any, are in full force and
effect and are described in the LLC Disclosure Schedule. To the extent
applicable to the Leased Premises, such Company is in exclusive and continuing
possession of the Leased Premises and, subject to the terms of the related Real
Estate Contract, has the right to quiet enjoyment of the Leased Premises for the
full term of the related Real Estate Contract and any renewal option related
thereto. Each Real Estate Contract is in full force and effect and has not been
modified, changed, altered or amended in any respect (other than as set forth in
the LLC Disclosure Schedule), no Real Estate Contract is terminable as a result
of the transaction contemplated herein, and no leasehold or other interest of
any Company in the Leased Premises is subject or subordinate to any Lien, other
than Permitted Liens. LLC has made available to UbiquiTel true, correct and
complete copies of all Real Estate Contracts, including any and all subleases,
amendments or supplements thereto, and guaranties or other security in
connection therewith. There are no leasing or other fees or commissions due, nor
will any become due, in connection with the Real Estate Contracts or any
renewals or extensions or expansions thereunder.

         The Real Estate Contracts constitute all agreements with respect to the
leases, licenses and other interests set forth in the LLC Disclosure Schedule,
and there are no agreements, written or oral, other than the Real Estate
Contracts, concerning the Leased Premises. No Company has assigned its interest
in any of the Real Estate Contracts nor sublet any of the Leased Premises
thereunder, nor does any Company hold and occupy the Leased Premises under
assignment or sublease from any other party, except as provided in the LLC
Disclosure Schedule. No Company has received any written notice of, or has any
knowledge with respect to, any current violation of any judgment, writ, decree,

Disabilities Act, on the Leased Premises or the Real Property, and the
applicable Company is in occupancy and possession of the Leased Premises and the

is a party ("TOWER LEASES"), to LLC's knowledge, (A) there are no applications,
ordinances, petitions, resolutions or other matters pending before any
governmental agency having jurisdiction to act on zoning changes that would
prohibit or make nonconforming the use of any of the Leased Premises by such
Company, (B) no Company has voluntarily granted any, and is not a party to any
agreement providing for, any easements, conditions, restrictions, reservations,
rights or options that would materially and adversely affect the use of the

         There are no liabilities of any Company, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no existing
condition, situation or set of circumstances having specific application to the
Companies (excluding general, economic or industry conditions) which could
reasonably be expected to result in any such liability, other than (i)
liabilities disclosed and/or provided for in the most recent LLC Financial
Statements, (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices since the date of the most recent LLC Financial
Statements, or (iii) liabilities under this Agreement or the Related Agreements
or reflected in any schedule, exhibit or other documents delivered in connection
herewith or therewith.

                  (b)      TAX MATTERS.

                           (i)      All material Tax Returns required to be
filed by or on behalf of each Company have been properly prepared and timely
filed with the appropriate taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which
such Tax Returns are required to be filed (after giving effect to any valid
extensions of time in which to make such filings) and all such Tax Returns
were true, complete and correct in all material respects. LLC has been subject
to tax as a partnership for federal, state, local and foreign income tax
purposes since its inception.

                           (ii)     All Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) payable by or on behalf of the Companies have been fully and timely
paid, including all required estimated tax payments sufficient to avoid any
understatement penalties. The cash reserves or accruals for Taxes provided in
the books and records of the Company with respect to any period for which Tax
Returns have not yet been

                                    -30-

<PAGE>

filed or for which Taxes are not yet due and owing are, or prior to the
PRE-CLOSING DATE, will be, sufficient for all unpaid Taxes of the Company
through and including the PRE-CLOSING DATE (including, without limitation,
with respect to any Taxes resulting from the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). Neither Company has any liability for Taxes of any other Person as
a transferee, successor, by contract or otherwise, except with respect to
Taxes for which withholding may be required. There are no Liens as a result of
any unpaid Taxes upon any of the assets of the Companies.

                           (iii)    The Companies have not executed or filed
with the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority any agreement,
waiver or other document or arrangement extending or having the effect of
extending the period for assessment or collection of Taxes (including, but not
limited to, any applicable statute of limitation), and no power of attorney
with respect to any Tax matter is currently in force. The Companies are not
the subject of any private letter ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or
comparable rulings of other taxing authorities.

                           (iv)     The Companies have complied in all
material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to
the payment and withholding of Taxes on amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, Member or other third party and have duly
and timely withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities all
Taxes with respect to such amounts.

                           (v)      All deficiencies asserted or assessments
made as a result of any examinations by the Internal Revenue Service or any
other taxing authority of the Tax Returns of or covering or including the
Companies have been fully paid, and there are no other audits or
investigations by any taxing authority or proceedings in progress, nor have
the Members or the Companies received any notice from any taxing authority
that it intends to conduct such an audit or investigation. No issue has been
raised by a U.S. federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority in any
current or prior examination of the Companies which, by application of the
same or similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a
proposed material deficiency for any subsequent taxable period. No claim has
been made by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Companies do not
file Tax Returns such that they are or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.

                           (vi)     Neither the Companies, nor any other
Person (including any of the Members) on behalf of the Companies, has (A)
agreed to or is required to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 481(a) of
the Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law by reason of
a change in accounting method initiated by the Companies, or has any
application pending with any taxing authority requesting permission for any
changes in accounting methods that relate to the business or operations of the
Companies, or has otherwise taken any action that would have the effect of
deferring any liability for Taxes from any taxable period ending on or before
the EFFECTIVE DATE to any taxable period ending thereafter or (B) executed or
entered into a CLOSING agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any
predecessor provision thereof or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law with respect to the Companies.

                           (vii)    Except for this Agreement or as provided
in the Operating Agreement, the Companies are not parties to any tax-sharing
or similar agreement or arrangement (whether or not written) pursuant to which
the Companies will have any obligation to make any payments after the
PRE-CLOSING DATE.

                           (viii)    There is no contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement covering any person that, individually or collectively, could give
rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by UbiquiTel or
any of its Affiliates by reason of Section 280G of the Code, or would
constitute compensation in excess of the limitation set forth in Section
162(m) of the Code.

taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal

         6.7      EMPLOYEES.

                  (a)      To LLC's knowledge, no officer, employee or

Company or an ERISA Affiliate maintains or ever has maintained, or to which
the Combined Company or any ERISA Affiliate contributes, ever has contributed
or ever has been required to contribute in connection with its employees (the
"EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS"). None of the Employee Benefit Plans is a

ERISA.

                  (b)      All Employee Benefit Plans (and each related trust,
insurance contract or fund) comply in form and in operation in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of all laws, rules and regulations
governing or applying to such Employee Benefit Plans, including without
limitation ERISA and the Code, and each such Plan has been operated in

                  (c)      No liability has been incurred, and there exists no
material condition or circumstance which could result in any material
liability to any Combined Company or ERISA Affiliate under ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable law, other than liability for benefits due under the
appropriate Employee Benefit Plans. All contributions (including all employer
and employee salary reduction contributions) which are required to be made
under any of such Plans or by law (without regard to any waivers granted under
Section 412 of the Code), to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith, have been made by the due date thereof (including any
valid extension), and all contributions for any period ending on or before the
PRE-CLOSING DATE which are not yet due will have been paid on or prior to the
PRE-CLOSING DATE.

                  (d)      No Company or ERISA Affiliate, "party in interest"
or "disqualified person" with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans has
engaged in or permitted to occur, any transaction prohibited by ERISA Section
406 or any "prohibited transaction" under Code Section 4975(c) or any breach
of fiduciary duty under ERISA with respect to any Employee Benefit Plans,

each Employee Benefit Plan have been timely filed, and all notices and
disclosures to participants required by either ERISA or the Code, including

                                    -34-

<PAGE>

                  (f)      All the Combined Companies and ERISA Affiliates
have made available to UbiquiTel correct and complete copies of the plan
documents, contracts and summary plan descriptions, the most recent
determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service, where
applicable, the most recent three years of Form 5500 Annual Reports, where
applicable, all related trust agreements, insurance contracts and other
funding agreements which implement each Employee Benefit Plan, written
communications to employees relating to the Employee Benefit Plans, if any,
written descriptions of any non-written agreements relating to the Employee
Benefit Plans, if any, and such other documents requested by UbiquiTel with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan.

                  (g)      There are no pending actions, claims, lawsuits,
arbitrations, governmental or other proceedings or investigations which have
been asserted, instituted or threatened against the Employee Benefit Plans,
the assets of any of the trusts under such plans, the plan sponsor or the plan
administrator, or against any fiduciary of the Employee Benefit Plans with
respect to the operation of such plans (other than routine benefit claims) and
the investment of assets of such Plans, including any investigation or review
by the IRS, Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
nor does the Combined Company or any ERISA Affiliate have knowledge of facts
which could reasonably be expected to form the basis for any such claim,
lawsuit, arbitration, governmental or other proceeding or investigation.

                  (h)      Neither the Combined Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has: (i) withdrawn in a complete or partial withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan prior to the PRE-CLOSING DATE; (ii) incurred any liability
due to the termination or reorganization of a Multiemployer Plan; (iii)
terminated any "Pension Plan", as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, or filed a
notice of termination with respect to any Pension Plan; or (iv) received a
notice of termination issued by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
pursuant to Section 4042 of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan. With
respect to the Pension Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, if any, there are
no "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" as defined in Section 4001(a)(18)
of ERISA, there has been no "reportable event" as that term is defined in
Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder which would require the
giving of notice or any event requiring disclosure under Section 4041(c)(3)(C)
or 4063(a) of ERISA, and all premiums due the PBGC have been paid in full. No
Pension Plan which is subject to Part III of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" as
defined in Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA and Section 412(a)(2) of the Code
whether or not waived.

                  (i)      The Pension Plans are intended to qualify under
Section 401 of the Code and have received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service that the Pension Plans satisfy the
requirements of Section 401 of the Code and the related trusts maintained
pursuant thereto are exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of
the Code, and nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of Pension
Plans which could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption.

                  (j)      Neither the Combined Company nor any ERISA

         6.9      LICENSES.

                  (a)      Each of LLC and LLC Subsidiary has all governmental
licenses, permits, approvals, authorizations, exemptions, classifications,
registrations and certificates, and all consents or agreements with
governmental authorities (collectively, "LICENSES") necessary to conduct its
business in

                                    -35-

the manner and to the extent that it has been conducted, except where the
failure to possess such Licenses would not have a material adverse effect on
such Company. All of the Licenses and the parties thereto are listed on the
LLC Disclosure Schedule. The LLC Disclosure Schedule also lists every
application for any new License as well as for the renewal or modification of
any existing License. The Companies have made available to UbiquiTel true and
complete copies of all of the Licenses. All Licenses are in full force and
effect, and, to LLC's knowledge, no event has occurred that may constitute or
result in a material violation of the terms and conditions of any License, or
result in the revocation, suspension, material adverse modification or
nonrenewal of any License. No Company has received any written notice of or
has any knowledge of any actual, alleged or potential violation, revocation,
suspension, modification or nonrenewal of any License.

                  (b)      LLC has made all material filings required by any
and all federal, state and local governmental authorities (including, without
limitation, as appropriate, the FCC and the California Public Utilities
Commission), as are necessary to own, lease, license and operate its
respective properties and to conduct its business, including the planned
build-out of the PCS telecommunications network, as described in the Sprint
Affiliation Agreement. There is not pending or, to LLC's knowledge, threatened
any petition, complaint, investigation or other proceeding by or before any
federal, state or local governmental authority with respect to LLC or the
Licenses.

                  (c)      The Licenses for PCS (the "PCS LICENSES") are not
subject to any conditions other than those conditions listed thereon and those
conditions generally applicable to entities holding similar licenses issued by
the FCC. The PCS Licenses for F Block Spectrum expire on April 28, 2007, the
five-year build-out period for the PCS Licenses expires on April 28, 2002, and
the ten-year build-out period for the PCS Licenses expires on April 28, 2007.
The PCS License for A Block Spectrum expires on December 14, 2004. The PCS
Licenses have been granted pursuant to one or more public notices that have
become "final" (meaning that all applicable administrative and judicial
appeal, review and reconsideration periods of the orders granting the PCS
Licenses have expired, without the timely filing of any such appeal or request
for review or reconsideration and without the FCC's having instituted review
of the grant of the PCS Licenses on its own motion).

                  (d)      LLC's FCC Licenses (including the PCS Licenses)
constitute all of the licenses, permits, consents or authorizations required
by the FCC to permit LLC to operate its PCS telecommunications network and to
conduct its business, including the Build-Out Plan of the PCS
telecommunications network, as described in the Sprint Affiliation Agreement.
All fees due and payable to governmental authorities, including, but not
limited to, any required by the FCC in connection with the PCS Licenses, such
as down payments or installment payments required by FCC rules to be paid as
of the date hereof, as well as applicable payments to the Telecommunications
Relay Service Fund, Universal Service Fund, Regulatory Assessments fees, and
any such other payment obligations imposed by governmental authorities, have
been fully paid (other than the Installment Payment Plan promissory notes in
favor of the FCC in the amount set forth in the Company's unaudited financial
statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2000).

                  (e)      All completed and planned development,
implementation, construction and operation of the telecommunications network
pursuant to the PCS Licenses comply in all material respects with all
currently applicable telecommunications statutes or published regulations,
including, without limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by
the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and all published FCC rules, regulations,
and orders currently in effect.

                  (f)      LLC has provided notification to licensed operators
of Fixed Microwave Services as required by Section 101.103 of the FCC's rules
(47 C.F.R. Section 101.103). Except as set forth on the LLC Disclosure
Schedule, neither LLC nor any Member has received any notice of or has any
obligations to

                                    -36-

<PAGE>

reimburse any third party for any relocation expenses required under Section
24.239 through 24.253 of the FCC's rules (47 C.F.R. Sections 24.239 - 24.253).

                  (g)      There are no material violations of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or any published FCC rules or
regulations, or of any other state or local laws, published rules, or
regulations, with respect to the Licenses, and the Licenses have been duly
issued under the Communications Act and the FCC's rules and regulations and
are in force and in effect. There is no outstanding adverse decree, order, or
other ruling that has been issued by the FCC or any other governmental entity
against LLC or any Member or any other party with respect to the Licenses, and
there is no complaint, investigation, proceeding, petition, notice of
violation, notice of apparent liability, or mutually exclusive application
pending or, to LLC's knowledge, threatened, by or before the FCC or any other
administrative or governmental body, court or arbitrator against LLC or any
Member or any other party with respect to the Licenses. To LLC's knowledge no
event has occurred that would permit or warrant the FCC to commence revocation
proceedings or otherwise terminate the Licenses, or which would materially
adversely affect any of the rights of LLC or its Members thereunder.

                  (h)      As of January 31, 2001, the principal balances
owing on each of the Installment Payment Plan promissory notes made by Central
Wireless Partnership in favor of the FCC and assigned by Central Wireless
Partnership to LLC is $6,360,574.86, the interest rate is 6.25 percent per
annum, and the suspension interest owing is $0. Except for the encumbrances
resulting from the promissory notes in favor of the FCC, the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, and all applicable FCC's rules, regulations and
policies promulgated thereunder, on a license of the type held by LLC or any
Member, the Licenses are and will at the CLOSING be unencumbered and free of
any liens, charges or defects.

         6.10     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (a)      ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

Hazardous Materials (as hereinafter defined) on or from the Leased Premises.
Neither LLC nor LLC Subsidiary has received any written communication from any
Person that alleges that any Company is not in compliance with any Environmental
Law. Neither LLC nor, to LLC's knowledge, any of the Lessors or other occupants,
have released or discharged from or on to the Leased Premises any Hazardous
Materials or any toxic wastes, substances or materials (including, without
limitation, asbestos). LLC has no knowledge that any underground or above-ground
chemical treatment or storage tanks or gas or oil wells are located on the
Leased Premises. As used herein, the term "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS" means the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act and other federal laws governing the
environment as in effect on the date of this Agreement, together with their
implementing regulations, guidelines, rules or orders as of the date of this
Agreement, and all state, regional, county, municipal and other local laws,
regulations, ordinances and rules that are equivalent or similar to the federal
laws recited above or that purport to regulate Hazardous Materials, and, in
addition, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969. As used herein, the term "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS" means
petroleum, including crude oil or any fraction thereof, natural gas, natural gas
liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usable for fuel (or mixtures of
natural gas or such synthetic gas), and any substance, material, waste,

                  (b)      ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

         There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to LLC's knowledge,
threatened (A) against any Company, or (B) against any Person whose liability
for any Environmental Claim any Company has or may have retained or assumed
either contractually or by operation of law. As used herein, "ENVIRONMENTAL
CLAIM" means any and all written administrative, regulatory or judicial actions,

authority alleging potential liability (including, without limitation, potential
liability for enforcement, investigatory costs, cleanup costs, governmental
response costs, removal costs, remedial costs, natural resources damages,
property damages, personal injuries, or penalties) arising out of, based on or
resulting from (A) the presence, or release or threatened release into the
environment of any hazardous material or pollutant at any location, or (B) any
violation, or alleged violation, of any Environmental Law.

                  (c)      PERMITS.

         Each Company has obtained all permits and authorizations relating to
Environmental Laws necessary to operate its business, except for those permits
the failure of which to obtain would not cause a material adverse effect.

         6.11     NO BROKERS FEES; NO COMMISSIONS.

         All negotiations relative hereto and the transactions contemplated
hereby have been carried on by the LLC Parties directly with UbiquiTel and the
Merger Subs without any act by any Company that would give rise to any claim
against any Company, UbiquiTel, the Merger Subs or their respective Affiliates
for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other similar payment.

         6.12     CERTAIN INFORMATION.

         None of the information supplied or to be supplied by LLC specifically
for inclusion in (i) the Form S-4 or Form S-1 (as defined in Section 11.2(c)
(FORM S-1) hereof), as applicable, will, at the time the Form S-4 or Form S-1,

                                    ARTICLE 7
   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE MEMBERS AND THE STOCKHOLDERS

         In this Article 7, each Member and the Stockholder or Stockholders
owning equity in such Member are referred to collectively as a "STOCKHOLDER
GROUP." Additionally, for purposes of this Article 7 and Section 12.2(a)(ii)
(STOCKHOLDER GROUPS' INDEMNIFICATION) herein only, and in the case of an Evans
Merger only, except as otherwise stated herein, the Controlling Evans
Stockholders collectively shall be deemed to comprise a Stockholder Group, each
Controlling Evans Stockholder shall be deemed to be a Stockholder herein, and
Evans shall be deemed to be a Member; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that except as set
forth in Section 7.6 (SALE OF EVANS TELCO BUSINESSES) herein, no representation
or warranty is being made in this Agreement, including without limitation, this
Article 7, with respect to the Evans Telco Businesses. For purposes of this
Article 7, the representations and warranties made with respect to any one
Stockholder Group shall be deemed to be made jointly and severally by the
members of such Stockholder Group, and the representations and warranties made
with respect to a Member or a Stockholder in this Article 7 shall be deemed to
be made jointly and severally only by the Stockholder Group to which such Member
or Stockholder belongs. The representations and warranties made herein with
respect to the members of more than one Stockholder Group shall be deemed to be
made by each Stockholder Group severally, and not jointly with other Stockholder
Groups. Subject to the foregoing and Article 12 (INDEMNIFICATION) hereof, the
Members and the Stockholders represent and warrant to UbiquiTel and the Merger
Subs that, except as specifically set forth on the disclosure schedule to this
Article 7, which shall be organized by section and sub-section numbers

         7.1      STOCKHOLDERS; ENTRY INTO AGREEMENTS.

                  (a)      ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.

         Each member of each Stockholder Group (a "STOCKHOLDER ENTITY") that is
not a natural person is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
the State of California, is in good standing under such laws, and has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate all properties and
assets owned or leased by it and to conduct its business as previously and
currently conducted by it. Each Stockholder Entity is qualified to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it is required to be so
qualified, except where the lack of such qualification would not have a material
adverse effect on such Stockholder Entity. The Stockholders Disclosure Schedule
lists all jurisdictions in which any Stockholder Entity is qualified to do
business as a foreign entity and indicates which of the Stockholder Entities is
so qualified in each such jurisdiction. The Stockholders Disclosure Schedule
also lists, for each Stockholder Entity, the names of the Persons owning 10% or
more of the equity of such Stockholder Entity and the percentage owned by each
such Person. Each Member has made available to UbiquiTel a true and correct copy
of its Organizational Documents and minute books.

                  (b)      VALIDITY AND AUTHORIZATION; POWER AND AUTHORITY.

         Each Member and Stockholder, as applicable, has full power and
authority to consummate the Merger to which it is a party and to execute,
deliver and perform this Agreement, the Related Agreements and the other
instruments called for hereby or thereby to which it is a party. This Agreement
and the Related Agreements to which a Stockholder Entity is a party have been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by each such Stockholder Entity and
constitute (or, in the case of Related Agreements or instruments called for
hereby or thereby to be executed by a Stockholder Entity at or before the
CLOSING, upon execution will constitute) the legal, valid and binding obligation
of such Stockholder Entity enforceable against such Stockholder Entity in
accordance with their respective terms.

<PAGE>


                  (c)      NO CONFLICT.

         Except as set forth in the Stockholders Disclosure Schedule, neither

Agreements, nor the consummation of the Mergers or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will (i) result in any violation of the terms of, (ii)
contravene or conflict with, (iii) accelerate the performance of the obligations
required under, (iv) constitute a default under, (v) give any right of

debenture, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, License, judgment, decree,
order, law, rule or regulation or other restriction applicable to any
Stockholder Entity or to which any Stockholder Entity is a party or by which any
Stockholder Entity or its property or assets are bound or affected that, in any
such case, will result in a material adverse effect on any Member or any
Stockholder.

                  (d)      LLC PARTIES CONSENTS; STOCKHOLDERS CONSENTS NOT
                           REQUIRED.

         The Stockholders Disclosure Schedule lists all LLC Parties Consents for
which filing or other action is required by a Member. Subject to Section 2.1(f),
each Member has taken or shall have taken prior to the PRE-CLOSING DATE all
other actions necessary for the consummation by such Member of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements. No approval, filing,
consent, permit, for which filing or other action is required by any Stockholder
is required for the valid execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
and the Related Agreements or the consummation of the Mergers, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

                  (e)      OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER OF MEMBERS' INTERESTS.

         Each Member represents that it has good, valid and marketable title to
the units of Members' Interests owned by it, free and clear of any Liens. Each
Member represents that it is not a party to any contract, agreement or
understanding (other than this Agreement) relating to the issuance, sale,
redemption, purchase, repurchase, acquisition or other transfer or voting of any
units of Members' Interests or any other equity security of any Company, other
than LLC's Operating Agreement. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will transfer to UbiquiTel indirect ownership of all of the
Members' Interests of LLC free and clear of all Liens.

         7.2      FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

                  (a)      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; BOOKS AND RECORDS.

         Attached to the Stockholders Disclosure Schedule are true and correct
copies of (i) the balance sheets for each of the Members (other than the Selling
Member) as of the close of each such Member's most recent fiscal year, and the
related statement of profit and loss and cash flows for the periods then ended,
including any audit and it reports thereon that have been rendered with respect
to such financial statements, (ii) the unaudited balance sheet for each Member
at September 30, 2000, and the related statement of profit and loss for the nine
month period then ended, and (iii) when delivered pursuant hereto, similar
financial statements for each additional month ending after the date hereof
(such financial statements of a Stockholder Entity being referred to herein as
the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). Each Member's Financial Statements fairly present
the financial position of the Member to which it pertains as of the dates
thereof and the results of such Member's operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended, in accordance with GAAP, except for the variances from GAAP
set forth in the notes to such Member's Financial Statements, subject, in the
case of such Member's Financial Statements listed in items (ii) and (iii) of the
immediately-preceding paragraph, to normal recurring period-end adjustments and

                                    -40-

<PAGE>


absence of notes and a statement of cash flows in each case that, if presented,
would not differ materially from those included in the financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year of each such Member.

                  (b)      CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

         Each Member (i) does not conduct, and has never conducted, any business
of any nature whatsoever except for (A) holding its Member Interest in LLC and
(B) those businesses specifically described on the Stockholders Disclosure
Schedule, and (ii) does not have any assets (other than its Member Interest).

         7.3      EQUITY INTERESTS.

                  (a)      CAPITALIZATION.

         The authorized, issued and outstanding equity interests of each Member
are as set forth in the Stockholders Disclosure Schedule. There are no other
equity interests of any Member either authorized or outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding equity interests of each Member have been duly authorized
and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, and are free and clear of
any preemptive rights. There are no outstanding preemptive, conversion or other
rights, or other options, warrants or agreements granted by, issued by, or
binding upon, any Member for the issuance, sale, purchase, repurchase,
redemption, acquisition or other transfer of any equity interests or securities
of any Member. Immediately prior to the Effective Date of the Merger to which it
is a party, no Stockholder shall have the right to assert dissenters' or
appraisal rights under applicable state law (or if such dissenters' or appraisal
rights exist, each Stockholder shall have waived such rights), or otherwise have
the right to demand cash or other payment for Stock in connection with such
Merger, other than the Merger Consideration to be received by such Stockholder.

                  (b)      OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER BY STOCKHOLDERS.

         Each Stockholder represents that it has good, valid and marketable
title to the equity interests of the Member owned by it, free and clear of any
Liens, and upon consummation of the Mergers contemplated hereby, UbiquiTel or
the Merger Subs, as the case may be, will collectively own all of the
outstanding Member Interests. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will transfer to UbiquiTel all of the shares of Stock or other
equity interest of each Member.

         7.4      NO CONTRACTS.

         No Member is or has ever been a party to, nor are any assets of any
Member subject or ever been subject to, any Contract or agreement.

         7.5      LIABILITIES.

                  (a)      NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.

         Except as set forth or reserved against in full in the most recent
Financial Statements, no Member has any debt, guaranty, liability or obligation
of any nature, whether known or unknown, accrued, absolute, contingent,
determined or determinable or otherwise, whether due or to become due, and to
each Member's knowledge, there is no basis for the assertion against it of any
such debt, guaranty, liability or obligation.

                  (b)      TAX MATTERS.

                           (i)      All material Tax Returns required to be
filed by or on behalf of the Member or any of its subsidiaries or any Affiliated
Group of which the Member or any of its subsidiaries was a member have been
properly prepared and timely filed with the appropriate taxing authorities in
all jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (after
giving effect to any valid extensions of time in which to make such filings) and
all such Tax Returns were true, complete and correct in all material respects.

                           (ii)     All Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) payable by or on behalf of the Member or any of its subsidiaries either
directly, as part of the consolidated Tax Returns of another taxpayer, or
otherwise have been fully and timely paid, including all required estimated tax
payments sufficient to avoid any understatement penalties. The cash reserves or
accruals for Taxes provided in the books and records of the Member with respect
to any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed or for which Taxes
are not yet due and owing are, or prior to the EFFECTIVE DATE, will be,
sufficient for all unpaid Taxes of the Member through and including the
EFFECTIVE DATE (including, without limitation, with respect to any Taxes
resulting from the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Other than as
provided on the Stockholders Disclosure Schedule, neither the Member nor any of
its subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any other person as a
transferee, successor, by contract or otherwise, except with respect to Taxes
for which withholding may be required and has been made. There are no Liens as a
result of any unpaid Taxes upon any of the assets of the Member or any of its
subsidiaries.

                           (iii)    Neither the Member nor any of its
subsidiaries has executed or filed with the Internal Revenue Service or any
other taxing authority any agreement, waiver or other document or arrangement
extending or having the effect of extending the period for assessment or
collection of Taxes (including, but not limited to, any applicable statute of
limitation), and no power of attorney with respect to any Tax matter is
currently in force. Neither the Member nor any of its subsidiaries is the
subject of any private letter ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or
comparable rulings of other taxing authorities.

                           (iv)     The Member and each of its subsidiaries has
complied in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes on amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other
third party and has duly and timely withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authorities all Taxes with respect to such amounts.

                           (v)      All deficiencies asserted or assessments
made as a result of any examinations by the Internal Revenue Service or any
other taxing authority of the Tax Returns of or covering or including the Member
or any of its subsidiaries have been fully paid, and there are no other audits
or investigations by any taxing authority or proceedings in progress, nor have
the Stockholders, the Member or any of its subsidiaries received any notice from
any taxing authority that it intends to conduct such an audit or investigation.
No issue has been raised by a U.S. federal, state, local or foreign taxing
authority in any current or prior examination which, by application of the same
or similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a proposed
material deficiency for any subsequent taxable period. No claim has been made by
a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Member or any of its subsidiaries
does not file Tax Returns such that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.

                           (vi)     Neither the Member, nor any member of the
Member's Affiliated Group (including any of the Stockholders) on behalf of the
Member, has (A) agreed to or is required to make any adjustments pursuant to
Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law by reason of a change in accounting method initiated by the Member, or has
any application pending with

                                    -42-

<PAGE>

any taxing authority requesting permission for any changes in accounting
methods that relate to the business or operations of the Member or any of its
subsidiaries, or has otherwise taken any action that would have the effect of
deferring any liability for Taxes from any taxable period ending on or before
the EFFECTIVE DATE to any taxable period ending thereafter or (B) executed or
entered into a closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any
predecessor provision thereof or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law with respect to the Member or any of its subsidiaries.

                           (vii)    Except for this Agreement, as provided in
the Stockholders Disclosure Schedule, and the Operating Agreement, neither the
Member nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any tax-sharing or similar
agreement or arrangement (whether or not written) pursuant to which it will have
any obligation to make any payments after the EFFECTIVE DATE.

                           (viii)   There is no contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement covering any person that, individually or collectively, could give
rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by UbiquiTel or
any of its Affiliates by reason of Section 280G of the Code, or would constitute
compensation in excess of the limitation set forth in Section 162(m) of the
Code.

                           (ix)     The Member and each of its subsidiaries has
substantial authority for the treatment of or has disclosed (in accordance with
Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code) on its federal income Tax Returns all
positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of
federal income tax within the meaning of Section 6662(d) of the Code.

                  (c)      LITIGATION.

         There is no pending Proceeding that has been received or commenced by
or against any Stockholder Entity that otherwise relates to or may affect the
Mergers, the Interest Sale, this Agreement, any Related Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein or therein, nor, to each Member's knowledge,
have any such Proceedings been threatened.

         7.6      SALE OF EVANS TELCO BUSINESSES.

                  (e)      REORGANIZATION QUALIFICATION.

         The Mergers (except the Evans Merger) are intended to qualify as
reorganizations pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E) of the Code. The
Stockholders and UbiquiTel Parent shall take the position on all Tax Returns
that, for all purposes, such Mergers qualify as reorganizations within the
meaning of such Code sections. Further, UbiquiTel Parent and the Stockholders
agree that they will report such Mergers accordingly and that they will not take
any action which is reasonably likely to be considered to be inconsistent with
such reporting positions.

                  (f)      QUALIFICATION OF THE EVANS MERGER.

         The Evans Merger is intended to be treated as a purchase by UbiquiTel
Parent of all of the outstanding capital stock of Evans. The Evans Stockholders
and UbiquiTel Parent shall take the position on all Tax Returns that, for all
purposes, the Evans Merger is so treated. Further, UbiquiTel Parent and the
Evans Stockholders agree that they will report such Merger accordingly and that
they will not take any action which is reasonably likely to be considered to be
inconsistent with such reporting position.

         11.5     PAYOFF OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AT CLOSING.

         Immediately following the CLOSING, UbiquiTel shall pay in full all
amounts of principal and accrued but unpaid interest of LLC to RTFC under the
RTFC Loan Agreement, and shall receive in return from the RTFC, in form and
substance satisfactory to counsel for UbiquiTel and the LLC Parties, all
documents (including without limitation UCC-3 termination statements executed by
RTFC and otherwise prepared for filing) necessary to release and fully terminate
the rights, liens and security interests of RTFC or any Persons claiming through
RTFC in connection with the RTFC Loan Agreement. In connection with such
payment, UbiquiTel shall cooperate with the LLC Parties with respect to releases
of any and all guaranties or pledges given by the LLC Parties and the return of
any and all collateral properly belonging to such Parties.

         11.6     TAX MATTERS FOR UBIQUITEL PARENT AND MEMBERS.

         Except as expressly provided otherwise in Section 11.7 with respect to
the Evans Merger, the following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between UbiquiTel Parent, the Members, and the Stockholders
for certain tax matters following the PRE-CLOSING Date or the CLOSING DATE, as
applicable:

                  (a)      TAX PERIODS ENDING ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE.

         The Stockholder of each Member (in the case of PCS, IPLLC, and in the
case of Kerman, KCI), or any designated representative thereof, shall have the
obligation to prepare all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the income, assets, or operations of that Stockholder's affiliated
Member for all taxable years or other taxable periods ending on or prior to the
CLOSING DATE with respect to that Member (a "MEMBER PRE-CLOSING PERIOD"). Each
such Tax Return shall be submitted to UbiquiTel Parent at least 30 days prior to
filing for approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Except as
provided in this Section 11.6 and in Section 11.7 with respect to the Evans
Merger, UbiquiTel Parent shall have the exclusive obligation and authority to
timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to the income, assets or operations of a Member or any
successor thereto, LLC and LLC Subsidiary.

                  (b)      STRADDLE PERIODS.

         UbiquiTel Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed any Tax Returns of LLC, LLC Subsidiary, and each Member for
Tax periods that begin before the CLOSING DATE and end after the CLOSING DATE
(the "STRADDLE PERIODS"). All such Tax Returns prepared by UbiquiTel Parent
shall be submitted to the Stockholders (in the case of PCS, IPLLC, and in the
case of Kerman, KCI) of each respective Member at least thirty (30) days prior
to the filing of such Tax Return for approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. For purposes of this Section 11.6(b), in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable
period ending on the CLOSING DATE shall (A) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the CLOSING DATE,
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the case of real or personal property Taxes,
UbiquiTel Parent shall bear any supplemental or additional assessments that
result from the Mergers (except the Evans Merger), and (B) in the case of any
Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the CLOSING DATE.
Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the
CLOSING DATE shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period
ended on the CLOSING DATE. For purposes of Section 11.6(c), the portion of any
Member's Straddle Period that ends on or before the CLOSING DATE shall be
treated as a Member PRE-CLOSING Period.

                  (c)      TAX OBLIGATIONS.

                           (i)      Each Stockholder Group shall be
responsible for, and shall pay or cause to be paid to or for the benefit of
UbiquiTel Parent and its subsidiaries, any and all Taxes that may be imposed
upon or assessed against or otherwise determined to be attributable to its
affiliated Member or its assets: (i) with respect to any Member PRE-CLOSING
Period, (ii) arising by reason of any breach or inaccuracy of the
representations contained in Sections 6.5(b) or 7.5(b) hereof, (iii) with
respect to any and all Taxes of any member of an Affiliated Group, as defined
in Section 11.6(g)(i), of which a Member is or was a member on or prior to the
CLOSING DATE, including any Taxes for which the Member may be

                                    -52-

<PAGE>

liable under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (iv) by
reason of being a successor-in-interest or transferee of another Person on or
prior to the CLOSING DATE, and (v) without duplication, with respect to any
Taxes incurred by the Member, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (subject to clause (A) of Section 11.6(b) (STRADDLE PERIODS)
hereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Members shall not be responsible
for any additions to Tax, interest or penalties arising from UbiquiTel
Parent's negligence in filing of any Tax Returns timely submitted or UbiquiTel
Parent's late payment of any Taxes with respect to which funds were made
available for timely payment by the Members. For purposes of this Agreement,
the federal, state and local income Tax liabilities attributable to any
Stockholder, Member or its subsidiaries for any Member PRE-CLOSING Period
shall be computed without taking into account (A) any item of loss, deduction,
credit, refund, loss carryback or similar item that is attributable to
UbiquiTel Parent or its subsidiaries; or (B) any item of loss, deduction,
credit, refund, loss carryback or similar item that is attributable to LLC or
LLC Subsidiary for any Tax period or portion of a Tax period subsequent to the
PRE-CLOSING DATE.

                           (ii)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Section 11.6(b), Section 11.6(c)(i), Section 11.6(g), or the Operating
Agreement, UbiquiTel Parent, but not the Members, shall be responsible for
payment of any Taxes to the extent such Taxes result from any Tax items
(whether incurred in the ordinary course of business or otherwise) of LLC that
arise after the PRE-CLOSING DATE. Furthermore, Tax items of LLC that arise
from transactions not in the ordinary course of business and not contemplated
by this Agreement and the Related Agreements that occur on or after the
PRE-CLOSING DATE shall be deemed to arise after the Effective Date.

                  (d)      GENERAL COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS.

                           (i)      UbiquiTel Parent, the Members, and each of
the Stockholders shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Section 11.6 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Party's request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder. Each Member
agrees (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Member or its Stockholders relating to any taxable period beginning
before the CLOSING DATE, until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by UbiquiTel Parent or a Stockholder, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to
give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, to
allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records. UbiquiTel
Parent, the Members and each of the Stockholders acknowledge that any and all
information obtained in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit
or judicial or administrative proceeding or determination pursuant to this
Section 11.6 is of a confidential nature and that all such information shall be
used only for the purposes set forth in this Section 11.6.

                           (ii)     So long as such action would not create any
material liability for such Party, UbiquiTel Parent and each Stockholder further
agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on a
Member (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

                           (iii)    UbiquiTel Parent and each Stockholder
further agree, upon request, to provide the other Party with all information
that either Party may be required to report pursuant to Section 6043

                                    -53-

<PAGE>

of the Code and all Treasury Department Regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (e)      CONTESTS.

                           (i)      Each Member's Stockholder (in the case of
PCS, IPLLC, and in the case of Kerman, KCI) and their duly appointed
representatives (collectively, the "MEMBER REPRESENTATIVE") shall have the
authority to control any audit or examination by any taxing authority, and
contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice
of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to any liability
of a Member for its Member PRE-CLOSING Periods; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
Member Representative shall, without the prior consent of UbiquiTel Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, enter into any settlement of
any contest or otherwise compromise any issue that would have a material adverse
effect on the Tax benefits of UbiquiTel Parent or the Member for taxable years
ending after the CLOSING DATE. UbiquiTel Parent and its duly appointed
Representatives shall have the exclusive authority to control any audit or
examination by any taxing authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any
Tax Return and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional
Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to
any liability of a Member for Taxes for any taxable year or other taxable period
ending after the CLOSING DATE (a "MEMBER POST-CLOSING PERIOD"); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (a) neither UbiquiTel Parent nor its subsidiaries nor any of their
duly appointed Representatives shall, without the prior written consent of the
Member Representative, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise
compromise any issue that adversely affects the liability of the Member's
Stockholder or Stockholders for any Member PRE-CLOSING Period Taxes, and (b)
neither UbiquiTel Parent nor its subsidiaries nor any of their duly appointed
representatives shall, without the prior consent of the Member Representative,
enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise compromise any issue that
would require payment by such Member Representative's Stockholder Group
Indemnitors of any amount under this Agreement unless UbiquiTel Parent shall
have waived or caused to be waived for itself and its subsidiaries any right to
indemnification for Taxes from such Member Representative's Stockholder Group
Indemnitors.

                           (ii)     UbiquiTel Parent agrees to notify in writing
the Member Representative of any affected Member within ten business days of
receipt of any notice, whether oral or in writing, of any federal, state, local
or foreign Tax examinations, claims, settlements, proposed adjustments, or
related matters that may affect in any way such Member Representative's
Stockholder Group Indemnitors' obligations under this Agreement and shall
promptly forward all written notifications and other communications from any Tax
authority received by UbiquiTel relating to any Tax audit or other proceeding
relating to the Tax liability of or with respect to a Member. The failure of
UbiquiTel Parent to give the Member Representative such written notice shall not
excuse such Member Representative's Stockholder Group Indemnitors from their
obligations under this Agreement with respect to any increased Tax liability
directly or indirectly attributable to any such written notification or other
communication, unless such failure materially prejudices the ability of the
Member Representative's Stockholder Group to defend or dispute such examination,
claim, settlement, adjustment or related matter.

                           (iii)    This Section 11.6(e) shall be subject to the
provisions of Article 12 of this Agreement.

                  (f)      [OMITTED].

                  (g)      ADDITIONAL TAX MATTERS.

                           (i)      TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS.

         Any Tax sharing agreement (other than the Operating Agreement) to which
the LLC, LLC

                                    -54-

<PAGE>

Subsidiary, or a Member is a party hereby is terminated as of the CLOSING DATE
and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current
year, a future year, or a past year). For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"AFFILIATED GROUP" means an affiliated group within the meaning of Code
Section 1504(a), and when used with respect to a Member, means the Affiliated
Group to which such Member belongs.

                           (ii)     RETURNS FOR PERIODS THROUGH THE CLOSING
                                    DATE.

         Each respective corporate Stockholder ("PARENT") of each respective
Member will include the income of the Member (including any deferred income
triggered into income by Reg. Section 1.1502-13 and Reg. Section 1.1502-14 and
the excess loss accounts taken into income under Reg. Section 1.1502-19) on
each such Parent's consolidated federal income Tax Returns for all periods
through the CLOSING DATE and pay any federal income Taxes attributable to such
income. Each Member will furnish Tax information to its respective Parent for
inclusion in such Parent's federal consolidated income Tax Return for the
period which includes the CLOSING DATE. Each Parent will allow UbiquiTel
Parent an opportunity to review and comment upon such Tax Returns (including
any amended returns) to the extent that they relate to a Member. Parent will
take no position on such returns that relate to a Member that would adversely
affect the Member after the CLOSING DATE unless such position would be
reasonable in the case of a Person that owned the Member both before and after
the CLOSING DATE. The income of each Member will be apportioned to the period
up to and including the CLOSING DATE and the period after the CLOSING DATE, by
closing the books of the Member as of the close of business on the CLOSING
DATE.

                           (iii)    CARRYBACKS.

         With respect to any post acquisition Tax attributes for which UbiquiTel
Parent cannot waive a carryback, each Parent will pay to UbiquiTel Parent within
ten (10) days any Tax refund (or reduction in Tax liability) resulting from a
carryback of a post-acquisition Tax attribute of its former Member into the
Parent's consolidated Tax Return, when such refund or reduction is realized by
Parent. Each Parent will cooperate with its former Member in obtaining such
refunds (or reduction in Tax liability), including through the filing of amended
Tax Returns or refund claims. UbiquiTel Parent agrees to indemnify each Parent
for any Taxes resulting from the disallowance of such post-acquisition Tax
attribute on audit or otherwise.

                           (iv)     RETENTION OF CARRYOVERS.

         No Parent will elect to retain any net operating loss carryovers or
capital loss carryovers of its Member under Reg. Section 1.1502-20(g). At any
Parent's request, UbiquiTel Parent will cause such Parent's former Member to
join with Parent in filing any necessary elections under Reg.
Section 1.1502-20(g).

                           (v)      POST-CLOSING ELECTIONS.

         At any Parent's request, UbiquiTel Parent will cause such Parent's
former Member to make and/or join with Parent in making any election after the
CLOSING if the making of such election does not have a material adverse impact
on UbiquiTel Parent or such Parent's former Member for any post-acquisition Tax
period.

         11.7     TAX MATTERS IN EVANS MERGER.

         Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, Section 7.5(b)), if the Evans Merger occurs, the following
provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between UbiquiTel
Parent, Evans and the Evans Stockholders for certain tax matters following the
PRE-CLOSING DATE or the CLOSING DATE, as applicable.

                                    -55-

<PAGE>

                  (a)      TAX PERIODS ENDING ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE.

         The Evans Representative shall have the obligation to prepare all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the income, assets,
or operations of Evans and its subsidiaries for all taxable years or other
taxable periods ending on or prior to the CLOSING DATE (the "EVANS PRE-CLOSING
PERIODS"). Each such Tax Return shall be submitted to UbiquiTel Parent at least
30 days prior to filing for approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, UbiquiTel Parent shall have the
exclusive obligation and authority to timely file or cause to be timely filed
all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the income,
assets or operations of Evans or any successor thereto.

                  (b)      EVANS STRADDLE PERIODS.

         UbiquiTel Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed any Tax Returns of Evans or its subsidiaries for taxable years
or taxable periods which begin before the CLOSING DATE and end after the CLOSING
DATE ("EVANS STRADDLE PERIODS"). UbiquiTel Parent shall furnish to the Evans
Representative for review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, a draft of each such Tax Return that UbiquiTel Parent proposes to file
at least 30 days prior to the filing of such return. For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are
payable for an Evans Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to
the portion of such taxable period ending on the CLOSING DATE shall (x) in the
case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts,
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the CLOSING DATE and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the entire taxable period, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the case of real or
personal property Taxes, UbiquiTel Parent shall bear any supplemental or
additional assessments that result from the Evans Merger, and (y) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the
CLOSING DATE. Any credits relating to an Evans Straddle Period shall be taken
into account as though the relevant taxable period ended on the CLOSING DATE.
For purposes of Section 11.7(c), the portion of the Evans Straddle Period that
ends on or before the CLOSING DATE shall be treated as a Evans PRE-CLOSING
Period.

                  (c)      TAX OBLIGATIONS.

                           (i)      The Evans Stockholders shall be responsible
for, shall pay or cause to be paid and reimburse UbiquiTel Parent and its
subsidiaries for any and all Taxes that may be imposed upon or assessed against,
or otherwise determined to be attributable to Evans or its assets: (i) with
respect to any Evans PRE-CLOSING Period, (ii) arising by reason of any breach or
inaccuracy of the representations contained in Section 6.5(b) or 7.5(b) hereof,
(iii) with respect to any and all Taxes of any member of an Affiliated Group, as
defined in Section 11.6(g)(i), of which Evans or its subsidiaries are or was a
member on or prior to the Evans CLOSING DATE, including any Taxes for which
Evans or its subsidiaries may be liable under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law), (iv) by reason of being a successor-in-interest or transferee
of another Person on or prior to the CLOSING DATE, and (v) without duplication,
with respect to any Taxes incurred by Evans before the CLOSING DATE in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (subject to
clause (x) of the third sentence of Section 11.7(b) (STRADDLE PERIODS) hereof).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Evans Stockholders shall not be
responsible for any Taxes pursuant to this Section 11.7(c) to the extent such
Taxes have been paid on or before the CLOSING DATE or have been taken into
account in computing the Net Assets pursuant to Section 1.2(b)(ii)(B) or the Tax
Return adjustment amount payable pursuant to Section 1.2(b)(ii)(B)(III), and
(ii) the Evans Stockholders shall not be responsible for any additions to Tax,
interest or penalties arising from UbiquiTel Parent's

                                    -56-

<PAGE>

negligence in filing of any Tax Returns timely submitted by the Evans
Stockholders or UbiquiTel Parent's late payment of any Taxes with respect to
which funds were made available for the timely payment thereof under Section
1.2(b)(ii)(B)(III). For purposes of this Agreement, the federal, state and
local income Tax liabilities attributable to Evans or its subsidiaries for any
Evans PRE-CLOSING Period shall be computed without taking into account (A) any
item of loss, deduction, credit, refund, loss carryback or similar item that
is attributable to UbiquiTel Parent or its subsidiaries; and (B) any item of
loss, deduction, credit, refund, loss carryback or similar item that is
attributable to LLC or LLC Subsidiary for any Tax period or portion of a Tax
period subsequent to the PRE-CLOSING DATE.

                           (ii)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 11.7(b), Section 11.7(c)(i) or the Operating Agreement, UbiquiTel
Parent, but not the Evans Stockholders, shall be responsible for payment of any
Taxes to the extent such Taxes result from any Tax items (whether incurred in
the ordinary course of business or otherwise) of LLC that arise after the
PRE-CLOSING DATE. Furthermore, Tax items of LLC that arise from transactions not
in the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement and
the Related Agreements that occur on or after the PRE-CLOSING DATE shall be
deemed to arise after the Effective Date.

                  (d)      GENERAL COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS.

                           (i)      UbiquiTel Parent and the Evans
Representative agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising in
connection with the preparation or review of any Tax Return or the calculation
of any Tax described in this Section 11.7. After the Evans CLOSING, the Evans
Representative and UbiquiTel Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to provide the requesting Party or its designee with such assistance
as may reasonably be requested by such Party or its designee in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Return, audit or judicial or administrative
proceeding or determination relating to liability for Taxes of or with respect
to UbiquiTel Parent (relating to Evans or its subsidiaries), Evans, or any of
their Affiliates including access to the books and records, and the assistance
of the officers and employees of Evans and its subsidiaries. UbiquiTel Parent
and the Evans Stockholders acknowledge that any and all information obtained in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit, or judicial or
administrative proceeding or determination pursuant to this Section 11.7(d) is
of a confidential nature and that all such information shall be used only for
the purposes set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.

                           (ii)     So long as such action would not create any
material liability for such Party, UbiquiTel Parent and the Evans Representative
further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on a
Member (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

                           (iii)    UbiquiTel Parent and the Evans
Representative further agree, upon request, to provide the other Party with all
information that either Party may be required to report pursuant to Section 6043
of the Code and all Treasury Department Regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (e)      CONTESTS.

                           (i)      The Evans Representative and its duly
appointed representatives shall have the authority to control any audit or
examination by any taxing authority, and contest, resolve and defend against any
assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of
Taxes of or relating to any liability of Evans and its subsidiaries for all
Evans PRE-CLOSING Periods; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither the Evans
Representative nor any duly appointed representative of the Evans Representative
shall, without the prior consent of UbiquiTel Parent, which consent shall not be

                                    -57-

<PAGE>

unreasonably withheld, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise
compromise any issue that would have a material adverse effect on the Tax
benefits of UbiquiTel Parent or Evans or any subsidiary for taxable years ending
after the CLOSING DATE. UbiquiTel Parent and its duly appointed Representatives
shall have the exclusive authority to control any audit or examination by any
taxing authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any Tax Return and
contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice
of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to any liability
of Evans and its subsidiaries for Taxes for any taxable year or other taxable
period ending after the CLOSING DATE (the "POST-CLOSING PERIODS"); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (a) none of UbiquiTel Parent, Evans, its subsidiaries nor any of
their duly appointed representatives shall, without the prior written consent of
the Evans Representative, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise
compromise any issue that adversely affects the liability of the Evans
Stockholders for any Evans PRE-CLOSING Period Taxes, and (b) none of UbiquiTel
Parent, Evans, its subsidiaries nor any of their duly appointed representatives
shall, without the prior consent of the Evans Representative, enter into any
settlement of any contest or otherwise compromise any issue that would require
payment by the Controlling Evans Stockholders (as defined herein) of any amount
under this Agreement unless UbiquiTel Parent shall have waived or caused to be
waived for itself and Evans and its subsidiaries any right to indemnification
for Taxes from the Controlling Evans Stockholders.

                           (ii)     NOTICES. UbiquiTel Parent agrees to notify
the Evans Representative in writing within ten business days of receipt of any
notice, whether oral or in writing, of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax
examinations, claims, settlements, proposed adjustments, or related matters that
may affect in any way the Controlling Evans Stockholders' obligations under this
Agreement and shall promptly forward all written notifications and other
communications from any Tax authority received by such Party or, with respect to
UbiquiTel Parent, Evans or their respective subsidiaries relating to any Tax
audit or other proceeding relating to the Tax liability of or with respect to
Evans or its subsidiaries. The failure of UbiquiTel Parent to give the Evans
Representative such written notice shall not excuse the Controlling Evans
Stockholders from their obligations under this Agreement with respect to any
increased Tax liability directly or indirectly attributable to any such written
notification or other communication, unless such failure materially prejudices
the ability of the Evans Representative to defend or dispute such examination,
claim, settlement, adjustment or related matter.

                           (iii)    The provisions of this Section 11.7(e) shall
be subject to the provisions of Article 12 of this Agreement.

                  (f)      CARRYBACK CFT DEDUCTION.

         The federal income tax deduction for the California Franchise Tax (the
"CFT DEDUCTION") paid by Evans and its subsidiaries for the tax period ending on
the CLOSING DATE may be claimed as a deduction by UbiquiTel Parent on its
consolidated federal income Tax Return for the first tax period ending
subsequent to the CLOSING DATE in which such deduction may properly be claimed
(the "POST-ACQUISITION PERIOD"). If UbiquiTel Parent files a claim for a federal
income tax refund ("FIT REFUND") for a tax period of Evans and its subsidiaries
ending on or before the CLOSING DATE (an "EVANS PRE-ACQUISITION PERIOD") as a
result of a net operating loss carryback from the Post-Acquisition Period,
UbiquiTel Parent shall make a payment to the Evans Stockholders of 50% of any
such FIT Refund or part thereof attributable solely to the CFT Deduction (the
"CFT PAYMENT"). UbiquiTel Parent shall make the CFT payment, if any, within 60
days of, and only upon UbiquiTel Parent's actual receipt of, a FIT Refund
attributable to the CFT Deduction. UbiquiTel Parent's obligation to make any CFT
Payment shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions: (i)
UbiquiTel Parent shall be under no obligation, and the Evans Stockholders shall
have no right, to require UbiquiTel Parent to file any claim for refund or
amended returns relating to any Evans Pre-Acquisition Period; (ii) except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, UbiquiTel Parent may take any actions
following the CLOSING Date with

                                    -58-

<PAGE>

regard to the transfer of the ownership of Evans, its subsidiaries or their
assets, even if such actions preclude any carryback of any net operating
losses; (iii) any UbiquiTel Parent FIT Refund shall be considered attributable
to the CFT Deduction only to the extent of any additional FIT Refund received,
if any, as a result of and but for the CFT Deduction; (iv) the maximum amount
of any CFT Payment to the Evans Stockholders shall be $825,000; (v) UbiquiTel
Parent shall be indemnified by the Evans Stockholders pursuant to Article 12
for any CFT Payment made to the Evans Stockholders if any FIT Refund
attributable to the CFT Deduction is subsequently disallowed for any reason;
and (vi) UbiquiTel Parent shall have no obligation to make a CFT Payment if it
has not received a FIT Refund attributable to the CFT deduction on or before
December 31, 2005. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
UbiquiTel Parent shall not be obligated to make any other payment to the Evans
Stockholders as a result of any Tax refund claim filed with respect to any
Evans Pre-Acquisition Period to the extent that such Tax refund claim arises
from a net operating loss carryback from any Post-Acquisition Period.
UbiquiTel Parent shall notify the Evans Representative within 30 days of
filing a claim for an FIT Refund with respect to an Evans Pre-Acquisition
Period and whether such claim includes an FIT Refund attributable to the CFT
Deduction. If such a refund claim is filed, UbiquiTel Parent's Chief Financial
Officer shall provide a certification to the Evans Representative on each of
December 31, 2002, December 31, 2003, December 31, 2004, and December 31,
2005, as to whether or not UbiquiTel Parent has received an FIT Refund
attributable to the CFT Deduction.

         11.8     WAIVER OF PURCHASE RIGHTS BY MEMBERS.

         So long as this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
the provisions of Article 5 hereof, the Members waive any and all rights of
first refusal or other similar purchase rights with respect to LLC Interests
each such Member may have pursuant to the Operating Agreement, including,
without limitation, such rights as set forth in Article 12 thereof.

         11.9     RELEASE FROM STOCKHOLDER GUARANTEES.

         At the CLOSING, UbiquiTel Parent or UbiquiTel shall obtain the release
of the LLC Parties (and their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders and Affiliates) from the guarantees listed on SCHEDULE 11.9;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if UbiquiTel Parent or UbiquiTel is unable to obtain
such releases at the CLOSING, UbiquiTel Parent and/or UbiquiTel shall continue
to use commercially reasonable efforts (which efforts shall include having
UbiquiTel Parent or UbiquiTel named as a guarantor, if acceptable to the
respective creditors) to obtain such releases, and in any event shall indemnify
and hold harmless the LLC Parties (and their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders and Affiliates) against any liability with respect to
any such guarantees. Any indemnification amounts to be paid by UbiquiTel Parent
and/or UbiquiTel pursuant to this Section 11.9 shall be paid promptly upon
demand, without limitation or offset.

         11.10    FCC MATTERS.

         UbiquiTel shall be responsible for any unjust enrichment payment
required by Section 1.2111 of the FCC's rules with respect to the transfer of
the PCS Licenses from VIA to UbiquiTel.

         11.11    AMENDMENT OF DUE DILIGENCE SCHEDULES.

         LLC may, within three days next following the execution of this
Agreement, amend the LLC Disclosure Schedule (excluding Sections 6.5 and 6.10)
for additional disclosures not to exceed $1.0 million individually or in the
aggregate.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         12.1     SURVIVAL; ETC.

                  (a)      BREACH.

                  As used herein, a Party's "BREACH" shall mean (i) with respect
to any representation or warranty made in Sections 6 and 8 of this Agreement or
in any of the Related Agreements, such representation or warranty being untrue
as of the PRE-CLOSING DATE, (ii) with respect to any representation or warranty
made in Section 7 of this Agreement, such representation or warranty being
untrue as of the CLOSING DATE, and (ii) any breach of any of such Party's
covenants, agreements, or obligations under this Agreement or under any of the
Related Agreements. At the CLOSING, "Breach" shall also include any fact, event,
circumstance, or matter that causes a representation or warranty (i) made in
Sections 6 and 8 on the date of this Agreement to become untrue between the date
of this Agreement and the PRE-CLOSING DATE, or (ii) made in Section 7 on the
date of this Agreement to become untrue between the date of this Agreement and

accordance with the terms set forth in Article 5 hereof.

                  (b)      SURVIVAL.

         The representations and warranties of the Parties made in this
Agreement or any Related Agreement, and the indemnification obligations of the
Parties in connection with a Breach thereof, shall survive the CLOSING for the

WARRANTIES) below.

                  (c)      SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         If the CLOSING occurs, the representations and warranties set forth in
Article 6 (REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING LLC), and Article 8
(REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF UBIQUITEL PARENT, UBIQUITEL AND THE MERGER
SUBS) of this Agreement shall survive for twelve (12) months following the
PRE-CLOSING DATE, and the representations and warranties set forth in Article 7
(REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE MEMBERS AND STOCKHOLDERS) of this
Agreement shall survive for twelve (12) months following the Closing Date;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the representations, warranties, and covenants set
forth in Sections 6.5(b) (TAX MATTERS), 7.5(b) (TAX MATTERS), 11.6 (TAX MATTERS
FOR UBIQUITEL PARENT AND MEMBERS) and 11.7 (TAX MATTERS IN EVANS MERGER) shall

representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.10 (ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS)
shall survive for twenty-four (24) months following the CLOSING DATE, and (iii)
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.1(a) (ORGANIZATION

PARTIES INDEMNIFICATION) herein) based on a Breach of a representation or
warranty that is not commenced during the Survival Period of such representation
or warranty shall be deemed waived, and no Person shall have any remedy against
any Party for any such Breaches.

         12.2     INDEMNITIES.

                  (a)      INDEMNIFICATION OF UBIQUITEL.

                           (i)      LLC PARTIES INDEMNIFICATION.

         Subject to the other provisions of this Article 12, the Stockholders
and the Selling Member (excluding Evans if it has merged with Merger Sub V but
including the Controlling Evans Stockholders in such case), jointly and
severally (collectively, as applicable, the "LLC INDEMNITORS"), shall defend,
indemnify and hold UbiquiTel Parent and its Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, employees, stockholders or members (as the case may be),
agents, advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants and Affiliates
(collectively, the "UBIQUITEL INDEMNITEES"), harmless from and against, and
promptly reimburse the UbiquiTel Indemnitees for, any loss, expense, damage,
deficiency, liability, claim or obligation, including investigative costs, costs
of defense, settlement costs (subject to approval as provided below) and
attorneys' and accountants' fees (individually, a "LOSS" and collectively,
"LOSSES") that any UbiquiTel Indemnitee suffers or incurs or to which any
UbiquiTel Indemnitee becomes subject, which Losses arise out of or in connection
with (a) any Breach by LLC, and (b) any claim asserted by any third party that,
assuming the truth thereof, would constitute a Breach by LLC. If any LLC
Indemnitor (a "PAYING LLC INDEMNITOR") is required to pay or is held liable for
any amount with respect to an LLC indemnified claim, each of the other LLC
Indemnitors (the "REMAINING LLC INDEMNITORS") shall be liable to the Paying LLC
Indemnitor for, and shall contribute to and hold the Paying LLC Indemnitor
harmless from and against, an amount equal to such LLC Indemnitor's
proportionate share of such liability (based upon the aggregate dollar value of
the consideration received by such LLC Indemnitor pursuant to this Agreement) as
adjusted to account for a default by any LLC Indemnitor in meeting its
obligations hereunder. Any such amounts shall be paid within five days of the
date any Paying LLC Indemnitor is held liable for, or is required to pay, an LLC
Indemnified Claim.

                           (ii)     STOCKHOLDER GROUPS' INDEMNIFICATION.

         Subject to the other provisions of this Article 12, the members of each
Stockholder Group (collectively, as applicable, the "STOCKHOLDER GROUP
INDEMNITORS"), jointly and severally among the members of such Stockholder
Group, and severally and not jointly among separate Stockholder Groups, shall
defend, indemnify and hold the UbiquiTel Indemnitees harmless from and against,
and promptly reimburse the UbiquiTel Indemnitees for, any Losses that any
UbiquiTel Indemnitee suffers or incurs or to which any UbiquiTel Indemnitee
becomes subject, which Losses arise out of or in connection with any Breach by
such Stockholder Group of Article 7 hereof or Section 11.6 (TAX MATTERS FOR
UBIQUITEL PARENT AND MEMBERS). Each Stockholder belonging to a Stockholder Group
Indemnitor agrees that any liability for indemnification (a "STOCKHOLDER GROUP
INDEMNIFIED CLAIM") under this Section 12.2(a)(ii) shall be borne by each
Stockholder belonging to such Stockholder Group Indemnitor jointly and
severally, regardless of which Stockholder of such Stockholder Group Indemnitor
is required to make any payments to a UbiquiTel Indemnitee for such Stockholder
Group Indemnified Claim pursuant to this Section 12.2(a)(ii). If any Stockholder
of a Stockholder Group Indemnitor (a "PAYING STOCKHOLDER GROUP INDEMNITOR") is
required to pay or is held liable for any amount with respect to a Stockholder
Group Indemnified Claim, each of the other Stockholders of such Stockholder
Group Indemnitor (the "REMAINING STOCKHOLDER GROUP INDEMNITORS") shall be liable
to the Paying Stockholder Group Indemnitor for, and shall contribute to and hold
the Paying Stockholder Group Indemnitor harmless from and against, an amount
equal to such Stockholder's proportionate share of such liability based upon
number of shares of UbiquiTel Stock received by such Stockholder pursuant to
this Agreement, as adjusted to account for a default by any Stockholder in
meeting its obligations hereunder. Any such amounts shall be paid within five
days of the date any Paying Stockholder Group Indemnitor is held liable for, or
is required to pay, a Stockholder Group Indemnified Claim.

<PAGE>

                           (iii)    EVANS GROUP'S INDEMNIFICATION.

         The UbiquiTel Indemnitees shall be indemnified pursuant to the
Controlling Evans Stockholders Indemnification Agreement and not pursuant to
this Article 12 for any Losses that arise out of or in connection with the Evans
Telco Businesses, including but not limited to, any Losses that results from a
breach of Section 11.7 (TAX MATTERS IN EVANS MERGER) to the extent that such
Losses relate to the Evans Telco Businesses.

                  (b)      UBIQUITEL PARENT'S INDEMNIFICATION.

         Subject to the other provisions of this Article 12, UbiquiTel Parent
and its Affiliates, jointly and severally (collectively, the "UBIQUITEL
INDEMNITORS"), shall defend, indemnify and hold the LLC Parties, the Evans
Stockholders and their Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders and members (as the case may be), agents, advisors,
attorneys, accountants, consultants and Affiliates (collectively, the "LLC
PARTIES INDEMNITEES"), harmless from and against, and promptly reimburse the LLC
Indemnitees for, any Losses that any of the LLC Parties suffers or incurs or to
which any of the LLC Parties become subject, which Losses arise out of or in
connection with (a) any Breach by any of UbiquiTel Parent, UbiquiTel or the
Merger Subs of this Agreement, and (b) any claim asserted by any third party
that, assuming the truth thereof, would constitute a Breach by any of UbiquiTel
Parent, UbiquiTel or the Merger Subs.

         12.3     LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNITIES.

                  (a)      BASKET.

         After the Pre-CLOSING, none of the LLC Indemnitors or the Stockholder
Group Indemnitors shall have any obligation to indemnify the UbiquiTel
Indemnitees for Losses arising from a Breach of this Agreement until the
indemnifiable Losses incurred by the UbiquiTel Indemnitees, arising from a
Breach of this Agreement at or prior to the PRE-CLOSING (with respect to the LLC
Indemnitors) or the Closing (with respect to the Stockholder Group Indemnitors),
exceed $2,225,000 in the aggregate (the "BASKET"), at which time the LLC
Indemnitors and the Stockholder Group Indemnitors shall indemnify the UbiquiTel
Indemnitees only for amounts of the Losses in excess of the Basket, subject to
the Maximum Indemnification Amount set forth in Section 12.3(b) (ESCROW AND
MAXIMUM INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNT) below.

                  (b)      ESCROW AND MAXIMUM INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNT.

         No Stockholder, Selling Member or Controlling Evans Stockholder shall
incur any liability for Losses pursuant to this Article 12 in excess of its
Maximum Indemnification Amount. For purposes of this Agreement, a Stockholder's,
Selling Member's or Controlling Evans Stockholder's "MAXIMUM INDEMNIFICATION
AMOUNT" is its proportionate share of $30,000,000. Losses for Breach of this
Agreement may be assessed against shares of UbiquiTel Stock in the Escrow
Account or against one or more Stockholders, Controlling Evans Stockholders, or
the Selling Member; PROVIDED that a Stockholder, the Selling Member or a
Controlling Evans Stockholder may at its option discharge any indemnification
obligation with cash rather than with UbiquiTel Stock. Any shares of UbiquiTel
Stock delivered to UbiquiTel from the Escrow Account to satisfy claims for
Losses shall be valued at the Twenty Day Average CLOSING Price. For purposes of
this Agreement, "TWENTY DAY AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE" means the average of the
CLOSING sale price per share of UbiquiTel Stock as reported on The Nasdaq Stock
Market during the twenty consecutive trading-day period ending on the fifth
trading day prior to the Signing Date.

                                    -62-

<PAGE>

                  (c)      NO LIMITATIONS ON TAX INDEMNIFICATIONS.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the limitations
set forth in Sections 12(a) and 12(b) do not apply with respect to any Breach of
the representations, warranties, and covenants set forth in Sections 6.5(b),
7.5(b), 11.6, and 11.7.

                  (d)      DAMAGES.

         Losses recoverable for Breach of this Agreement shall be limited to
actual damages, and no Party shall recover consequential, punitive, lost
opportunity or special damages of any nature, regardless of the nature of such
Party's claim or such Party's theory of liability. In determining such Losses,
the Parties shall make appropriate adjustments for Tax benefits and insurance
coverage and take into account the time cost of money (using the short term
Applicable Federal Rate as the discount rate). All indemnification payments made
under this Article 12 by an indemnifying party shall be deemed adjustments to
the Merger Consideration, if any, received by such indemnifying party.

                  (e)      EXCLUSIVITY.

         In the absence of fraud, the indemnification provisions of this Article
12 shall be the exclusive remedy for any Losses, expense, damage, deficiency,
liability, claim or obligation, including investigative costs, costs of defense,
settlement costs (subject to consent as provided in Section 12.4(b) (DEFENSE
COSTS) below) and attorneys' and accountants' fees in connection with this
Agreement or any Related Agreement or any Breach hereof or thereof.

         12.4     NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND.

                  (a)      CLAIM NOTICES, ETC.

         If any Party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") receives notice of any
third-party claim or commencement of any third-party action or proceeding (an
"ASSERTED LIABILITY") with respect to which any other Party (an "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") is obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this Article 12, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give all Indemnifying Parties notice thereof.
The Indemnified Party's failure so to notify an Indemnifying Party shall not
cause the Indemnified Party to lose its right to indemnification under this
Article 12, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against an Asserted Liability that such
Indemnifying Party has the right to defend against hereunder (and except as
otherwise set forth in this Article 12). Such notice shall describe the Asserted
Liability in reasonable detail, and if practicable shall indicate the amount
(which may be estimated) of the Losses that have been or may be asserted by the
Indemnified Party. Each of the Indemnifying Parties may defend against an
Asserted Liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party utilizing counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, unless (i) the Indemnified Party
reasonably objects to the assumption of such defense on the grounds that counsel
for such Indemnifying Party cannot represent both the Indemnified Party and such
Indemnifying Party because such representation would be reasonably likely to
result in a conflict of interest or because there may be defenses available to
the Indemnified Party that are not available to such Indemnifying Party, (ii)
such Indemnifying Party is not capable (by reason of insufficient financial
capacity, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, managerial deadlock, managerial
neglect or similar events) of maintaining a reasonable defense of such action or
proceeding, or (iii) the action or proceeding seeks injunctive or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying
Party elects to conduct the defense, it is entitled to have exclusive control
over the defense and settlement thereof and the Indemnified Party will cooperate
and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as it
may reasonably request, at the Indemnifying Party's expense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control,

                                     -63-

<PAGE>

but may participate in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have
sole control over, the defense or settlement of any claim that (i) seeks a
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or specific
performance against the Indemnified Party, or (ii) would impose liability on
the part of the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

                  (b)      DEFENSE COSTS.

         If any Indemnifying Party defends an Asserted Liability in accordance
with Section 12.4(a) (CLAIM NOTICES, ETC.), it shall do so at its own expense
and shall not be responsible for the costs of defense, investigative costs,
attorneys' fees or other expenses incurred to defend the Asserted Liability
(collectively, "DEFENSE COSTS") of the Indemnified Party (which may continue to
defend, at its own expense). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Person
asserting the Asserted Liability against the Indemnified Party claims or seeks
amounts in excess of the amount set forth in Section 12.3(b) (ESCROW AND MAXIMUM
INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNT), then the Indemnifying Party shall remain liable for the
Defense Costs incurred by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party
assumes the defense of an Asserted Liability by reason of clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii) of subsection 12.4(a) (CLAIM NOTICES, ETC.) above, or because the
Indemnifying Party has not elected to assume the defense, then such Indemnifying
Party shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for its Defense Costs; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable for the costs of more than
one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any one jurisdiction.

                  (c)      THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

         The Parties shall cooperate with each other with respect to the defense
of any claims or litigation made or commenced by third parties subsequent to the
applicable CLOSING DATE with respect to which indemnification is not available
(for any reason) under this Article 12, PROVIDED that the Party requesting
cooperation shall reimburse the other Party for the other Party's reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of furnishing such cooperation.

         12.5     DELAYS OR OMISSIONS, ETC.

         Except as provided in Section 12.1 (SURVIVAL; ETC.) and Section 12.4
(NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND), no delay or omission to exercise any right,
power or remedy inuring to any Party upon any breach or default of any Party
under this Agreement or any Related Agreement shall impair any such right, power
or remedy of such Party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such
breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or
default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or
default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or
thereafter occurring.

         12.6     GOVERNING LAW.

         This Agreement and the Related Agreements shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted and applied in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of Delaware. Subject to Section 12.7 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION), each Party
hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of California, Fresno Division
and, if such court does not have jurisdiction, of the courts of the State of
California in Fresno County, for the purposes of any action arising out of this
Agreement or any of the Related Agreements, or the subject matter hereof or
thereof, brought by any other Party. Subject to Section 12.7 (DISPUTE
RESOLUTION), to the extent permitted by applicable law, each Party hereby waives
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise in any
such action, any claim (i) that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the
above-named courts, (ii) that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(iii) that it is immune from any legal process with respect to itself or its
property, (iv) that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is

                                     -64-

<PAGE>

improper or (v) that this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

         12.7     DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

                  (a)      ARBITRATION.

                           (i)      Any controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements, or the breach
thereof, shall be settled by arbitration before three arbitrators in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
(the "AAA") as in force on the date hereof, and judgment upon the award rendered
by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
initiating Party shall designate an arbitrator when it gives written notice of
arbitration to the other Party (the "RESPONDENT").

                           (ii)     The Respondent shall designate its
arbitrator when it files its answering statement, and if it fails to do so, then
the second arbitrator shall be named by the AAA. The two arbitrators so selected
shall name a third arbitrator within 30 days, or if they fail to do so, then the
third arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA. If any arbitrator appointed
hereunder shall die, resign, refuse, or become unable to act before an
arbitration decision is rendered, then the vacancy shall be filled by the
methods set forth in this Section 12.7(a) for the original appointment of such
arbitrator. All three arbitrators (and any successors) shall be impartial, and
no arbitrator shall have any bias or any personal or financial interest in the
arbitration or any past or present personal or financial relationship with the
Parties.

                           (iii)    Each Party shall bear its own arbitration
costs and expenses; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the arbitrators shall have
discretion in awarding attorneys' fees and other costs, in addition to any other
relief to which a Party to the arbitration may be entitled. The arbitration
hearing shall be held in Fresno, California at a location designated by a
majority of the arbitrators. The arbitration shall be governed by the
substantive laws of the State of Delaware.

                           (iv)     Except as set forth in Section 12.7(b)
(EMERGENCY RELIEF) below, the Parties stipulate that the provisions of this
Section 12.7 shall be a complete defense to any suit, action or proceeding
instituted in any federal, state or local court or before any administrative
tribunal with respect to any controversy or dispute arising out of this
Agreement or any of the Related Agreements. Neither Party hereto nor the
arbitrators may disclose the existence or results of any arbitration hereunder
without the prior written consent of the other Party; nor will any Party hereto
disclose to any third party any confidential information disclosed by any other
Party hereto in the course of an arbitration hereunder without the prior written
consent of such other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties
acknowledge that UbiquiTel Parent may disclose the existence or results of an
arbitration hereunder, as well as information otherwise required to be disclosed
by deposition, subpoena or other court or governmental action in connection with
UbiquiTel Parent's obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and in connection with UbiquiTel Parent's
registration of offerings of securities under the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, other laws, regulations or stock
exchange requirements.

                  (b)      EMERGENCY RELIEF.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.7 to the contrary and
subject to the provisions of Section 12.6 (GOVERNING LAW), any Party hereto may
seek from a court any provisional remedy that may be necessary to protect any
rights or property of such Party pending the establishment of the arbitral
tribunal or its determination of the merits of the controversy.

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of

the same instrument.

         13.9     TITLES AND SUBTITLES.

         The titles of the paragraphs and subparagraphs hereof are for

         13.10    EXPENSES.

         The Stockholders (and, if the Evans Merger occurs, the Evans
Stockholders) will bear all of the expenses (third-party or otherwise) incurred

execution and performance of this Agreement, the Related Agreements and the
transactions contemplated herein or therein, including without limitation all
fees and expenses of agents, representatives, counsel and accountants.

Committee. UbiquiTel will bear all of its expenses and the expenses of UbiquiTel
Parent and the Merger Subs.

         13.11    RESPONSIBILITY FOR MERGER SUB OBLIGATIONS.

         UbiquiTel Parent shall be directly responsible for assuring that the
Merger Subs perform all of their obligations hereunder.

         13.12    CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each of UbiquiTel Parent, UbiquiTel and the Merger Subs, on the one
hand, and the LLC Parties, on the other hand, acknowledge and agree that the
other Party is and will be relying upon the agreements made by them in this
Section 13.12 in entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                  (a)      POST-SIGNING CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Between the date of this Agreement and the CLOSING, all of the Parties
to this Agreement will maintain in confidence, and will cause their
Representatives to maintain in confidence, any written, oral, or other
information obtained in confidence from any other Party in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, unless (i) such information
is already known to such Person or to others not bound by a duty of
confidentiality or such information becomes publicly available through no fault
of such Person, (ii) the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in
making any filing or obtaining any consent required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) the furnishing or use of such
information is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection with any
applicable proceedings. If the transactions contemplated hereby are not
consummated, each Party hereto will destroy as much of any written information
obtained in confidence from any other Party in connection with this Agreement or
the contemplated transactions or return such information to such Party as the
other Party may request.

                  (b)      POST-CLOSING CONFIDENTIALITY.

         From the CLOSING and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, the LLC
Parties (for the purposes of this Section 13.12(b) the LLC Parties shall not
include LLC or the Members (including Evans, if the Evans Merger occurs)) shall
not, except as may be required by law or court order, at any time reveal,
divulge, communicate or make known to any Person (other than UbiquiTel Parent,
UbiquiTel and their respective agents) any information of UbiquiTel Parent or
UbiquiTel of a confidential and proprietary nature obtained in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and any technical information, product
information, customer information, marketing plans, proposals or information,
financial information, or any data, written material, records or documents used
by or relating to the business of LLC that are of a confidential nature (the
"UBIQUITEL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"). In the event that any of the LLC Parties
believes that it is required to disclose any such UbiquiTel Confidential
Information pursuant to any applicable law or court order, such LLC Party shall
give timely written notice to UbiquiTel Parent so that UbiquiTel Parent may have
an opportunity to obtain a protective order or other appropriate relief.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the LLC Parties'
obligations and UbiquiTel Parent 's rights under this Section 13.12(b) shall
remain in effect after, and shall survive, the CLOSING of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the LLC Parties specifically
acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section 13.12(b) are
reasonable and necessary to protect the interests of UbiquiTel Parent and
UbiquiTel, that any violation of this Section 13.12(b) will result in an
irreparable injury to UbiquiTel Parent and UbiquiTel and that the remedy at law
for any breach of this Section 13.12(b) will be inadequate. In the event of any
breach or threatened breach by any of the LLC Parties of any provision of this
Section 13.12(b), UbiquiTel Parent, in addition to any other relief available to
it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief,


                                      -74-
<PAGE>

restraining such Party from using or disclosing any UbiquiTel Confidential
Information in whole or in part, or from engaging in conduct that otherwise
would constitute a breach of the obligations of such Party under this Section
13.12(b), without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond or
other security. Such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any
other remedies that may be available, including an action for the recovery of
damages.
