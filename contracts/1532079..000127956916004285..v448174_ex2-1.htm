such Acquisition Proposal and  its Representatives, and may provide copies
of, access to or disclosure of information,  properties, facilities, books or
records of the Corporation or its subsidiaries for a  maximum of 10 calendar

person making the Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives, provided that: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (A)| the  Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and
its outside legal counsel,  determines in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably  be expected to constitute or lead
to a Superior Proposal;

   | (B)| such  person was not prohibited from making such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to an existing  confidentiality, standstill, non-
disclosure, use, business purpose or similar restriction  with the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;

   | (C)| the  Corporation has been, and continues to be, in compliance
with its obligations under this  Article 6; and

that restricts such person from acquiring, or publicly  announcing an
intention to acquire, any securities or assets of the Corporation (other 
than pursuant to a Superior Proposal) for a period of not less than 12 months
from the  date of such Agreement (unless such person is already a party to a
confidentiality or  standstill agreement with the Corporation) provided that
such confidentiality and standstill  agreement may not include any provision
calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with  the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries and may not restrict the Corporation from  complying with
this Agreement (including this Article 6) and provided the Corporation  sends
a copy of any such confidentiality and standstill agreement to the Acquiror
promptly  upon its execution and thereafter the Acquiror is provided with
access to any information  that was provided to such person and not
previously provided to the Acquiror prior to  or concurrently with such
information being provided to such person.

   | (b)| If the  Corporation receives an Acquisition Proposal prior to
the approval of the Arrangement  Resolution by the Securityholders that the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation  with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the  Board may
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if 
and only if: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| the  person making the Superior Proposal was not prohibited from
making such Superior Proposal  pursuant to an existing confidentiality,
standstill, non-disclosure, use, business purpose  or similar restriction
with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| the  Corporation has been, and continues to be, in compliance
with its obligations under this  Article 6; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| the  Corporation has delivered written notice to the Acquiror
of the determination of the  Board that the Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal and of the intention of the  Board to approve or recommend
such Superior Proposal and/or of the Corporation to enter  into an agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, together with a copy of such 
agreement (including any financing documents supplied to the Corporation in
connection  therewith unless precluded to do so by confidentiality provisions
contained therein)  (the "Superior Proposal Notice"); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| at  least five (5) Business Days have elapsed since the date
the Superior Proposal Notice was  received by the Acquiror and the date on

Period"; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| during  any Match Period, the Acquiror has had the opportunity

amend this Agreement and the Arrangement in order  for such Acquisition
Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| after  the Match Period, the Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its  outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal continues  to constitute a Superior
Proposal (if applicable, compared to the terms of the Arrangement  as
proposed to be amended by the Acquiror under Section 6.3(c)); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vii)| the  Corporation terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.2(e) and the Corporation  has previously paid or, concurrently with
termination, pays the Termination Payment to  the Acquiror.

by the Acquiror to amend the terms of the Arrangement and  this Agreement in
order to determine, in good faith, after consultation with its financial 
advisors and outside counsel, whether the Acquiror's offer to amend the
Arrangement  and this Agreement, upon its acceptance, would result in the
Acquisition Proposal ceasing  to be a Superior Proposal compared to the
amendment to the terms of the Arrangement and  this Agreement offered by the
Acquiror, and (iii) the Corporation shall negotiate  in good faith with the
Acquiror to make such amendments to the terms of this Agreement  and the
Arrangement as would enable the Acquiror to proceed with the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement on such amended terms. If the Board
determines that the Acquisition  Proposal would cease to be a Superior
Proposal, the Corporation shall promptly so advise  the Acquiror and the
Corporation and the Acquiror shall enter into an amendment to this  Agreement
reflecting the offer by the Acquiror to amend the terms of the Arrangement 
and this Agreement, and shall take and cause to be taken all such actions as
are necessary  to give effect to the foregoing. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| At the  written request of the Acquiror, the Board shall
promptly reaffirm the Board Recommendation  by press release after: (i) any
Acquisition Proposal (which is determined not to  be a Superior Proposal) is
publicly announced, made or disclosed; or (ii) the Board  determines that a
proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement and this Agreement  would
result in a previously announced Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior
Proposal.  The Acquiror and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment  on the form and content of any such press
release, and the Corporation shall reasonably  consider any such comments,
recognizing that whether or not such comments are appropriate  will be
determined by the Corporation.

complying with Section 2.17 of National  Instrument 62-104 - _Take-Over Bids
and Issuer Bids_ and similar provisions  under Securities Laws relating to
the provision of a directors' circular in respect  of an Acquisition Proposal
for the Corporation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding  that the Board
shall be permitted to make such disclosure, the Board shall not be permitted 
to make a change to the Board Recommendation, other than as permitted by
Section 6.3(a).  The Acquiror and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment  on the form and content of any such
disclosure relating to this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated
hereby. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| If the  Corporation provides the Acquiror with a Superior
Proposal Notice on a date that is less  than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Meeting, at the request of the Acquiror, the Corporation  will either
proceed with or adjourn the Meeting to a date that is not less than three 
(3) Business Days and not more than 10 Business Days after the date the
Superior Proposal  Notice is provided to the Acquiror, as such date is
requested by the Acquiror. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | \- 36 -| 
---|---|---

a new five (5) Business Day Match Period from the later of the date on which 
the Acquiror received the Superior Proposal Notice and the date on which the
Acquiror  received all of the materials set forth in Section 6.3(b)(iii) with

Any termination pursuant to (b) - (f) shall be effected by written notice
from the terminating party to the other party.

  



   | 10.3| Termination and Payment 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The Acquiror, in consideration  for the disposition of its
rights under this Agreement, shall be entitled to a cash termination  payment
in the amount of $24,000,000 (the "Termination Payment"),  upon the
occurrence of any of the following events (each a "Termination Payment 
Event") which shall be paid by the Corporation within the time specified in 
respect of each such Termination Payment Event: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| this Agreement is terminated by the  Acquiror pursuant to
Section 10.2(d)(i) (other than where the reason for adjourning or  postponing
the Meeting is only as a result of the occurrence of a postal disruption)  or
Section 10.2(d)(ii), in which case the Termination Payment shall be paid to
the Acquiror  no later than 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) on the next
Business Day following  the date the Agreement is terminated; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | \- 52 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (ii)| this Agreement is terminated by  the Corporation pursuant to
Section 10.2(e) in which case the Termination Payment  shall be paid to the
Acquiror in accordance with Section 6.3(b)(vii); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| this Agreement is terminated by  the Acquiror pursuant to
Section 10.2(b)(i) but only if: (A) prior to the time  of the holding of the
Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or otherwise  publicly
disclosed, and not publicly withdrawn prior to the date of the Meeting, by
any  person (other than the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates) or any person
(other than the  Acquiror or any of its Affiliates) shall have publicly
announced or otherwise publicly  disclosed an intention to make an
Acquisition Proposal; and (B) within 12 months  following the date of such
termination (1) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated  or effected, or (2)
the Corporation and/or one or more of its subsidiaries enters  into a
definitive agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal and such
Acquisition  Proposal is consummated or effected, whether or not within such
12 month period, in which  case the Termination Payment shall be payable
concurrently with the consummation or effectiveness  of such Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of this clause (iii), the term "Acquisition  Proposal"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 1.1, except  that
references to "20%" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or  more". 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The Termination Payment shall be  paid by the Corporation to the
Acquiror by wire transfer in immediately available funds  to an account
specified by the Acquiror, provided that in no event will the Corporation  be
required to pay more than one Termination Payment. For greater certainty, the
obligations  of the Corporation under this Section 10.3 shall survive the
termination of this  Agreement, regardless of the circumstances thereof. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Except as set out in Section 10.4(b)  with respect to wilful
breach, the Corporation acknowledges that the amount set out in  this Section
10.3 in respect of the Termination Payment represents liquidated damages 
which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages, including opportunity costs,
which the  Acquiror will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise
to such damages and  resultant termination of this Agreement, and is not a
penalty. The Corporation irrevocably  waives any right it may have to raise
as a defence that any such liquidated damages are  excessive or punitive. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10.4| Effect of Termination 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, this
Agreement shall be of no further force and effect without liability of any
party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such party) to any other party to this Agreement, except
that:

  



  

   

 | \- 53 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (a)| in the event of termination under  Section 10.1 as a result of
the Effective Time occurring, Section 8.7 shall  survive for a period of six
(6) years following such termination; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| in the event of termination under  Section 10.2, this Section
10.4 and Article 11 shall survive the termination  of this Agreement, and
provided further that no party shall be relieved of any liability  for any
wilful breach by it of this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| nothing contained in this Agreement  shall relieve or have the
effect of relieving any party in any way from liability for  damages incurred
or suffered by a party if the Agreement is terminated in any circumstances 
other than pursuant to a Termination Payment Event; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| upon any termination of this Agreement  under circumstances
where the Acquiror is entitled to a Termination Payment and such  Termination
Payment is paid in full, the Acquiror and the Parent shall be precluded from 
any other remedy against the Corporation at Law or in equity or otherwise
(including,  without limitation, an order for specific performance), and
shall not seek to obtain  any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or  punitive damages, against the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or any of their  respective directors,
officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders  or Affiliates
or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement or  the
transactions contemplated hereby, provided that the foregoing limitation shall
not  apply in the event of wilful breach by the Corporation of this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10.5| Remedies 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to Section 10.4, the parties acknowledge and agree that an award of
money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any
party or its Representatives and any such breach would cause the non-
breaching party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties agree that, in the
event of any breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the non-breaching
party will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or
other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific
performance. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach
of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at
law or equity to each of the parties.

---|---|---

and withhold from any amount payable to any Optionholder or Securityholders
(including any payments to Dissenting Securityholders), such amounts as the
Corporation, the Acquiror, or the Depositary may be entitled or required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the _Tax Act_ or any
provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as
amended or succeeded, and to remit such deducted and withheld amounts to
the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly
deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes as having been paid to the Optionholder or Securityholder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such
deducted and withheld amounts are actually remitted in accordance with
applicable law to the appropriate taxing authority.
