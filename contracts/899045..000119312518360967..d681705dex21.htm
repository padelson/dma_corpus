ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF ACQUIRED SECURITIES

1.1 _Purchase and Sale of_ _Acquired Securities_. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers
will sell, assign, transfer and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
purchase and acquire from the Sellers, all of the Acquired Securities owned by
such Seller free and clear of any Liens (other than limitations under the
Organizational Documents of the issuer of such Acquired Securities or
limitations under any federal, state or foreign securities Laws) in exchange
for the payment of the Purchase Price in cash to the Sellers.

1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the purchase of the
Acquired Securities shall be an amount equal to (a) $418,500,000 (the " _Base
Price_ "), _plus_ (b) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital exceeds
the Working Capital Target, _minus_ (c) the amount, if any, by which
the Working Capital Target exceeds the Working Capital, _plus_ (d) the
Closing Cash, _minus_ (e) Closing Date Indebtedness, _minus_ (f) Transaction
Expenses (such resulting amount pursuant to _Sections 1.2(a)-(f)_ , and as
such amount may be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
1.4_, the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 

1.3 _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be
paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more bank
accounts designated in writing by the Representative at least one Business Day
prior to the Closing Date, the following amounts (each such payment, a "
_Closing Payment_ "):

 

(a) payment to each Seller of such SellerÂ’s portion of the Closing
Consideration as set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement, which payments are
hereby directed to be paid to Fairway 2.0 on behalf of each Seller (for
distribution to the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages);

 

(b) payment to the Escrow Agent of a cash amount equal to the Escrow Amount
for the Escrow Fund;

 



2

    

(c) payment to the Representative of a cash amount equal to the
Representative Expense Fund;

(d) payment on behalf of the Fairway Group Companies, to the payees
thereof, of a cash amount equal to the amount of all Closing Date Payoff
Indebtedness (excluding the Securitization Indebtedness) and all Transaction
Expenses; and

 

(e) payment on behalf of the Fairway Group Companies, to Deutsche Bank
Trust Company Americas, as indenture trustee under the Indenture (" _Trustee_
"), of a cash amount equal to the amount of all Securitization Indebtedness.

Each of the Closing Payments shall be made in the amounts and as set forth in
the Pre-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to _Section 1.4_.

 

1.4 _Adjustment of the Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Statement_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
delivered to Purchaser a statement (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_") setting
forth (i) the CompanyÂ’s good faith estimate of the Purchase Price (the "
_Estimated Purchase Price_ "), together with reasonably detailed calculations
demonstrating each component thereof, which has been prepared in a manner
consistent with the definitions of the terms Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and the Accounting Rules
and (ii) __ the amount of the Closing Consideration payable to each Seller.

 

(b) _Final Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted following the Closing based on the difference between the Final
Closing Date Purchase Price (as determined in accordance with this _Section
1.4_) and the Estimated Purchase Price, and payment shall be made in respect
of any such post-Closing adjustment as set forth in _Section 1.4(e)_.

(c) _Closing Statement_. No later than 90 days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause to be prepared in good faith and delivered to the
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Purchase Price (" _Closing Date Purchase
Price_ "), together with an unaudited, consolidated balance sheet of the
Blockers and the Fairway Group Companies as of the close of business on the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date and the derivation of the
Closing Date Purchase Price therefrom. The Closing Statement will be prepared
in a manner consistent with the definitions of the terms Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and the
Accounting Rules and shall take into account any reduction in Taxes of the
Blockers that were included in the Estimated Purchase Price attributable to
State Mitigation Measures in accordance with _Section 9.8_. The Closing
Statement will entirely disregard (i) __ any

 



3

    

 and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the Blockers and the Fairway
Group Companies as a result of any financing or refinancing arrangements
entered into at any time by Purchaser or its Affiliates or any other
transaction entered into by Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the
consummation of the Transaction, and (ii) any of the plans, transactions, or
changes which Purchaser intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated
or made after the Closing with respect to the Blockers or any Fairway Group
Company or their respective businesses or assets, or any facts or
circumstances that are unique or particular to Purchaser or its Affiliates or
any of their assets or liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, unless the
Representative otherwise agrees in writing, Purchaser may not amend, adjust,
supplement or modify the Closing Statement or the amount of Closing Date
Purchase Price following its delivery to the Representative. After the
Closing Date, at PurchaserÂ’s request, the Representative shall reasonably
assist Purchaser in the preparation of the Closing Statement and shall provide
Purchaser with any reasonably requested information in connection therewith
(in each case to the extent reasonably relevant to the preparation of the
Closing Statement). If Purchaser fails to deliver the Closing Statement within
such 90-day period, then in addition to any other rights the Representative
and Sellers may have under this Agreement, the Representative shall have the
right to elect that the Estimated Purchase Price be deemed to be the amount of
the Closing Date Purchase Price and be final and binding and used for
purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_. The
Parties acknowledge that no adjustments may be made to the Working Capital
Target.

 

(d) _Disputes_.

 

(i) The Representative shall have 60 days to review the Closing Statement.
If the Representative disagrees with PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Closing
Date Purchase Price as set forth in the Closing Statement, the Representative
may, within 60 days after receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a written
notice to Purchaser (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") disagreeing with such
calculation and setting forth the RepresentativeÂ’s alternative calculations
for each item of disagreement. Any matters not disputed by the Representative
in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed to have been accepted in all respects
by the Representative and final and binding upon the Parties. If the
Representative fails to deliver such notice during such 60-day period, the
Representative shall have waived its rights to contest the Closing Statement
and the calculations of the Closing Date Purchase Price set forth therein
shall be deemed to be final and binding upon the Parties and such amount shall
be used for purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant to  _Section
1.4(e)_.

(ii) If a Dispute Notice is duly delivered pursuant to  _Section
1.4(d)(i)_, the Representative and Purchaser shall, during the 30 days
following such delivery, attempt to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts to determine, as may be required, the amount of the Closing Date
Purchase Price. Any such agreement shall be in writing and shall be final and
binding upon the Parties. If during such period, the Representative and
Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, then all amounts and items
remaining in dispute shall be submitted by the Representative and Purchaser
to Duff __ and Phelps LLC (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") for a determination
resolving such disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the
Closing Date Purchase Price (it being agreed and understood that the
Accounting Referee shall act as an expert (and not an arbitrator) to determine
such

 



4

    

 disputed items or amounts (and, as a result thereof, the Closing Date
Purchase Price) and shall do so based solely on written presentations and
information provided by Purchaser and the Representative and not by
independent review). Purchaser and the Representative shall agree, promptly
after the appointment of the Accounting Referee, on the process and procedures
governing the resolution of any disputed items by the Accounting Referee,
_provided_ , that if such Parties fail to agree on such process and procedures
within 10 days following the appointment of the Accounting Referee, then such
process and procedures shall be determined by the Accounting Referee (it
being agreed and understood that such process shall include, at a minimum,
appropriate measures to ensure compliance by the applicable parties with
_Section 1.4(f)_ and the process and procedures for the submission of any
written presentations by the Representative and Purchaser and the time
periods thereof). In conducting its review, the Accounting Referee shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and PurchaserÂ’s
calculations of the Closing Date Purchase Price as to which the
Representative has disagreed. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Accounting Referee shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and
determining whether the items in dispute were determined in accordance
with this Agreement (including the definition of the terms Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and the
Accounting Rules) and the Accounting Referee is not to make any other
determination. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the Representative and
Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than 30 days
from the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth
its calculations of the Closing Date Purchase Price, which amount shall not
be less than the applicable amount thereof shown in PurchaserÂ’s calculation
delivered pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)_ nor more than the amount thereof shown
in the RepresentativeÂ’s calculation delivered pursuant to _Section
1.4(d)(i)_. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Parties and shall
be used for purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)_ above. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute
resolution mechanism contained in this _Section 1.4(d)_ shall be the
exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes regarding the Purchase Price
adjustment, if any. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Accounting Referee in any court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Parties in proportion
to the relative amount each PartyÂ’s determination has been modified, with any
amount to be borne by the Representative to be paid solely out of the Escrow
Fund. For example, if the Representative challenges the calculation of the
Closing Date Purchase Price by an amount of $100,000, but the Accounting
Referee determines that the Representative has a valid claim for only $60,000,
the Representative shall bear (solely out of the Escrow Fund) 40% of the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee and Purchaser shall bear the other 60%
of such fees and expenses.

(e) _Final Closing Date Purchase Price_. Following the time that the
Closing Date Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this _Section
1.4_ (such finally determined amount, the " _Final Closing Date Purchase
Price_ "), payment shall be made as follows:

 

(i) If the Final Closing Date Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Purchase Price, within five Business Days after the Final Closing Date
Purchase

 



5

    

 Price is determined pursuant to this _Section 1.4_, (x) Purchaser shall pay
to the Representative, for distribution to the Sellers in accordance with
their Pro Rata Percentages (subject to adjustments by the Representative
necessary to give effect to adjustments caused by changes in the calculation
of Closing Cash of the Blockers), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by the Representative, an
amount equal to such excess and (y) __ the Representative and Purchaser shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the Representative, for
distribution to the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages
(subject to adjustments by the Representative necessary to give effect to
adjustments caused by changes in the calculation of Closing Cash of the
Blockers), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated in writing by the Representative, the remaining funds in
the Escrow Fund.

(ii) If the Final Closing Date Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price, within five Business Days after the Final Closing Date
Purchase Price is determined pursuant to this _Section 1.4_, the
Representative and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (x)
__ pay to Purchaser, out of the Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser, an amount
equal to such deficiency and (y), __ if and to the extent that any balance
in the Escrow Fund will remain after such payment to Purchaser, release to the
Representative, for distribution to the Sellers in accordance with their Pro
Rata Percentages (subject to adjustments by the Representative necessary to
give effect to adjustments caused by changes in the calculation of Closing
Cash of the Blockers), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one
or more accounts designated in writing by the Representative, the remaining
funds in the Escrow Fund.

Upon payment of the amounts provided in this _Section 1.4(e)_ in accordance
herewith, none of the Parties may make or assert any claim under this
_Section 1.4_.

(f) _Cooperation_. During the period of time from and after the Closing
Date through the final determination and payment of the Final Closing Date
Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section 1.4_, the Representative and
Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Fairway Group Companies, the
Blockers and each of its and their representatives to, reasonably cooperate
and assist in any review by the Accounting Referee of the Closing Statement
and the calculations of the Closing Date Purchase Price and in the conduct of
the review referred to in this _Section 1.4_. Purchaser shall afford, and
shall cause the Fairway Group Companies and the Blockers to afford, to the
Representative and any accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by

5.16 _Employee Benefits Plans_.

 

(a) _Section_ __ _ 5.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete and correct list of the material Benefit Plans. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Benefit Plan" means each "employee benefit plan" (as that

sharing, deferred compensation, equity or equity-based, health and welfare,
severance pay, vacation, bonus, incentive, fringe benefit, retention,
employment or each change of control plan or agreement that is maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by any of the Fairway Group Companies for the

the Code has received a favorable determination, opinion, or approval letter
from the IRS. With respect to each Benefit Plan, all material contributions,
distributions, reimbursements and premium payments that are due have been
timely made. No Fairway Group Company is liable for any material tax or
penalty with respect to any Benefit Plan, including any liability imposed by
under ERISA Section __ 502, ERISA Section __ 4071, or Chapter 43 of the Code
and to the Knowledge of the Company no facts exist which would be reasonably
expected to trigger such material taxes or penalties.

 

(e) No Legal Proceeding (other than routine claims for benefits) has been
instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any
Benefit Plan. There have been no "prohibited transactions" within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 or __ 407 of ERISA and not
otherwise exempt under Section __ 408 of ERISA and no breaches of fiduciary
duty (as determined under ERISA) with respect to any Benefit Plan, in each
case that would result in material liability to any Fairway Group Company.

 

(f) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.16(f)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Fairway Group Company maintains or has any obligation
to provide any post-termination or post-retirement health or life insurance
benefits to any Person, except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code
and Section __ 601 of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") or any other applicable Law.

(g) Except as set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(g)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transaction (either alone or in combination with another
event) will not result in the payment of any amount under any arrangements in
effect on the date of this Agreement that would, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, not be deductible as a result of
Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(g)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Transaction alone, or in a combination
with any other event, will not accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer
or director of any of the Fairway Group Companies under any Benefit Plan.

 

(h) No asset of any of the Fairway Group Companies is subject to any
security interest or lien under the Code relating to the Benefit Plans or
under Title I or Title IV of ERISA, including ERISA Section 4068 or arising
out of any action filed under ERISA Section __ 4301(b).

 



31

    

(i) No Fairway Group Company has incurred any liability which could
subject any of its assets to liability under ERISA Section 4062, 4063, 4064 or
406.

 

(j) No Fairway Group Company has incurred or been assessed any withdrawal
liability within the meaning of ERISA Section 4201 or any contingent
withdrawal liability under ERISA Section __ 4204 to any multiemployer plans
as defined by ERISA Section __ 4001(3) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ").

 

(k) No event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur (including in
connection with this transaction) with respect to any Fairway Group Company
that could reasonably be expected to result in an assessment of withdrawal
liability within the meaning of ERISA Section 4201 or any contingent
withdrawal liability under ERISA Section __ 4204 to any Multiemployer Plan.

5.17 _Labor_. No Fairway Group Company is a party to any collective

Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule delivered by Purchaser to the

it is now being conducted. Purchaser is in good standing and duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the character or location of any properties or assets owned or
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Transaction has been duly authorized by the requisite corporate, limited
liability company, limited partnership or other similar action on the part of
Purchaser. Each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party has been
or will be at or prior to the Closing, duly and validly executed and delivered
by Purchaser and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
the other parties thereto) each of the Transaction Agreements, when so
executed and delivered, will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligations of Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable Equitable Principles.

 

6.3 _Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties_.

 

(a) Assuming the making of the filings and notifications and the receipt of
the consents or waiting period terminations or expirations identified in
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_, none of the execution and delivery by Purchaser of
this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, or
the consummation of the Transaction, conflicts with, violates or constitutes
a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or permit
the acceleration of any obligation under, or give rise to a right of
termination, modification cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
loss of any benefit under, or require any consent, approval or waiver from any
Person pursuant to any provision of (i) the Organizational Documents of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; (ii) __ any Contract or Permit to which

properties or assets of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates are bound; or (iii)
__ any Law applicable to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, except in the
case of clauses (ii) __ and (iii), where such conflict, violation or default
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect.

termination, Order, Permit or authorization of, or declaration, registration
or filing with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority is required on
the part of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, or the consummation of the

of which to make or obtain would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

6.4 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no pending or, to the knowledge
of Purchaser, threatened, Legal Proceedings against Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect. There is no outstanding material Order imposed upon
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective assets, except
for Legal Proceedings which, if adversely determined, would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

6.5 _Financial Capability_. Purchaser has (i) sufficient cash on hand
(without giving effect to any unfunded financing regardless of whether any
such financing is committed) to pay the Purchase Price and all related fees
and expenses in connection with the Transaction and (ii) the resources
and capabilities (financial or otherwise) to perform its obligations
hereunder and Purchaser has not incurred any obligation, commitment,
restriction or liability of any kind that would impair or adversely affect
such resources and capabilities.

own account and for investment purposes and not with a view to the
distribution thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that the Acquired Securities have
not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities law and

Securities until and unless the offer and sale of such Acquired Securities is
subsequently registered under the Securities Act and all applicable state
securities Laws or an exemption from such registration is applicable.

the Blockers and the Fairway Group Companies and their respective businesses,

including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due. The Transaction is not being made by Purchaser
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditors of
Purchaser, any Blocker or any of the Fairway Group Companies.

medical, dental and vision insurance and health flexible spending account plan
coverage until December 31, 2018 under the applicable Benefit Plans listed
on  _Section_ __ _ 7.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to
Purchaser promptly paying or reimbursing to Fairway 2.0 (i) the full premium
cost of the dental and vision insurance coverage pro-rated for the period of
time between the Closing and December 31, 2018, (ii) the amount of the actual
medical claims costs incurred by the Continuing Participants for claims
incurred during the period of time between the Closing and December 31, 2018,
(iii) the amount of the payroll deductions associated with funding the health
flexible spending account December 2018 contribution but only to the extent
(A) such amounts were deducted from Continuing ParticipantsÂ’ pay during the
period of time between the Closing and December 31, 2018 and (B) Purchaser
received such payroll

 



42

    

 deductions, and (iv) an administrative charge in the amount set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 7.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall
include only the actual charges by third party vendors and reinsurers pro-
rated for the period of time between the Closing and December 31, 2018.

such charges. Purchaser and the Fairway Group Companies shall be solely
responsible for complying with the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code
for all Continuing Participants who experience a qualifying event (as
determined under Section 4980B of the Code) at any time. Fairway 2.0 shall be
a third-party beneficiary of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
7.10_. Upon written request by Purchaser, the Representative shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Purchaser all reasonably available documents,
certificates, agreements, and amendments, duly executed that change the plan
sponsor under each Benefit Plan to Fairway 2.0 and allow Fairway Outdoor
Advertising, LLC employees to participate in the Benefit Plans between Closing
and December 31, 2018.

acquisition of the Acquired Shares shall not grant Purchaser any rights in
the name "GTCR", "GTCR/FMG", "NCP", "Newstone" or any abbreviations or
derivations thereof. Purchaser shall refrain from using such names or
abbreviations or derivations after the Closing (except in reference to
historical fact) and shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing,
change the legal name of each of Blockers to a name that is not confusingly
similar to such name and that does not use the name "GTCR", "GTCR/FMG",

Covenants_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations
or other agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising
out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing (and
there shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for
(a) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their
terms contemplate performance in whole or in part after the Closing and then
only with respect to any breaches occurring after the Closing, (b) _ARTICLE
IX_ , and (c) _ARTICLE X_ (but in the case of  _Section_ __ _ 10.9_, solely

ARTICLE IX

 

TAX MATTERS

 

9.1 _Tax Returns_. The Company shall, at its expense, use the historic Tax
Return preparers of the Fairway Group Companies to prepare any Pass-Through
Income Tax Returns of the Fairway Group Companies for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date and for all
Straddle Periods (" _Seller Tax Returns_ "). The Company shall deliver to
Purchaser and the Representative copies of any such Seller Tax Returns at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing any such Seller Tax
Return (taking into account all applicable extensions) for
the RepresentativeÂ’s and PurchaserÂ’s review and written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, all Seller Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Fairway Group Companies in filing
such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any gain recognized by the
Fairway Group Companies in respect of the Company Restructuring shall be
allocated to the Pre-Closing Period and further allocated to the Blockers and
the Selling Members, as applicable, (ii) to the maximum extent permitted by
Law, any Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as relating to the Pre-
Closing Period and (iii) a timely election shall be made to apply Rev. Proc.
2011-29 with respect to any amounts paid or payable in connection with the
Closing that constitute success-based fees within the scope of Rev. Proc.
2011-29. Purchaser and the Representative agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any dispute arising as with respect to any Seller Return and if they
cannot agree on any disputed issue or item, such disputed issues shall be
referred to, and resolved by (within a reasonable time, taking into account
the deadline for filing such Seller Return) the Accounting Referee or another
nationally recognized independent accounting firm to be mutually agreed upon
by Purchaser and the Representative (such agreed firm being the " _Tax
Referee_ "). Purchaser shall timely and properly file, or cause to be filed,
such Seller Return reflecting the dispute as finally and conclusively
resolved by the Tax Referee; _provided_ that if the disputed items are not
resolved before the filing due date (taking into account extensions), any such
Seller Return shall be finalized and filed in the manner provided by the
Representative, and, to the extent the disputed items are resolved by the Tax
Referee in the manner proposed by Purchaser, Purchaser will promptly amend or
cause to be amended such Seller Return consistent with such resolution to the
extent permitted by Law. The costs, fees and expenses of the Tax Referee shall
be borne equally by the Representative and Purchaser. The Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to (A) complete all final Pass-Through Income Tax
Returns (including Schedules K-1) of the Company for Tax periods that include
the Closing Date by February 28, 2019 and (B) provide the Representative with
any information or estimates reasonably required by it or its Affiliates for
tax reporting purposes promptly upon request by the Representative.

 

9.2 _Audits_. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Representative in writing upon receiving notice from any Taxing Authority of
the commencement of any audit or administrative or judicial proceedings
relating to Pass-Through Income Tax Returns of any Fairway Group Company for
any Pre-Closing Period and any Straddle Period (" _Tax Contest_ "). The
Representative and Purchaser shall jointly control the conduct and resolution
of any such Tax Contest, _provided_ that any such Tax Contest shall not be
settled without the prior written consent of both Purchaser and the
Representative, neither of which shall be unreasonably withheld,

 



44

    

 conditioned or delayed. If the Representative elects not to participate in
the conduct and resolution of any Tax Contest, the Representative shall notify
Purchaser in writing and Purchaser shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest; _provided_ that Purchaser (a)
shall keep the Representative informed of the progress of such Tax Contest,
(b) shall promptly provide the Representative with copies of all material
documents (including material notices, protests, briefs, written rulings and
determinations and correspondence) pertaining to such Tax Contest and (c)
shall not settle such Tax Contest without the RepresentativeÂ’s consent, not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to cooperate in good faith with
the Representative in connection with any Tax Contest to avoid the need to
make adjustments to or otherwise amend filed Tax Returns of any member of the
Company, including by having the applicable Fairway Group Company pay directly
to the applicable Governmental Authority any income Taxes for a Pre-Closing
Period resulting from the resolution of such Tax Contest rather than flowing
out corresponding adjustments to the Selling Members, as reasonably directed
by the Representative, in which case the Representative would reimburse
Purchaser for the Selling MembersÂ’ share of such income Taxes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that should the Representative fail to reimburse Purchaser for the
Selling MembersÂ’ share of such income Taxes prior to the due date for making
the election provided for in Code Section 6226 (or any comparable provision of
state or local income Tax Law), Purchaser shall be entitled in its sole
discretion to make the election provided for in Code Section 6226 (or any
comparable provision of state or local income Tax Law) in respect of any
applicable Tax Contest.

 

9.3 _Filing and Amendment of Tax Returns_. Without the prior written
consent of the Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed), Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to: (a)
except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, file or amend any Pass-Through
Income Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any
Straddle Period), or (b) rescind or change any Tax election or accounting
method that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Period (including any
Straddle Period) of any Fairway Group Company.

9.4 _Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, Purchaser and the
Representative shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (a)
assist the other Party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other Party is
responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
9.1_, and in connection therewith provide the other Party necessary powers of
attorney, (b) cooperate fully in preparing for and conducting any audits of,
or disputes with Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Fairway
Group Companies or Blockers, (c) cooperate fully in preparing any Tax Return
amendments and ruling requests and other submissions pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 9.8_ and (d) make available to the other Party as reasonably requested all
information, records, and documents relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Fairway Group Companies and the Blockers. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Purchaser and the Representative shall retain (and shall cause their
Affiliates to retain) copies of all Tax Returns and related workpapers for all
taxable periods that include the Closing Date and all prior taxable periods
until the expiration of the statute of limitations to which such Tax Returns
relate. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall
furnish to the Representative (i) as soon as reasonably practicable after the
end of the taxable year of the Company that includes the Closing Date, and in
any event within 60 days after such date, best available estimates of all
information concerning the Company reasonably required for the preparation of
income Tax Returns of the Selling Members in sufficient detail to enable each
such Selling Member to prepare its federal, state, local, foreign and other
income Tax Returns for periods that include the Pre-Closing Periods of the
Company (including Straddle Periods).

 



45

    

9.5 _Tax-Sharing  Agreements_. Prior to the Closing, the Fairway Group
Companies and the Blockers have terminated all Tax sharing or allocation
agreements to which any of them was a party (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Tax distribution agreements with respect to the Company (but not
including any Tax distribution or allocation provisions in the Organizational
Documents of the Company)) and have caused all amounts owing thereunder to be
settled.

 

9.6 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Sellers and Purchaser agree that an
election under Section 754 of the Code (and any analogous state or local
provision) (the " _Section_ __ _ 754 Election_") shall be made for the
Company (and any subsidiary of the Company that is classified as a partnership
for U.S. federal tax purposes) if such election is not already in effect for
the CompanyÂ’s taxable year (or the taxable year of any subsidiary of the
Company that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes)
that includes the Closing Date and that the CompanyÂ’s Tax Returns (and the
Tax Returns of any subsidiary of the Company that is classified as a
partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with such election. For purposes of determining (a)
the adjustments to tax basis of the CompanyÂ’s assets under Section 743(b) of
the Code resulting from the Section 754 Election and (b) the portion of the
gain or loss recognized by the Sellers upon the sale and purchase of the
Units pursuant to this Agreement that is attributable to the CompanyÂ’s
"unrealized receivables" and "inventory items" (as such terms are defined in
Section 751 of the Code), Purchaser, the Sellers and the Representative
agree that the Final Closing Date Purchase Price (excluding any amounts
attributable to the acquisition of the Acquired Shares, but plus other
relevant items required under the Code, including PurchaserÂ’s share of the
liabilities of the Company as determined under Section 752 of the Code) will
be allocated among the CompanyÂ’s assets in accordance with Section 755 of the
Code and the regulations thereunder and consistent with this _Section_ __ _
9.1_. The Representative will deliver its calculation of such allocation to
Purchaser within 60 days after the final determination of the Final Closing
Date Purchase Price (the " _Allocation_ "). In the event that Purchaser
objects to the Allocation, Purchaser shall notify the Representative of its
objection to the Allocation within 30 days of the receipt of the Allocation
and the Parties will endeavor in good faith over the next 15 days to resolve
such dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute within such
15-day period, the Parties shall submit the dispute to the Tax Referee, which
will promptly determine those matters in dispute (based on written
presentations from the parties and not based on its independent review) and
will render a written report as to the disputed matters (the matters
determined by such Tax Referee, together with those matters that were agreed
by the parties, the " _Agreed Allocation_ "). The costs and expenses of the
Tax Referee will be split evenly by Purchaser and the Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers). Purchaser, the Fairway Group Companies, the Blockers
and the Representative will file any Tax Returns and any other governmental
filings on a basis consistent with such allocation of fair market value.
Neither Purchaser nor the Representative nor any of their respective
Affiliates will take any position (whether in Tax audits, Tax Returns, or
other Tax positions) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless required
to do so by applicable Law.

 



46

    

9.7 _Withholding_. Each of Purchaser, the Company and the Escrow Agent,
and their respective agents, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
cash otherwise payable under this Agreement as the applicable paying Person
reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to any such payments under the Code or any other provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ that if Purchaser determines that an
amount is required to be deducted or withheld, Purchaser shall (i) at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the payment of such amount, provide the
Representative with written notice of its intent to deduct and withhold (ii)
cooperate in good faith with the Representative to reduce or eliminate the
deduction or withholding of such amount (including cooperation in seeking
refunds of any amounts withheld), and (iii) shall provide the Representative a
reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other documentation that would
exempt such amounts from withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Person in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made.

 

9.8 _State Income Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
after the Closing, the Representative shall have the right, at its own
expense, to take measures to mitigate any state income Taxes of the Blockers
attributable to the Company Restructuring to the extent such Taxes were
included in Indebtedness, and Purchaser, the Blockers, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate with the Representative in connection
therewith (including by granting to the Representative any necessary powers of
attorney). Such measures (" _State Mitigation Measures_ ") may
include amending state Tax Returns of the Blockers and/or the Fairway Group
Companies and filing ruling requests with applicable state Governmental
Authorities; _provided_ , that the Representative shall provide a copy of any
such draft filings to Purchaser for PurchaserÂ’s review, comment and approval
prior to filing thereof, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. At the RepresentativeÂ’s request, Purchaser shall
promptly submit any such Tax Return amendments, ruling requests or other
filings to the applicable Governmental Authorities which are consistent with
the draft filings reviewed, commented on, and approved by Purchaser described
above. To the extent any State Mitigation Measures result in a reduction in
Taxes that were included in Indebtedness, Purchaser shall promptly following
the "Reimbursement Trigger Date" (as defined below) pay to the Representative
(for the benefit of the Sellers) an amount equal to the excess of (a) Taxes
that were actually included in Indebtedness _over_ (b) Taxes that would have
been included in Indebtedness had the applicable State Mitigation Measure been
made or approved, as the case may be, prior to the Closing. To the extent any
State Mitigation Measures directly result in an increase in Taxes of the
Fairway Group Companies over the amount of Taxes included in Indebtedness,
then Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall promptly pay to Purchaser
an amount equal to the deficit of (a) Taxes that were actually included in
Indebtedness _below_ (b) Taxes that would have been included in Indebtedness
had the applicable State Mitigation Measure been made or approved, as the case
may be, prior to the Closing, but only upon such time as, and to the extent
that, the Purchaser has paid any such Tax deficit to the applicable
Governmental Authorities. For purposes of the foregoing, " _Reimbursement
Trigger Date_ " shall mean the first Business Day that either of the
following shall have occurred, as applicable with respect to a State
Mitigation Measure:1 (i) the amended Tax Return shall have been filed, and
the applicable statute of limitations for audits or challenges thereto by the
applicable Governmental Authority shall have

_Note to Draft_ : The ruling may be received prior to the Tax being actually
paid to Indiana.

47

    

 expired, or (ii) a ruling or similar dispositive written guidance by the
applicable Governmental Authority, but in either case only to the extent final
and binding with respect to the taxpayer requesting such ruling or guidance,
shall have been issued by the applicable Governmental Authority granting the
BlockersÂ’ and/or the Fairway Group CompaniesÂ’ request, as the case may be.

(e) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect

take such other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more
effectively consummate the Transaction.

10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and

consent of such Seller and (y) of any Blocker in  _ARTICLE IV_ without the

failure

 



49

    

 on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. In the event any provision of any other Transaction
Agreement shall in any way conflict with the provisions of this Agreement

invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the

Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the Company, the Representative, the Blockers or the
Sellers on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
the Representative, the Blockers or the Sellers, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement. The Company, the Representative, the Blockers or the Sellers, on
the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, by the Company, the Representative, the Blockers or the Sellers, on
the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement.

10.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse Against Affiliates;
Liability_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to give any rights to any Person or entity other than (i)
the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, (ii) each
DandO Indemnified Person, who shall have the right to enforce the obligations
of Purchaser and the Company solely with respect to _Section_ __ _ 7.7_,
(iii) Fairway 2.0, who shall have the benefit of, and the right to enforce, 
_Section_ __ _ 7.10_, (iv) the Related Parties, who shall have the benefit
of, and the right to enforce, this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_, (v) the Retained
Counsel, who shall have the benefit of, and the right to enforce, _Section_
__ _ 10.15_, (vi) the Seller Parties, who shall have the benefit of, and the
right to enforce, _Section_ __ _ 10.16(a)_, (vii) the Company Persons, who
shall have the benefit of, and the right to enforce, _Section_ __ _
10.16(b)_ and (viii) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. No
Related Party of the Company or any Seller (and no Related Party of any
Related Party), other than the Company, Sellers and the Representative, shall
have any liability (whether in Law or in equity or in contract or in tort) for
any obligations or liabilities of the Company or the Sellers arising under, in
connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the Transaction, including any alleged
nondisclosure or misrepresentations made by any such Persons.

 

10.11 _Assignment_. Neither Party may assign or transfer this Agreement or
any right, interest or obligation hereunder, directly or indirectly (by
operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written approval of
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers),
on the other hand. Any assignment in violation of this  _Section_ __ _

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

10.12 _Cooperation with Legal Proceedings_. From and after the Closing, if
requested by the Representative, Purchaser shall cooperate with the

Proceedings pending or threatened against the Representative, any Seller or

Companies, other than Legal Proceedings where Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates is adverse to the Representative, any Seller or any of their
Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but provided
that such requests shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of Purchaser, Purchaser shall make available its employees to give
depositions or testimony and shall furnish all documentary or other evidence
that the Representative may reasonably request. The Representative shall
reimburse Purchaser for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_.

10.13 _WARN Act Compliance_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall

occurring after the Closing.

 



52

    

10.14 _Authorization of Representative_.

 

(a) The Representative is hereby appointed, authorized and empowered to act
as a representative, for the benefit of the Sellers, as the exclusive agent,
attorney-in-fact, proxy and representative to act on behalf of the Sellers, in
connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the Transaction,
including pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which shall include the power and
authority: (i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (with such
modifications or changes therein as to which the Representative, in its sole
discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments or
modifications thereto as the Representative, in its sole discretion,
determines to be desirable; (ii) __ to execute and deliver such amendments,
waivers and consents in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction and thereby as the
Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; (iii)
__ to collect and receive all moneys and other proceeds and property payable
to the Representative from the Escrow Funds as described herein, and, subject
to any applicable withholding laws, and net of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Representative, the Representative shall disburse and pay the
same to each of the Sellers in accordance with such SellerÂ’s Pro Rata
Percentage; (iv) as the Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of the Sellers and to enforce and protect the rights and interests
of the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements
(including in connection with any and all claims related to Taxes, or claims
related to the Closing Date Working Capital), and to take any and all actions
which the Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under the
Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on behalf of the Sellers,
including asserting or pursuing any claim, action, proceeding or investigation
(a "Claim") against Purchaser and/or any of the Blockers or the Fairway
Group Companies (after the Closing), defending any Claims, consenting to,
compromising or settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with
Purchaser, the Blockers or the Fairway Group Companies (after the Closing) and
their respective representatives regarding such Claims, and, in connection
therewith, to (A) assert or institute any Claim; (B) __ investigate, defend,
contest or litigate any Claim (other than a Claim that solely alleges a breach
of a representation or warranty or a covenant by a single Seller other than
the Representative) initiated by Purchaser, the Blockers or the Fairway Group
Companies (after the Closing) or any other Person, or by any federal, state or
local Governmental Authority against the Representative and/or any of the
Sellers and/or the Escrow Funds, and receive process on behalf of any or all
Sellers in any such Claim and compromise or settle on such terms as the
Representative shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases
and discharges with respect to, any such Claim; (C) __ file any proofs of
debt, claims and petitions as the Representative may deem advisable or
necessary; (D) __ settle or compromise any claims asserted under the Escrow
Agreement; and (E) __ file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment
or award rendered in any such action, proceeding or investigation, it being
understood that the Representative shall not have any obligation to take
any such actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take
any such actions; (v) __ to waive or refrain from enforcing any right of the
Sellers or any of them and/or the Representative arising out of or under or in
any manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing; _provided_
, that no such failure to act on the part of the Representative, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement, shall be
deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the

 



53

    

 Representative or by the Sellers unless such waiver is in writing signed by
the waiving party or by the Representative; and (vi) to make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders,
receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, unit
powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things
and to take any and all action that the Representative, in its sole and
absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in
connection with or to carry out the Transaction; _provided_ , however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Claim that seeks any relief
against or results in any liability against a Seller, any of its Affiliates
or any of their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, or
equityholders (but, for the avoidance of doubt, specifically excluding any
Claim that limits relief to the Escrow Fund), the prior consent of such
Seller shall be required in respect of the settlement or compromise of such
Claim by the Representative. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that the
Representative will allocate the Closing Cash of the Blockers (if any) solely
for the benefit of the applicable Blocker Seller (whether pursuant to _Section
1.3(a)_ or otherwise).

 

(b) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or
other compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall
be entitled to the payment of all its out-of-pocket expenses incurred as the
Representative. In connection with the foregoing, at the Closing, an
aggregate amount of $1,000,000 (the " _Representative Expense Fund_ ") shall
be transferred by or on behalf of the Company to the Representative, to be
used by the Representative to pay expenses incurred by the Representative in
its capacity as the Representative. Once the Representative determines, in its
sole discretion, that the Representative will not incur any additional
expenses in its capacity as the Representative, then the Representative
will distribute the remaining unused Representative Expense Fund, if any, to
the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages. If, however, the
Representative incurs expenses, in its capacity as the Representative, in an
amount exceeding the Representative Expense Fund, then any funds released to
the Representative, in its capacity as the Representative, from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4(e)_, shall be used to reimburse the
Representative for the difference between the total expenses incurred by the
Representative and the Representative Expense Fund. In connection with this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any instrument, agreement or document
relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or
any of the powers conferred upon the Representative hereunder (i) the
Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any of the Sellers
by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or
omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow Agreement or any such other
agreement, instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act
or failure to act which represents willful misconduct, (ii) __
the Representative shall not be liable to Sellers for any apportionment or
distribution of payments made by the Representative in good faith, and if any
such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been
made in error, the sole recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but
not made or not made in full, shall be to recover from the other Sellers any
payment in excess of the amount to which such Seller is determined to have
been entitled, and (iii) __ the Representative shall be entitled to rely on
the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of the Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event
subject the Representative to liability to any of the Sellers. Each Seller
shall indemnify, on a pro rata basis (based on such SellerÂ’s Pro Rata
Percentage), the

 



54

    

 Representative against all Losses (including any and all expense whatsoever
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any
litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of
or in connection with any claim, investigation, challenge, action or
proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or
omissions of the Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or
otherwise. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any
action or proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of the
Representative hereunder for its willful misconduct. In the event of any
indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from the Representative to the
Sellers as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such
indemnification amount, each Seller shall promptly deliver to the
Representative full payment of his, her or its ratable share of the amount of
such deficiency (based on such SellerÂ’s Pro Rata Percentage).

 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by
the Representative pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, all of
which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon the Sellers. The
grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable and survives the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any of the Sellers and (ii) __ shall survive the Closing. Any
amounts received by the Representative on account of all Sellers, whether
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, the Escrow Agreement or otherwise, shall be
distributed to the Sellers, net of any reserve the Representative may deem
necessary in its reasonable discretion, on a pro rata basis (based on each
SellerÂ’s Pro Rata Percentage).

 

(d) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement,
consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Representative that is
expressly within the scope of the RepresentativeÂ’s authority under this
_Section 10.14_ shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Sellers
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Seller;
and Purchaser shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any such notice,
communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a
notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act
within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution
or instruction of, each and every such Seller. Purchaser is hereby relieved
from any liability to any Person for any acts done by Purchaser in accordance
with such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of the Representative.

 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Representative shall
have no liability to, and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any party
hereto in connection with any obligations of the Representative under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or
the Transaction, except to the extent that any act or omission by the
Representative is found by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction
to have constituted fraud or willful misconduct.

 



55

    

(f) The Representative shall have the right to resign, and the Sellers
shall choose the successor representative by affirmative vote of the Sellers
who hold a majority of the voting power of the Company based on their Pro Rata
Percentage. Following such resignation, any reference to the Representative
herein shall be deemed to include such successor representative and prompt
written notice thereof shall be delivered to Purchaser.

 

10.15 _Provisions Respecting Legal Representation_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its respective managers, directors, equityholders, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that the Fairway Group
Companies, the Blockers and the Sellers have retained Kirkland and Ellis LLP
(and its affiliated entity Kirkland __ and Ellis International LLP)
(collectively, the " _Retained Counsel_ ") to act as their counsel in
connection with the Transactions and that the Retained Counsel has not acted
as counsel for any other Party in connection with the Transactions and that
none of the other Parties has the status of a client of the Retained Counsel
for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Purchaser,
the Blockers and the Company hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf
of their respective managers, directors, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Purchaser, the Blockers and/or the Fairway Group
Companies, on the one hand, and the Sellers and/or any of their Affiliates, on
the other hand, the Retained Counsel may represent the Sellers and/or their
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Sellers or their
Affiliates may be directly adverse to Purchaser, the Blockers and/or the
Fairway Group Companies, and even though the Retained Counsel may have
represented the Blockers and/or the Fairway Group Companies in a matter
substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for
Purchaser, the Blockers and/or the Fairway Group Companies.

 

(b) Purchaser agrees that, after the Closing, neither Purchaser, nor any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates will have any right to access or control any
of the Retained CounselÂ’s records relating to or affecting the Transaction
with respect to its representation of the Sellers, the Blockers and/or the
Fairway Group Companies, which will be the property of (and be controlled by)
the Sellers. In addition, Purchaser agrees that it would be impractical to
remove all Attorney-Client Communications from the records (including e-mails
and other electronic files) of the Blockers and the Fairway Group Companies.
Accordingly, Purchaser will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Blockers and the Fairway Group
Companies) not to, use any Attorney-Client Communication remaining in the
records of the Blockers and the Fairway Group Companies after Closing in a
manner that may be adverse to the Sellers or any of the SellersÂ’ Affiliates.
Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Blockers and the Fairway Group
Companies), that from and after Closing (i) the attorney-client privilege, all
other evidentiary privileges, and the expectation of client confidence as to
all Attorney-Client

 



56

    

 Communications belong to the Sellers and will not pass to or be claimed by
Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Blockers or the Fairway Group Companies,
and (ii) the Sellers will have the exclusive right to control, assert or
waive the attorney-client privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the
expectation of client confidence with respect to such Attorney-Client
Communications. Accordingly, Purchaser will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Blockers and the
Fairway Group Companies) not to, (x) __ assert any attorney-client privilege,
other evidentiary privilege, or expectation of client confidence with respect
to any Attorney-Client Communication, except in the event of a post-Closing
dispute with a Person that is not the Sellers or an Affiliate of the Sellers;
or (y) __ take any action which could cause any Attorney-Client
Communication to cease being a confidential communication or to otherwise
lose protection under the attorney-client privilege or any other evidentiary
privilege, including waiving such protection in any dispute with a Person that
is not the Sellers or an Affiliate of the Sellers.

10.16 _Release_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Closing, Purchaser and, from and after the Closing,
the Blockers and the Fairway Group Companies and, in each case, each of their
respective partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
controlling persons, agents, representatives, successors and assigns and the
partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, controlling
persons, agents, representatives, successors and assigns of any of the
foregoing (the " _Purchaser Parties_ ") hereby waives and releases any claims
that the Purchaser Parties currently have or, in the future, may have against
any of the Sellers or any past, present or future equity holder, controlling
person, director, officer, employee, agent, attorney, Affiliate, member,
manager, general or limited partners, stockholder, investor or assignee
of any Seller, or any past, present or future equity holder, controlling
person, director, officer, employee, agent, attorney, Affiliate, member,
manager, general or limited partners, stockholder, investor or assignee of any
of the foregoing (the " _Seller Parties_ "), for any of such PersonÂ’s actions
or omissions prior to the Closing, or otherwise in relation to or arising from
the Blockers or the Fairway Group Companies and their respective pre-Closing
businesses, operations and properties; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
regardless of the foregoing, the Seller Parties shall not be released from any
claim (i) based on Fraud, (ii) __ under or arising out of any post-Closing
obligations of any Seller as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any
other agreement contemplated herein or (iii) __ under or arising out of any
Contract entered into between the Purchaser Parties and the Seller Parties
after the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. Purchaser
hereby acknowledges the release by the Purchaser Parties set forth in the
preceding sentence and covenants and agrees that it will honor such release
and will not, and will cause the Blockers and the Fairway Group Companies not
to, take any action inconsistent therewith (including commencing any Legal
Proceeding with respect to, or directly or indirectly transferring to
another Person, any released claims).

 



57

    

(b) Effective upon the Closing, each Seller and each of their respective
partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, controlling
persons, agents, representatives, successors and assigns and the partners,
members, Affiliates, directors, manager, officers, employees,
controlling persons, agents, representatives, successors and assigns of any
of the foregoing (the " _Seller Group Persons_ ") hereby waives and releases
any claims that the Seller Group Persons currently have or, in the future, may
have against any of the Company or any past, present or future equity holder,
controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent, attorney, Affiliate,
member, manager, general or limited partners, stockholder, investor or
assignee of the Company, or any past, present or future equity holder,
controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent, attorney, Affiliate,
member, manager, general or limited partners, stockholder, investor or
assignee of any of the foregoing (the " _Company Persons_ "), in relation to
such Seller MemberÂ’s capacity as an equity holder of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, regardless of the foregoing, the Seller Group Persons shall
not release any claim (i) based on Fraud, (ii) __ under or arising out of
any post-Closing obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any
other agreement contemplated herein or (iii) __ under or arising out of any
Contract entered into among the Seller Group Persons at or after the Closing,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof. Each Seller hereby acknowledges
the release by the Seller Group Persons set forth in the preceding sentence
and covenants and agrees that it will honor such release and will not, and
will cause its Affiliates not to, take any action inconsistent therewith
(including commencing any Legal Proceeding with respect to, or directly or
indirectly transferring to another Person, any released claims).

 

10.17 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission
(including e-mail), each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. Such delivery of counterparts shall be
conclusive evidence of the intent to be bound hereby and to the extent
applicable, the foregoing constitutes the election of the parties hereto to
invoke any Law authorizing electronic signatures.

herein and made a part hereof as if set forth herein. Any capitalized terms
used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall be
defined as set forth in this Agreement. Any disclosure set forth in one
section of the Schedules shall apply to (i) the representations and warranties
or covenants contained in the Section __ of this Agreement to which
it corresponds in number, (ii) __ any representation and warranty or
covenant to which it is referred by cross reference, and (iii) __ any other
representation or warranty or covenant to the extent it is reasonably apparent
from the wording of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to

include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

 

(e) _Headings_. The provision of the Table of Contents, the division of
this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the
insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any " _Article_ ," " _Section_ " or other

this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

 

(f) _Herein_. The words such as " _herein_ ," " _hereinafter_ ," "
_hereof_ ," " _hereunder_ " and " _hereto_ " refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear unless the
context otherwise requires.

 

(g) _Including_. The word " _including_ " or any variation thereof
means " _including_ , _without limitation_ " and shall not be construed to
limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items
or matters immediately following it.

 

(h) _Made Available_. An item shall be considered " _made available_ " to
a Party hereto, to the extent such phrase appears in this Agreement, only if

specific representation or warranty shall be deemed to be " _reflected on_ "
or " _set forth in_ " a balance sheet, market statement or financial
statements, to the extent any such phrase appears in such representation or
warranty, if (i) there is a reserve, accrual or other similar item underlying
a number on such balance sheet, market statement or financial statements that
related to the subject matter of such representation, (ii) __ such item is
otherwise specifically set forth on the balance sheet, market statement or
financial statements, or (iii) such item is reflected on the balance sheet,
market statement or financial statements and is specifically set forth in the
notes thereto.

(j) _Joint Negotiation and Drafting_. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
