Agreements</U>. Prior to the Closing, the Fairway Group Companies and the Blockers have terminated all Tax sharing or allocation agreements to which any of them was a party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax distribution agreements with
respect to the Company (but not including any Tax distribution or allocation provisions in the Organizational Documents of the Company)) and have caused all amounts owing thereunder to be settled. </P>

Code (and any analogous state or local provision) (the &#147;<U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;754 Election</U>&#148;) shall be made for the Company (and any subsidiary of the Company that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes) if
such election is not already in effect for the Company&#146;s taxable year (or the taxable year of any subsidiary of the Company that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes) that includes the Closing Date and that the
Company&#146;s Tax Returns (and the Tax Returns of any subsidiary of the Company that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with such election. For purposes of determining (a)&nbsp;the
adjustments to tax basis of the Company&#146;s assets under Section&nbsp;743(b) of the Code resulting from the Section&nbsp;754 Election and (b)&nbsp;the portion of the gain or loss recognized by the Sellers upon the sale and purchase of the Units
pursuant to this Agreement that is attributable to the Company&#146;s &#147;unrealized receivables&#148; and &#147;inventory items&#148; (as such terms are defined in Section&nbsp;751 of the Code), Purchaser, the Sellers and the Representative agree
that the Final Closing Date Purchase Price (excluding any amounts attributable to the acquisition of the Acquired Shares, but plus other relevant items required under the Code, including Purchaser&#146;s share of the liabilities of the Company as
determined under Section&nbsp;752 of the Code) will be allocated among the Company&#146;s assets in accordance with Section&nbsp;755 of the Code and the regulations thereunder and consistent with this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;9.1</U>. The
Representative will deliver its calculation of such allocation to Purchaser within 60 days after the final determination of the Final Closing Date Purchase Price (the &#147;<U>Allocation</U>&#148;). In the event that Purchaser objects to the
Allocation, Purchaser shall notify the Representative of its objection to the Allocation within 30 days of the receipt of the Allocation and the Parties will endeavor in good faith over the next 15 days to resolve such dispute. If the Parties are
unable to resolve such dispute within such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">15-day</FONT> period, the Parties shall submit the dispute to the Tax Referee, which will promptly determine those matters in dispute (based on written presentations from
the parties and not based on its independent review) and will render a written report as to the disputed matters (the matters determined by such Tax Referee, together with those matters that were agreed by the parties, the &#147;<U>Agreed
Allocation</U>&#148;). The costs and expenses of the Tax Referee will be split evenly by Purchaser and the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). Purchaser, the Fairway Group Companies, the Blockers and the Representative will file any Tax
Returns and any other governmental filings on a basis consistent with such allocation of fair market value. Neither Purchaser nor the Representative nor any of their respective Affiliates will take any position (whether in Tax audits, Tax Returns,
or other Tax positions) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law. </P>

amendments, ruling requests or other filings to the applicable Governmental Authorities which are consistent with the draft filings reviewed, commented on, and approved by Purchaser described above. To the extent any State Mitigation Measures result
in a reduction in Taxes that were included in Indebtedness, Purchaser shall promptly following the &#147;Reimbursement Trigger Date&#148; (as defined below) pay to the Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers) an amount equal to the excess of
