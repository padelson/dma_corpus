(b)  At any time or from time to time between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, if Parent declares or pays any dividend on
Parent Common Stock payable in Parent Common Stock or in any right to acquire
Parent Common Stock, or effects a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Parent Common Stock (by
stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like), or if
the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be combined
or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, then the Parent Share Price (including the
dollar amounts referred to in the definition of Parent Share Price) and the
Share Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(c)  No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall, upon surrender of such
holder's Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid in cash the dollar amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the Parent Share Price.

  



  

(d)  As soon as possible, but in any event no later than three
(3) business days, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to
Parent and the Exchange Agent the Spreadsheet. For purposes of this Agreement,

immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) the fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock into which one share of Company Common Stock shall be
converted as a result of the Merger; (ii) for each series of Company Preferred
Stock, the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock into which one share of
such series of Company Preferred Stock shall be converted as a result of the
Merger; (iii) the dollar value of one share of Company Common Stock in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Implied
Merger Consideration Per Company Common Share_ "); (iv) (A) the names of all
Company Stockholders and their respective addresses, (B) the number and type
of shares of Company Capital Stock held by each Company Stockholder, (C) where
applicable, the respective certificate numbers held by each Company
Stockholder, and (D) the number of Closing Total Merger Shares to be paid to
each Company Stockholder at Closing in respect of each type of shares of
Company Capital Stock held by such Company Stockholder; (v) (A) the names of
all holders of Company Options and their respective addresses, (B) the number
and type of shares of Company Capital Stock underlying each Company Option
held by each such holder, (C) the grant date, expiration date, exercise price
per share, vesting schedule and vested status of each Company Option held by
each such holder and (D) the number of Company Option Settlement
Shares issuable with respect to such Company Option in accordance with
_Section 1.9(a)(i)_ ; (vi) (A) the names of all holders of Company Warrants
and their respective addresses; (B) the number and type of shares of Company
Capital Stock underlying the Company Warrants held by each such holder, (C)

be exercisable as a result of _Section 1.9(b)_ , and (E) the exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock of such Company Warrant as a result of
_Section 1.9(b)_ ; _provided_ , that all such calculations shall be made in
accordance with (1) Section 2.1 of Article 4B of the Company's Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation dated June 8, 2012 (the " _Restated

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent shall not be obligated to issue shares of Parent Common
Stock to any Merger Stockholder or holder of Company Options that Parent, in
its sole discretion, does not reasonably believe is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities
Act (each, a " _Non-Accredited Company Stockholder_ ") if the issuance of
such shares would result in the issuance of shares by Parent to more than
thirty-five (35) Non-Accredited Company Stockholders. In lieu of issuing such
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such Non-Accredited Company
Stockholder would otherwise be entitled under _Sections 1.5(a)_ (subject, in
all cases, to the exchange procedures set forth in _Section 1.7_ hereof) or
_1.9(a)_ , Parent may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay to such Non-
Accredited Company Stockholder an amount in cash (the " _Substitute Cash
Amount_ ") equal to the product of (i) such number of Closing Net Merger
Shares or Company Option Settlement Shares, as the case may be, to which such
Non-Accredited Company Stockholder is entitled under _Section 1.5(a)_ or
_1.9(a)_ , and (ii) the Parent Share Price; _provided_ , that such portion of
the Substitute Cash Amount payable to any Merger Stockholder which would
otherwise be treated as Escrow Shares pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(ii)_ shall
be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to all terms applicable to
Escrow Shares set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

1.6   _Closing of the Company 's Transfer Books_. At the
Effective Time, holders of certificates representing shares of Company
Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
such Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. No further transfer of any such shares of the Company Capital Stock
shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, a Company Stock Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented by such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock, as provided in _Section 1.5_ and
_1.7_.

  



  

1.7   _Exchange of Certificates._

  



  

(a)  On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Company
shall agree upon, select and engage a reputable bank, transfer agent or trust
company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent stock
certificates representing the Closing Net Merger Shares, other than
the Escrow Shares, and the Company Option Settlement Shares.

  



  

(b)  At the Closing, each Company Stockholder that does not

such holder shall execute and deliver an Option Holder Letter of Transmittal),
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) (A)

(i)  As soon as practicable, but in any event no later than
ninety (90) days, after the Closing, Parent shall deliver to Stockholders'
Agent a statement (a " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth, as of the
Adjustment Calculation Time, (A) the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (B) the Closing Date Working
Capital (the " _Final Working Capital_ ") and (C) the Indebtedness (the "
_Final Indebtedness_ "). The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with the preparation of the
Financial Statements. The amount, if any, by which the Final Working Capital

to herein as the " _Final Working Capital Shortfall_ ," and the amount, if

Working Capital Target shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Working

(ii)  For a period of thirty (30) days following the date on

Stockholders' Agent may, within thirty (30) days after the Delivery Date,
deliver a notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to Parent setting forth the
Stockholders' Agent's calculation of such items (including reasonable detail
regarding the calculation of such items). If the Stockholders' Agent does not
deliver an Objection Notice within such thirty (30) day period, then the
Closing Statement prepared by Parent shall be deemed to have been accepted by
the Stockholders' Agent. If the Stockholders' Agent delivers an Objection
Notice, Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall use each of its reasonable
best efforts to resolve any disagreements, but if they do not obtain a final
resolution within thirty (30) days after Parent has received the Objection
Notice, Parent and the Stockholders' Agent, shall jointly retain
PriceWaterhouseCoopers (the " _Accountant_ ") to resolve any remaining
disagreements within thirty (30) days of its engagement. The Accountant's
determination shall be based upon the terms of this Agreement and shall,
absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. The

determined in accordance with this _Section 1.14(b)(iii)_ shall be referred
to herein as the " _Determination Date_."

  



  

(iv)   If the number of Final Net Merger Shares is greater than
the number of Closing Net Merger Shares, within five (5) business days of the
Determination Date, Parent shall issue and cause to be delivered to the Merger
Stockholders such number of shares of Parent Common Stock, in the aggregate,
equal to such difference, in accordance with their respective holdings of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. If
the number of Final Net Merger Shares is less than the number of Closing Net
Merger Shares, within five (5) business days of the Determination Date, the
Stockholders' Agent and Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to deliver to
Parent such number of Escrow Shares equal to such difference in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

returns and reports) as required by law. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects and were prepared in substantial compliance
with all applicable Legal Requirements. Except as set forth on _Section 2.13_
of the Schedule of Exceptions, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
paid all material Taxes and other assessments due (whether or not shown on a
Tax Return), except those contested by it in good faith with respect to which
(i) an adequate reserve therefor has been established and is maintained in
accordance with GAAP and (ii) there has been no action to foreclose a lien
on the Company's or any Subsidiary's property as a result of such unpaid
Taxes. There are no Encumbrances on any of the assets of the Company or any

or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. There is no dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries either (a) claimed or raised by any
Governmental Body in writing or (b) as to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has knowledge.

has occurred that, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a
breach or default, or permit termination, modification, or acceleration,
under the policy; and (D) no party to the policy has repudiated any provision
thereof.

Subsidiary's business by the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor the conduct of the Company's or any Subsidiary's
business as now conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted, will, to

Share Price (such amount, the " _Cap_ ").

  



  

(ii)  The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
any payment of any amount under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or  _(ii)_ (other than
for breaches of Fundamental Representations) until such time as the total
amount of all such Damages that have been directly or indirectly suffered or
incurred by any one or more of the Parent Indemnified Parties, or to which any

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 10 (but in any case subject to _Section 10.3_ ), except with respect

monetary Damages with respect to any breach of the representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement. The exercise by any
Person of any of its rights under this _Section 10_ shall not be deemed to be
an election of remedies and shall not be deemed to prejudice, or to
constitute or operate as a waiver of, any injunctive or other equitable right,
remedy or relief that such Person may be entitled to exercise.

  



  

10.4   _No Contribution_. Upon consummation of the Merger, each
Merger Stockholder will be deemed to have waived any right of contribution,
right of indemnity or other right or remedy against Merger Sub, the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries in connection with any indemnification
obligation or any other liability to which he, she or it may become subject
under or in connection with this Agreement.

Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall
deliver notice thereof to the Stockholders' Agent, or to Parent, as applicable
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ "); _provided_ , __ that no delay or failure on
the part of an Indemnified Party in notifying the Stockholders' Agent or
Parent, as the case may be, shall relieve an Indemnifying Party from its
obligations hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is thereby materially
prejudiced (and then solely to the extent of such prejudice).

  



  

(b)  The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written
notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice
from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to
assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period set
forth in this _Section 10.5(b)_ , the Indemnified Party shall have the sole
right to assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement,
compromise or judgment (i) involves a finding or admission of
wrongdoing, (ii) does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect
of such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any
obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money
damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder.

10.6   _Claims Relating to Securities_. If (a) prior to the Effective
Time, any Person asserts or commences, or threatens to assert or commence, a
claim or Legal Proceeding on the basis that such Person is entitled to acquire
or receive, or is the owner of, shares of Company Capital Stock or securities
convertible into shares of Company Capital Stock, and (b) notwithstanding
such claim or Legal Proceeding the Closing occurs, then (i) the shares or
other securities that are the basis of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall
be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of determining the Share Exchange
Ratio; (ii) Parent shall not be required to issue or deliver any shares of
Parent Common Stock in respect of such claim or Legal Proceeding (or the
shares or other securities forming the basis of such claim or Legal
Proceeding) until such claim or Legal Proceeding is finally resolved or
settled, which settlement shall not be entered into without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders' Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld); and (iii) after such claim or Legal Proceeding is finally resolved,
any shares of Parent Common Stock being held by Parent in respect of such
claim or Legal Proceeding that are not delivered to the Person making such
claim or Legal Proceeding or otherwise retained by Parent in accordance with
this _Section 10.6_ shall be distributed to the Merger Stockholders and the
Escrow Agent as if such shares were issuable at the Closing in accordance with
_Section 1_. If a claim or Legal Proceeding of the type referred to in this
_Section 10.6_ is settled by the payment of cash, Parent shall be entitled to
retain pursuant to this _Section 10.6_ , a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by dividing (A) the sum of (1) the amount of cash payable to
the Person who asserted such claim or Legal Proceeding in respect of the
settlement of such claim or Legal Proceeding and (2) the amount of any legal
fees and other expenses incurred by Parent or its Subsidiary in connection
with such claim or Legal Proceeding, by (B) the Parent Stock Price.

  



  

10.7   _Security Interest in Escrow._

  



  

(a)  As collateral security for the prompt and complete payment
and performance when due of each of the Merger Stockholders' indemnification,
reimbursement and compensation obligations to each Parent Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Section 10_ , and in order to induce Parent to enter into
this Agreement, each Merger Stockholder hereby grants to Parent a security
interest in all of the Merger Stockholder's right, title and interest in and
to the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Account (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) and all accessions to, substitutions and replacements for, and
proceeds thereof. At any time and from time to time, upon the written request
of Parent, and at the sole expense of the Merger Stockholders, the Company
shall promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such further
instruments and documents and take such further action as Parent may
reasonably deem desirable to obtain the full benefits of the security
interest granted hereby, including, (a) executing, delivering and causing to

continuation statements) under the applicable Uniform Commercial Code with
respect to the security interests granted hereby, and (b) executing and
delivering and causing the Escrow Agent, or any other applicable depository
institution, securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, to execute
and deliver a collateral control agreement in order to perfect the security
interest created hereunder in favor of Parent (including giving Parent
"control" over such Collateral within the meaning of the applicable provisions
of Article 8 and Article 9 of the UCC). Each Company Stockholder also hereby
authorizes Parent to file any such financing or continuation statement
(including "in lieu" continuation statements) without the signature of such
Merger Stockholder.

Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), then upon the Termination Date the
security interest granted under this _Section 10.7_ shall terminate and Parent
shall release all of its interest in and to the Escrow Shares and the Escrow
Account. In the event such a Claim has not been resolved prior to the
Termination Date, the security interest granted under this _Section 10.7_
shall continue until such time as the Claim is resolved in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement, at which time the security interest granted under this
_Section 10.7_  shall terminate and Parent shall release all of its interest
in and to the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Account. Upon such termination of
the security interest granted under this _Section 10.7_ , Parent shall execute
such terminations of any financing statements or other documents required to
evidence such termination of the security interest.

Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 10_

Agent, direct the Escrow Agent to release and transfer to Parent the
number of Escrow Shares having an aggregate value on the date thereof equal
to the amount owed to the Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
10_ in satisfaction of such claim. For purposes hereof, the value of each
Escrow Share shall be equal to the Parent Share Price.

the contrary, for purposes of determining the amount of Damages that are the
subject matter of a claim for indemnification or reimbursement hereunder, each
representation and warranty in this Agreement, the Schedule of Exceptions,

regard and without giving effect to the term "material," "Material Adverse

warranty.

other Parent Indemnified Party based on any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement,

deemed waived by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.
