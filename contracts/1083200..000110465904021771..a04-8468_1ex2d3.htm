 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

 ** **

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of June
14, 2004, by and among United Industries Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), Saturn MergerCo., Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _MergerCo_
"), and United Pet Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").
Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 10.8 hereof.
An index of defined terms used in this Agreement is attached as _Annex A_
 hereto.

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties wish to effect a business combination through a merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of MergerCo with and into the Company on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, TA Associates,
Inc. and Friend Skoler and Co., LLC (together, the " _Major Stockholders_ ")
and certain other holders of the Companys capital stock have entered into a
separate agreement (the " _Selling Shareholders Agreement_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the
best interest of its stockholders;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and MergerCo have determined that
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are in the best interest of their respective stockholders, and
Parent has approved this Agreement as the sole stockholder of MergerCo; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, MergerCo and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger, and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants herein
contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  



  

 ** _ARTICLE I - THE MERGER_**

  



  

 **Section 1.1** **.** ** _The Merger_.** Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.2 below), the Company and MergerCo shall consummate the Merger pursuant to
which (a) MergerCo shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of MergerCo shall thereupon cease, (b) the
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware, and (c) the separate corporate

  

      
   



  

existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall
have the effects specified in the DGCL.

  



  

 **Section 1.2** **.** ** _Effective Time_.** On the Closing Date
(as defined in Section 1.4 below), MergerCo and the Company shall duly
execute a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and file
such Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger, accompanied by payment of the filing
fee (as provided in the DGCL), has been examined by and received the endorsed
approval of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  



  

 **Section 1.3** **.** ** _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_.** The
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at
the Effective Time to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of
MergerCo (except for those provisions dealing with the incorporator and
initial directors, which shall be omitted and the name of the Surviving
Corporation which shall be as set forth in the last sentence of this Section
1.3) until thereafter amended as provided by law and the terms of such
certificate of incorporation. The by-laws of MergerCo, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, by the
terms of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and by
the terms of such by-laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be "United Pet Group, Inc." and the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall
so provide.

  



  

 **Section 1.4** **.** ** _Closing_.** Subject to satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VIII, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall occur on August 16, 2004; _provided_ , that if the
conditions set forth in Article VIII have not been satisfied on such date,
then the Closing shall occur as promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than the third Business Day (as defined below)) after the conditions
set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied; and _provided_ _further_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing the Closing may occur on any other date
agreed upon by the parties. The date that the Closing occurs pursuant to the
foregoing sentence is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."
 The Closing shall take place at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP,
599 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022, or at such other place as agreed to
by the parties hereto. " _Business Day_ " means any day other than a day on
which the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the office of
the Delaware Secretary of State is closed.

  



  

 **Section 1.5** **.** ** _Directors and Officers_.** The directors

 ** _ARTICLE II - EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS_**

  



  

 **Section 2.1** **.** ** _Effect on Capital Stock_.** As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company (the " _Company
Stock_ ") or any shares of the capital stock of MergerCo:

  



  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation following the Merger.

  



  

(b) (i) Each share of Company Stock that is owned by the Company or by any
wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 10.8) of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) each share of Company Stock
that is owned by Parent, by MergerCo, or by any other wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent immediately prior to the Closing Date (such shares of Company Stock
described in subsection (ii) being herein referred to as " _Rollover Shares_
") shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b), the Dissenting Shares as defined in Section 3.2 below,
and unvested shares of restricted Company Stock that are repurchased by the
Company as of the Effective Date pursuant to the terms of the
restricted stock agreements pertaining to such shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration (as
defined below) applicable to such share, calculated as of the Effective Time
in accordance with the formulae illustrated on _Exhibit A_ hereto, net to the
holder thereof in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender and exchange of the Certificate (as defined below)
representing such share of Company Stock or the delivery of an affidavit as
described in Section 3.1(h).

  



  

(i) Subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.5, the " _Merger
Consideration_ " shall be an amount equal to (A) $360,000,000, plus (B) the
Aggregate Option Proceeds, the Aggregate Warrant Proceeds, and the Aggregate
Promissory Note Proceeds (each as defined in Section 2.1(c)(ii) below), less
(C) the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries outstanding as of the Closing, less (D) all Company Expenses,
**** and **** less (E) the Estimated Underage, if any.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) that portion of the Merger
Consideration to be received by each stockholder of the Company listed as an
"Optionholder" or "Warrantholder" on _Exhibit A_ hereto shall be reduced by
the aggregate exercise price payable by such stockholder at Closing upon the
exercise of such Optionholders Options (as defined in Section 2.2 below) or
such

  



  

3      
   



  

Warrantholders warrants, as the case may be (collectively, the " _Aggregate
Option Proceeds_ " and " _Aggregate Warrant Proceeds_ ," respectively), (B)
that portion of the Merger Consideration to be received by each stockholder
of the Company listed as a "Restricted Stock Holder" on _Exhibit A_ hereto
shall be reduced by the outstanding principal and accrued interest payable by
such stockholder at Closing pursuant to the terms of such Restricted Stock
Holders promissory notes in favor of the Company (collectively, the "
_Aggregate Promissory Note Proceeds_ "), and (C) the portion of the Merger
Consideration to be received by each Stockholder who has, pursuant to a
written agreement with Parent, transferred Rollover Shares to Parent,
MergerCo, or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be reduced by the portion of the Merger
Consideration that would have been paid in respect of such Rollover Shares if
such Rollover Shares had not been transferred to Parent, MergerCo, or any
other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the amount aggregated for all such
Stockholders, the " _Rollover Share Value_ ").

  



  

(iii) At least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, the Companys Chief
Executive Officer shall deliver to Parent and MergerCo a good faith estimate
of the Companys Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing
(the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), together with supporting
documentation for such estimate and any additional information reasonably
requested by Parent or MergerCo. An " _Estimated Underage_ " will be deemed
to exist (and will equal the amount by which) the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than the Base Amount.

  



  

(d) All shares of Company Stock, when converted as provided in Section
2.1(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (" _Certificate_
") previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration applicable to the
shares underlying such Certificate, as set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto. The
holders of Certificates previously evidencing shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to the Company Stock except as otherwise provided herein
or by law and, upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.1, shall only represent the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for their shares of Company
Stock.

  



  

 **Section 2.2.** ** _Company Stock Options and Related Matters_.**

  



  

(a) Any option to purchase shares of Company Stock (collectively, the "
_Options_ ") that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall (i) if granted under the Companys Second Amended and
Restated 1997 Stock Option and Grant Plan (the " _Plan_ "), become fully
vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, if its terms so provide, and
terminate as of the Effective Time in accordance with its terms and the Plan
and (ii) if not granted under the Plan, terminate as of the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms. The Merger Consideration to be received for
shares receivable upon exercise of Options as of the Effective Time (after
the reduction

  



  

4      
   



  

described in Section 2.1(c)(ii)(A) above applicable to such Options) shall be
treated as compensation by the Company and shall be net of any applicable
federal, state or local withholding tax.

  



  

(b) Parent and MergerCo acknowledge that all shares of Company Stock granted
pursuant to restricted stock awards under the Plan that are unvested
immediately prior to the approval of this Agreement by the Companys
stockholders and that are not repurchased by the Company pursuant to the
terms of the applicable restricted stock award and the Plan, shall
immediately vest and the restrictions associated therewith shall
automatically be deemed waived as provided by the Plan.

  



  

 **Section 2.3** **.** ** _Payments at Closing for Indebtedness_.**

  



  

(a) As of the Closing Date, Parent and MergerCo shall provide sufficient
funds to the Surviving Corporation to enable the Surviving Corporation to

that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of July 20, 1999, by and among
the Company, various lending institutions, Fleet National Bank, as
administrative agent, and Fleet Securities, Inc., as lead arranger and book
manager, as amended and restated as of June 13, 2003.  The Company, Parent
and MergerCo will cooperate in arranging for such repayment and shall take
such reasonable actions as may be necessary to facilitate such repayment and
to facilitate the release, in connection with such repayment, of any
Encumbrances (as defined in Section 10.8) securing such Senior Indebtedness.

  



  

(b) As of the Closing Date, Parent and MergerCo shall provide sufficient
funds to the Surviving Corporation to enable the Surviving Corporation to
repay all Indebtedness (the " _Subordinated Indebtedness_ ") then outstanding
under (i) that certain Senior Subordinated Loan Agreement, dated as of July
20, 1999, by and among the Company, various lending institutions and
Gleacher Capital, LLC, as arranger, as amended, and (ii) that certain Amended
and Restated Subordinated Promissory Note, dated as of July 29, 1999, made
by the Company in favor of the Robert M. Sherman and Yvonne F. Sherman Inter-
Vivos Trust U/T/A dated November 18, 1986.  The Company, Parent and MergerCo
will cooperate in arranging for such repayment and shall take such reasonable
actions as may be necessary to facilitate such repayment and to facilitate
the release, in connection with such repayment, of any Encumbrances securing
such Subordinated Indebtedness.

  



  

 **Section 2.4** **.** ** _Payments at Closing for Expenses_.** As of the
Closing Date, Parent and MergerCo shall provide sufficient funds to the
Surviving Corporation to enable the Surviving Corporation to pay all Company
Expenses that have not been paid on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

 **Section 2.5** **.** ** _Working Capital Adjustment_.**

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement of Net Working
Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Statement_ ").
The Stockholder

  



  

5      
   



  

Representative shall have fifteen (15) days following its receipt of the
Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the same. On or before
the expiration of the Review Period, the Stockholder Representative shall
deliver to Parent a written statement accepting or objecting to
the calculation of Net Working Capital set forth on the Closing Statement. In
the event that the Stockholder Representative shall object to the Closing
Statement, such statement shall include a detailed itemization of the
Stockholder Representatives objections and the reasons therefor. If
the Stockholder Representative does not deliver such statement to Parent
within the Review Period, the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to
have accepted the Closing Statement.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall accept or shall be
deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement as prepared and delivered by
Parent, the Net Working Capital set forth on the Closing Statement shall
constitute the "Final Net Working Capital" for purposes of determining any
adjustment to the Merger Consideration. In the event, however, that the
Stockholder Representative shall object to the Closing Statement within the
Review Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly meet
and in good faith attempt to resolve such objections. Any such objections
which cannot be resolved between Parent and the Stockholder Representative
within thirty (30) days following the Parents receipt of the Stockholder
Representatives statement of objections shall be resolved in accordance with
Section 2.5(c). The Net Working Capital set forth on the Closing Statement,
as adjusted to reflect any adjustments agreed upon by the parties, as deemed
accepted under Section 2.5(a) or as determined in accordance with Section
2.5(c), shall constitute the "Final Net Working Capital" for purposes of
determining any adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) Should the Stockholder Representative and Parent not be able to resolve
such objections as may be raised with respect to the Closing Statement,
within the thirty (30) day period described in Section 2.5(b), either party
may submit the matter to KPMG LLP (the " _Arbitrator_ ") for review
and resolution, with instructions to complete the same as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of its engagement, and
to make any calculations in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and consistent with the Companys historical practice. The fees
and costs of the Arbitrator, if one is required, shall be borne
proportionally **** by the stockholders of the Company (and payable out of
the Working Capital Escrow Amount (as defined in Section 2.6)) and Parent, on
the basis, for each such party, of the ratio of the positive difference
between the amount submitted by such party and the determination made by the
Arbitrator to the difference between the amounts submitted by each party.

  



  

(d) In the event that (i) the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Base
Amount (the amount obtained by subtracting the Final Net Working Capital from
the Base Amount being referred to herein as the " _Net Working Capital
Shortfall_ ") and (ii) the Net Working Capital Shortfall is greater than the
Estimated Underage, within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the
Final Net Working Capital, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent from the
Working Capital Escrow Amount an amount equal to the difference obtained by
subtracting (A) the Estimated Underage from (ii) the Net Working Capital
Shortfall. In the event that (i) the Final Net Working Capital is less than
the Base

  



  

6      
   



  

Amount and (ii) the Net Working Capital Shortfall is less than the Estimated
Underage, within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final Net
Working Capital, Parent shall pay the Exchange Agent an amount equal to the
difference obtained by subtracting (A) the Net Working Capital Shortfall from
(ii) the Estimated Underage. In the event that the Final Net Working Capital
equals or is greater than the Base Amount (the amount obtained by subtracting
the Base Amount from the Final Net Working Capital being referred to herein
as the " _Net Working Capital Overage_ "), within five (5) Business Days of
the determination of the Final Net Working Capital, the Parent shall pay to
the Exchange Agent an amount equal to the sum of (x) the Net Working Capital
Overage plus (y) the Estimated Underage, if any (as calculated, the "
_Aggregate Net Working Capital Overage_ ").

  



  

 **Section 2.6** **.** ** _Working Capital Escrow_.** At the Effective Time,
Parent shall pay to Mellon Trust of New England, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_
") an amount in cash equal to $2,500,000 (the " _Working Capital Escrow
Amount_ ") of the Merger Consideration. The Working Capital Escrow Amount
will be held by the Escrow Agent pending calculation of the Final Net Working
Capital as set forth in Section 2.5. Any portion of the Working Capital Escrow
Amount remaining after calculation of the Final Net Working Capital pursuant
to Section 2.5 and payments, if any, to Parent in accordance with Section 2.5
hereof, shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent (or to the
Surviving Corporation if the Exchange Agent has distributed all remaining
funds in accordance with Section 3.1(e)) and then by the Exchange Agent (or
the Surviving Corporation if it has succeeded to the obligations of the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.1(e)) to the holders of shares of
Company Stock as provided in Section 3.1. Pending such payments, the
Exchange Agent shall, as directed by Parent, invest the Working Escrow Amount
in short term obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed by, the United
States of America, or any agency of the United States. Until distributed by
the Escrow Agent, all amounts included in the Working Capital Escrow Amount
shall be the property of Parent and Parent shall be entitled to receive
interest or earnings thereon, if any.

  



  

 ** _ARTICLE III - PAYMENT FOR SHARES; DISSENTING SHARES_**

  



  

 **Section 3.1** **.** ** _Payment for Shares of Company Stock_.**

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company as shall be mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Stock for exchange through the Exchange Agent,
the aggregate Merger Consideration as provided pursuant to Section 2.1(c),
less the Working Capital Escrow Amount, and less the Aggregate Option
Proceeds, the Aggregate Warrant Proceeds, the Aggregate Promissory Note
Proceeds, and the Rollover Share Value (each of which shall be treated as
provided in Section 2.1(c)(ii)) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver
or mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Stock (i) a form of letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to
the Company which shall specify that

  



  

7      
   



  

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, including any amounts that may be
payable in accordance with the adjustments provided in Section 2.5, as
calculated in accordance with Section 2.1(c), that such holder has the right
to receive in respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Certificates.

  



  

(d) Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 3.1, each such
Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares of Company Stock to
be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b), Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 3.2) and unvested shares of restricted Company Stock that
are repurchased by the Company as of the Effective Date pursuant to the terms
of the restricted stock agreements pertaining to such shares) shall
represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration relating
thereto. If the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) is to be
delivered to any person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
formerly representing shares of Company Stock surrendered therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such Merger
Consideration that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person surrendering
such shares of Company Stock shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

(e) Promptly following the date that is ninety (90) days after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all
cash, Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
Merger, and the Exchange Agents duties shall terminate.  Thereafter, each
holder of a Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Stock may
surrender such Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive
in consideration therefor the Merger Consideration relating thereto.

  



  

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and, thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of any shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be surrendered and canceled
in return for the payment of the Merger Consideration relating thereto, as
provided in this Article III.

  



  

8      
   



  

(g) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue the applicable
Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

  



  

(i) Parent and the Company shall cooperate to determine the amount of Tax
required to be withheld with respect to any payments to be made pursuant to
this Agreement that will be treated as compensation income to the recipient
thereof for any relevant tax purposes, determined as if the Company was the
payor of such amounts. Parent shall withhold such amounts from the portion
of the Merger Consideration otherwise due to the recipient with respect to
which such withholding is required, and shall instead pay such amount to the
Company for payment to the applicable Tax authority. To the extent that
Parent fails to withhold and pay to the Company any amounts provided for in
this Section 3.1(i), then any Taxes, including any interest and
penalties thereon, imposed or imposable upon the Company in respect of such
amounts shall not be considered a liability of the Company for purposes of
determining the Net Working Capital of the Company. In addition, the
Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Stock
or Options such amounts as the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or any provision of United States federal, state or local tax
laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such amounts withheld shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Stock or Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

 **Section 3.2** **.** ** _Appraisal Rights_.**

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Stock (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders of the Company who have not consented in the Written Consent (as
defined in Section 7.1) in favor of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal
Rights Provisions_ ") will not be converted as described in Section 2.1,
but will thereafter constitute only the right to receive payment of the fair
value of such shares of Company Stock in accordance with the Appraisal
Rights Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that all shares of Company
Stock held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall thereupon
be

  



  

9      
   



  

deemed to have been canceled and retired and to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest, in the manner provided in Section 2.1.
 Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to
Dissenting Shares as aforesaid will not be paid by the Surviving Corporation
as provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are provided
by the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting Shares.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent,
MergerCo or the Company abandon or are finally enjoined or prevented from
carrying out, or the stockholders rescind their adoption and approval of,
this Agreement, the right of each holder of Dissenting Shares to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights
Provisions will terminate, effective as of the time of such abandonment,
injunction, prevention or rescission. The Company shall give Parent and
MergerCo prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for the
exercise of appraisal rights with respect to shares of Company Stock and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands.

  



  

(b) Each dissenting stockholder who becomes entitled under the DGCL to
payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor after the
Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation (but only after the amount
thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the
DGCL), and such shares of Company Stock shall be canceled.

or is obligated to contribute thereunder on behalf of current or former
employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which
there can be any current or future liability (the " _Company Plans_ ").
Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any trade or business

401 of the Code are so qualified and the trusts maintained pursuant thereto
are exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code, and,
to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred with respect to the
operation of the Company Plans which could reasonably be expected to cause
the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any
liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.

the Company Plans with respect to the operation of such plans (other than
routine benefit claims), nor does the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have
knowledge of facts which could form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit.

or taken until a date after the Closing Date.

  



  

(h) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on
_Schedule 4.9(h)_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in
any payment becoming due to any employee (current, former or retired) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Company Plan or (iii) result in the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any such plan.

with any person or firm that may result in the obligation of such entity or
Parent or MergerCo to pay any finders fees, brokerage or agents commissions

material Permits which are required for the operation of their respective
businesses as presently conducted. None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is in default or violation, and no event has occurred which,
with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation, in any material respect of any term, condition or provision of any
Permit to which it is a party, to which its business is subject or by which
its properties or assets are bound, and to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no facts or circumstances which could form the basis for any such
default or violation.

delivered by the Company or any Subsidiary has been subject to any product
warranty beyond the applicable standard product warranties which are set
forth in _Schedule 4.22_, except for any product warranty the compliance
with which would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Schedule 4.22_ sets forth
the aggregate expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
fulfilling their product warranty obligations during each year since December
31, 2000. The Company has no reason to believe that warranty expense as a
percentage of sales will increase materially in the future.

  



  

 **Section 4.23** **.** ** _Product Compliance_.** _Schedule 4.23_
identifies each product recall (whether voluntary or compulsory), and the
circumstances surrounding each recall, involving any products of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2000. No product

  



  

24      
   



  

manufactured, sold, leased, licensed or delivered by the Company or the
Subsidiary is subject to a recall required by any Governmental Authority and
neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has any plans to initiate a voluntary
product recall. To the Companys knowledge, each type of product
manufactured, sold, leased, licensed or delivered by the Company or
any Subsidiary conforms with all applicable laws (including rules and
regulations thereunder) currently in effect of any federal, state, local
government of the United States, or any Governmental Authority, and with the
applicable requirements of industry standard organizations, except where the
failure to comply therewith would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has complied with all
applicable rules, regulations and reporting requirements currently in effect

Environmental Protection Agency, except where the failure to comply therewith
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

warranty made by the Company herein refers to the knowledge of the Company,

of the senior management of the Company listed on _Schedule 4.24_.

  



  

 ** _ARTICLE V - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF 
 PARENT AND MERGERCO_**

  



  

Parent and MergerCo hereby jointly and severally make to the Company the
representations and warranties contained in this Article V.

  



  

 **Section 5.1** **.** ** _Organization_.** Parent is a corporation duly

properties and to carry on its respective business as currently conducted.
Each of Parent and MergerCo is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation under the laws of each jurisdiction set forth on
_Schedule 5.1_ and each other jurisdiction in which the character of its
properties or in which the transaction of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. " _Parent Material Adverse
Effect_ " means (i) a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
properties, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise after
the date hereof) of the Parent and MergerCo, taken as a whole, except for any
such effects resulting from (i) this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby or the announcement thereof or (ii) changes in general economic or
political conditions or the securities markets in the United States (whether
as a result of acts of terrorism, war (whether or not declared), armed
conflicts or otherwise after the date hereof).

  



  

 **Section 5.2** **.** ** _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary
Action_.** Each of Parent and MergerCo has all requisite corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance

  



  

25      
   



  

by Parent and MergerCo of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
action by the board of directors of Parent and the board of directors of
MergerCo and by the stockholders of MergerCo, and, except as set forth on
_Schedule 5.2_, no other action on the part of Parent or MergerCo is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by Parent or MergerCo of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and MergerCo
and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
the Company, is a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
MergerCo, as the case may be, enforceable against each of them in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general equitable principles.

  



  

 **Section 5.3** **.** ** _No Conflict; Consents_**. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 5.3_, the execution and delivery by Parent and MergerCo of this
Agreement, and the consummation by Parent and MergerCo of the transactions in
accordance with the terms hereof, do not (i) violate, conflict with or result
in a default (whether after the giving of notice, lapse of time or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination of, any contract, agreement,
permit, license, authorization or obligation to which Parent or MergerCo is a
party or by which its assets are bound, or any provision of
the organizational documents of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii)
violate or result in a violation of, or constitute a default (whether after
the giving of notice, lapse of time or both) under, any provision of any law,
regulation or rule, or any order of, or any restriction imposed by, any court
or other governmental agency applicable to Parent or MergerCo or (iii)
require from Parent or MergerCo any notice to, declaration or filing with, or
consent or approval of any Governmental Authority or other third party,
except, in each case, where such violation, conflict, default, termination or
failure to provide notice or to obtain consent or approval, as applicable,
would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 **Section 5.4** **.** ** _Required Financing_.** Parent and MergerCo have
obtained financing (the " _Acquisition Financing_ ") commitment letters,
attached hereto as _Schedule 5.4_ (the " _Commitment Letters_ "), ** __**
which, together with equity arrangements pursuant to the equity commitment
letter attached hereto as _Schedule 5.4_, are sufficient to fund
the Exchange Fund on the terms and conditions contemplated by this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger, and has sufficient funds to perform its
obligations and the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under Article II
of this Agreement (assuming such financing arrangements are funded in full).
The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and have not been
rescinded or amended in a manner which would materially impair the ability of
Parent or MergerCo to perform their obligations hereunder.

  



  

 **Section 5.5** **.** ** _Brokers_**. No broker, finder or investment banker
is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission from the
Company in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of Parent, MergerCo or any of Parents other Subsidiaries.

  



  

 **Section 5.6** **.** ** _Litigation_**. There is no suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the senior
management of Parent, threatened against Parent or

  



  

26      
   



  

MergerCo and neither Parent nor MergerCo is subject to any outstanding order,
writ, judgment, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority that, in
either case, would be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to
(a) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or (b)
otherwise prevent or materially delay performance by Parent or MergerCo of
any of their material obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 5.7** **.** ** _Inspection; No Other Representations_.** Each of
Parent and MergerCo is an informed and sophisticated entity, and has engaged
advisors experienced in the evaluation and acquisition of companies such as
the Company and its Subsidiaries as contemplated hereunder.  Each of Parent
and MergerCo has undertaken such investigation and has been provided with and
has evaluated such documents and information as it has deemed necessary to
enable it to make an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.  Parent and MergerCo have received all materials
relating to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries that they have
requested and have been afforded the opportunity to obtain any additional
information necessary to verify the accuracy of any such information or of
any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder or to
otherwise evaluate the merits of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
of Parent and MergerCo acknowledges that the Company has given such person
complete and open access to the key employees, documents and facilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company and its representatives have
answered to Parents and MergerCos satisfaction all inquiries that Parent,
MergerCo or their representatives have made concerning the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and MergerCo acknowledges that the Company does not
make any representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections,
estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to Parent or MergerCo of
future revenues, future results of operations (or any component thereof),

Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) any other information or documents made
available to Parent or MergerCo or their counsel, accountants or advisors
with respect to the Company its Subsidiaries or any of their respective

 **Section 7.6** **.** ** _No Solicitations_**.

  



  

(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries or any
of the directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives or agents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Representatives_
") to, directly or indirectly, (i) discuss, negotiate, undertake,
authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, either as the proposed
surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired corporation, any transaction
involving a merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase or
disposition of any amount of the assets of the Company (other than the sale
of inventory in the ordinary course of business) or any of its Subsidiaries
or any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations
or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition
Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any person or entity,
any information concerning the business, operations, properties or assets of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition
Transaction, or (iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other
person or entity to do or seek any of the foregoing.

  



  

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any persons or entities (other than Parent
and MergerCo) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. The
Company agrees not to (and to cause its Subsidiaries not to) release any
third party from the confidentiality provisions of any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

  



  

 **Section 7.7.** ** _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_**.

  



  

(a) Parent and MergerCo agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary
and agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided for in the respective
charters or by-laws or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any claims (each a " _Claim_ ") asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Claim. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in any written
indemnification agreements between the Company and/or one or more of its
Subsidiaries and such officers and directors and listed in _Schedule
7.7(a)_.

  



  

33      
   



  

(b) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors and
officers in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company that shall provide
such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms
not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company,
so long as the aggregate cost is not more than 250% of the annual premiums
paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. In
the event that the cost for such coverage exceeds 250% of the annual premiums
paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation may enter into any agreement to spend up to that
amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such
policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

  



  

(c) The obligations under this Section 7.7 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 7.7 applies without the consent of such Indemnified Party
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section
7.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.7 and shall
be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

  



  

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

  



  

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Parent and MergerCo the resignations of such persons as Parent or
MergerCo shall request from their positions as officers or directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

 **Section 7.8** **.** ** _Employee Benefit Arrangements_**.

  



  

(a) Parent and MergerCo shall ensure that, except as set forth in _Schedule
7.8(a)_, all persons who were employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately preceding the Closing Date, including those on vacation, leave of
absence or disability (the " _Company Employees_ "), will remain employed in
a comparable position on and immediately after the Closing Date, at not less
than the same base rate of pay. Neither Parent nor MergerCo shall, at any
time prior to 180 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "mass layoff" as
that term is defined in WARN, or comparable conduct under any applicable
state law, affecting in whole or in part any facility, site of employment,
operating unit or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries without

  



  

34      
   



  

complying fully with the requirements of WARN or such applicable state law.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any
Company Employee any right to continued employment with the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, MergerCo, the Company or any Subsidiary
following the Closing Date, nor shall anything herein interfere with the
right of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, MergerCo, the Company or any
Subsidiary to terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time,
with or without cause.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and MergerCo acknowledges that consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a change in
control of the Company (to the extent such concept is applicable) for
purposes of the Company Plans. From and after the Closing, as applicable,
(i) Parent, MergerCo and the Company will honor in accordance with their
terms all cash bonus plans, stock option and stock incentive
plans, employment agreements, consulting agreements, change-of-control
agreements and severance agreements or plans listed in _Schedule 7.8(b)_
between the Company and its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or
employee of the Company or such Subsidiary in effect prior to the Closing
Date, including without limitation the Companys Sale and Employee Retention
Program attached to _Schedule 7.8(b) _and (ii) the Company will honor the
severance obligations, when and if triggered, set forth in _Schedule
7.8(b)_.

  



  

(c) For a period of six (6) months following the Effective Time (the "
_Transition Period_ "), Parent shall cause, and cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide the Company Employees with employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements (other than non-qualified deferred compensation
plans and stock option, restricted stock and other equity-based plans) which
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements (other than non-qualified deferred
compensation plans and stock option, restricted stock and other equity-based
plans) maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause
the applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of Company Employees with
the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company attributable to any period
before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other
appropriate benefits, including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum
waiting periods for participation, but excluding benefit accruals under any
pension plan (whether or not qualified).  Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, treat any
Company Employee as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any
health or similar plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation for a pre-
existing medical condition, and any deductibles and co-pays paid under any of
the Companys or any of the Subsidiaries health plans attributable to the
calendar year in which the closing occurs shall be credited towards
deductibles and co-pays under the health plans of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for such calendar year. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, to make appropriate arrangements with its
insurance carrier(s) to ensure such results.

  



  

(d) After the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor
all obligations that accrued prior to the Effective Time, and determinations
or

  



  

35      
   



  

commitments that were made prior to the Effective Time, and which are set
forth on _Schedule 7.8(d)_, by the Company or the Companys compensation
committee with regard to the Companys management incentive plan for the 2004
fiscal year, in each case under the Companys deferred compensation plans,
management incentive plans and long range incentive plans in effect as of the
date hereof and which are listed on _Schedule 7.8(d)_. Except as is
otherwise required by the existing terms of the written employment
and severance agreements to which the Company is presently a party and that
are listed in _Schedule 7.8(d)_, future accruals may be (but are
not required to be) provided for under any such plan(s) or under any
similar plan(s) of the Surviving Corporation or Parent.

  



  

 **Section 7.9** **.** ** _Conveyance Taxes; Costs_.** Parent shall
be liable for and shall hold the Company harmless against any transfer,
value added, excise, stock transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any
similar taxes that become payable in connection with the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby, and the applicable parties shall file such
applications and documents as shall permit any such tax to be assessed and
paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with any available pre-
sale filing procedure, and as shall permit any refund of any such tax before
or after the Closing Date.

  



  

 **Section 7.10** **.** ** _Books and Records; Insurance_.** Parent and
MergerCo shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary
to, until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books,
records and other documents pertaining to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in existence on the Closing Date and to make the same available
for inspection and copying by the stockholders of the Company as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time or any of the representatives of
such stockholders at the expense of such stockholders during the normal
business hours of Parent, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable
notice. No such books, records or documents shall be destroyed after the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date by Parent, MergerCo or the Surviving
Corporation, without first providing written notice to the Major
Stockholders, and giving such persons, at their option and expense, on behalf
of the stockholders of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, thirty (30) days from the date of such notice to take possession of
such books, records or documents. If possession is not taken by such persons
after such thirty (30) day period, Parent, MergerCo or the Surviving
Corporation may destroy such books, records and documents.

  



  

 **Section 7.11** **.** ** _Further Action_.** Each of the parties hereto
shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take or cause
to be taken all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all
things necessary, proper or advisable and execute and deliver such documents
and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date
of all of the conditions to their respective obligations, including, but not
limited to, the Companys obligation to obtain all applicable third party
consents, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 7.12** **.** ** _Actions with Respect to Financing_**.

  



  

(a) Parent and MergerCo will perform all obligations required to be performed
by them in accordance with and pursuant to the Commitment Letters for the

  



  

36      
   



  

Acquisition Financing in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, will use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the same in full
force and effect, and will not amend, terminate or waive any provisions under
such Commitment Letters in a manner that would materially affect the Parents
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of the Company. Parent will from time to time provide such
information as the Company may reasonably request regarding the status of
such Acquisition Financing and related negotiations. The Company agrees to
comply with any reasonable request made by Parent for the Company to provide
information or take any action in connection with the Acquisition Financing.

  



  

(b) Parent will provide prompt written notice to the Company following its
receipt of notification by any financing source under the Commitment Letters
or in connection with any substitute debt or other financing of such sources
refusal or intended refusal to provide the financing described in the
applicable Commitment Letters and, in each case, the stated reasons therefor
(if any). In any such event, the Parent will use reasonable commercial
efforts to arrange substitute financing for such financing as promptly as
practicable.

  



  

 **Section 7.13** **.** ** _Advice of Changes_**. The Company and Parent
shall promptly advise the other party in writing of (i) any written notice
from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) any written notice from any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or regarding any
violation, or alleged violation of law, (iii) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any fact or event which would reasonably likely (A) cause any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or
any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect or (B) to cause any covenant, condition
or agreement hereunder to not to be complied with or satisfied in all
material respects, (iv) the failure of it to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement, or (v) any
Customer Change Event.  To the extent any event occurs or situation arises
which results or is reasonably likely to result in a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by any party under this Agreement, such
party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach prior
to the Closing Date.

 _further_  that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section

(d) by Parent or MergerCo, if neither Parent nor MergerCo is then in material
breach of any term of this Agreement, upon written notice to Company, upon

the information obtained by Parent and MergerCo pursuant to the Phase I
reviews conducted at the direction of Parent and MergerCo with respect to the

parties hereto by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto at any time before or after any approval hereof by the

unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this

 **Section 10.11** **.** ** _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_.**  All
disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard
to its rules of conflict of laws. Each of the Company, Parent and MergerCo
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the "
_Chosen Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Chosen Courts and agrees
not to plead or claim in any Chosen Court that such litigation brought
therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties
hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject
to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an
agent in the State of Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal
process and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by
prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the
United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service
made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect
as if served upon

  



  

48      
   



  

such party personally within the State of Delaware. For purposes of
implementing the parties agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for
service of process in the State of Delaware, each of Parent and MergerCo does
hereby appoint The Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209

Delaware 19801, as such agent.

  



  

 **Section 10.12** **.** ** _Specific Performance_.** The parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the Chosen Courts, including without limitation the
obligation to close the Merger on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 1.4
hereof.  Such remedies shall not be exclusive and shall be in addition to
any other remedies that any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

  



  

 **Section 10.13** **.** ** _Mutual Drafting_.** The parties hereto are
sophisticated and have been represented by attorneys throughout
the transactions contemplated hereby who have carefully negotiated the
provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties do not intend that the
presumptions of laws or rules relating to the interpretation of contracts
against the drafter of any particular clause should be applied to this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith, and
therefore waive their effects.

  



  

 **Section 10.14** **.** ** _Miscellaneous_.** This Agreement (a)
constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Schedules
and Exhibits attached hereto, the entire agreement and supersedes all of the
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefits of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns and is not intended to confer upon any
other person (except as set forth below) any rights or remedies hereunder and
(c) may be executed in two or more counterparts which together shall
constitute a single agreement.
