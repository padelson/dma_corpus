Upon completion of the Resource Report (as defined in Section 7.5(a) below),

The Vendors' Representative and its authorized representatives and agents
shall have a period of twenty (20) business days (the "Review Period") from
the date they receive the Resource Notice to review the same and the Resource
Report with a view to assessing (a) the correctness of the calculations of the
Resource Payment based on the Mineral Resources, and (b) that the Resource
Report is compliant with NI 43-101 and the professional standards of the
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. For the purpose of
such review, Purchaser agrees to provide (and cause any of Purchaser's
representatives to provide) the Vendors' Representative and its authorized
representatives and agents all working papers, schedules and other
documentation used or prepared by Purchaser or its representatives and agents
in the preparation of the Resource Report, as applicable. If no objection to
the Resource Notice is delivered, in writing, to Purchaser by the Vendors'
Representative within the Review Period, the calculation of the Resource
Payment reflected in the Resource Notice shall be deemed to have been approved
as of the last day of the Review Period.

    | (c) |  

If the Vendors' Representative objects to the Resource Payment calculation as

Period, then it shall give to Purchaser a notice in writing (the "Objection
Notice"), setting out in reasonable detail the nature of such objection and
the amount by which the Resource Payment would be changed if the objections of

Representative and Purchaser shall request the Independent Technical
Consultant to determine the matter in dispute, and the decision of the
Independent Technical Consultant shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
the parties and there shall be no appeal from the Independent Technical
Consultant's determination. The fees and expenses of the Independent Technical
Consultant shall be borne equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Vendors' Representative on behalf of the Participating Shareholders, on the
other hand.

Withholding Taxes

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Subject to Section 4.6, Purchaser, the Depositary and JDS Silver shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable to any person under this Agreement such amounts as Purchaser, JDS
Silver or the Depositary may be required to deduct and withhold therefrom
under any provision of applicable Laws in respect of Taxes. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. The right of
Purchaser, the Depositary and JDS Silver to withhold Tax shall not derogate or
limit any gross-up obligations that may otherwise apply to any amounts so
paid. In the event that the Depositary or JDS Silver remits, or Purchaser
remits in respect of any taxable year or period, or portion thereof, ending
on, before or because of the Closing, an amount pursuant to this Section 4.5,
as soon as practicable thereafter the Depositary or JDS Silver, as applicable,
shall deliver to Purchaser, or Purchaser shall deliver to the Vendors'
Representative, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by the Governmental Entity to which such amount was remitted
evidencing such remittance, a copy of the Return reporting such remittance or
other evidence of such remittance reasonable satisfactory to Purchaser or the
Vendors' Representative, as the case may be.

(a)

  


 

  

    | (i) |  

Each JDS Silver Shareholder that is not a resident of Canada for purposes of
the Tax Act may deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser on or before the
date on which the payment of the Participating Shareholder Upfront Purchase
Price, the Mines Act Permit Payment, the Resource Payment, or the Escrow
Amount as applicable, is paid (each, a "Payment Date") a certificate issued by
the Canadian Minister of National Revenue under section 116 of the Tax Act (a
"116 Certificate") in respect of the transfer of its JDS Silver Shares to
Purchaser (the "116 Shares").

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (ii) |  

If a 116 Certificate contemplated under Section 4.6(a)(i) is so delivered to
Purchaser in respect of a JDS Silver Shareholder, Purchaser shall be entitled
to withhold from the portion of the Participating Shareholder Upfront Purchase
Price, the Mines Act Permit Payment, or the Resource Payment, as applicable,
payable to that JDS Silver Shareholder on the relevant Payment Date (the "116
Share Consideration") twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount, if any, by
which such 116 Share Consideration exceeds the certificate limit fixed by the
Minister of National Revenue in such certificate. All such withholdings shall,
to the extent possible, be made from the cash portion of such 116 Share
Consideration.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (iii) |  

If a 116 Certificate contemplated under Section 4.6(a)(i) is not so delivered,
Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold from the cash portions of the 116
Share Consideration payable to that JDS Silver Shareholder on that particular
Payment Date twenty-five percent (25%) of such 116 Share Consideration;
provided however, that any Qualifying JDS Silver Shareholder may execute and
deliver a 116 Agreement and receive on the relevant Payment Date its
applicable portion of the Participating Shareholder Upfront Purchase Price or
the Mines Act Permit Payment (as applicable), without deduction for
withholding as set out in this Section 4.6(a)(iii).

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

24  

  


 

  

    | (iv) |  

Any amounts withheld by Purchaser from the 116 Share Consideration under
Section 4.6(a)(i) or (iii) shall be paid by Purchaser to the Escrow Agent, on
the condition that such amounts shall be held by the Escrow Agent in trust for
the benefit of the JDS Silver Shareholder in respect of which such amounts are
withheld and Purchaser for payment to such JDS Silver Shareholder and the
Receiver General for Canada, as described in this Section 4.6.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

Where Purchaser has withheld any amounts under Section 4.6(a) and the JDS
Silver Shareholder in respect of which such amounts were withheld delivers to
Purchaser, after the Payment Date on which such amounts were withheld and on
or prior to the second-to-last business day of the month following the month
in which such Payment Date occurs, a 116 Certificate, subject to Section
4.6(e), the Escrow Agent shall pay forthwith to the Receiver General for
Canada, for the account of the JDS Silver Shareholder in accordance with
section 116 of the Tax Act, twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount, if any,
by which such 116 Share Consideration exceeds the certificate limit fixed in
such certificate and pay forthwith to the JDS Silver Shareholder any remaining
amount that Purchaser has withheld and paid to the Escrow Agent in respect of
such 116 Shares (together with any interest earned on such withheld amounts).

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (c) |  

Where Purchaser has withheld any amounts under Section 4.6(a) and the JDS
Silver Shareholder in respect of which such amounts were withheld does not
deliver to Purchaser, on or prior to the second-to-last business day of the
month following the month in which the Payment Date occurs, a 116 Certificate,
subject to Section 4.6(e), the Escrow Agent shall pay forthwith to the
Receiver General for Canada, for the account of the JDS Silver Shareholder in
accordance with section 116 of the Tax Act, the amount Purchaser has withheld
and paid to the Escrow Agent in respect of such JDS Silver Shareholder and pay
forthwith to such JDS Silver Shareholder any interest earned on such withheld
amounts.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (d) |  

For greater certainty, Purchaser shall not remit any amount referred to in
Section 4.6(b) or 4.6(c) before the second-to-last business day of the month
following the month in which the Payment Date occurs.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (e) |  

Notwithstanding Section 4.6(b) and 4.6(c), where Purchaser has withheld any
amount under Section 4.6(a) in respect of a particular JDS Silver Shareholder
and either a 116 Certificate with a certificate limit below the 116 Share
Consideration in respect of which such 116 Certificate was obtained is
delivered to Purchaser as contemplated under Section 4.6(b) or no 116
Certificate has been delivered to Purchaser as contemplated under 4.6(c), no
amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the Receiver General for Canada if
such JDS Silver Shareholder delivers to Purchaser, on or before the second-to-
last business day of the month following the month in which the Payment Date
occurs, a comfort letter or other evidence satisfactory to Purchaser (acting
reasonably) issued by the Canada Revenue Agency extending the time period
within which Purchaser need remit an amount in respect of 116 Share
Consideration for the account of such JDS Silver Shareholder (a "Comfort
Letter"), in which case the funds held by the Escrow Agent in respect of such
116 Share Consideration shall continue to be held in trust and the provisions
of this Section 4.6 shall continue to apply as if the reference to the second-
to-last business day after the end of the month in which the Payment Date
occurs were instead a reference to the new date set by the Canada Revenue
Agency as the date for the remittance of the particular withheld amounts.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

25  

  


 

  

    | (f) |  

In the event that the Canada Revenue Agency revokes a Comfort Letter described
in Section 4.6(e) above, or otherwise indicates that such Comfort Letter is no
longer effective, the particular JDS Silver Shareholder shall notify Purchaser
and the Escrow Agent forthwith and, upon such notification, the Escrow Agent
shall remit the withheld amount in respect of such JDS Silver Shareholder to
the Receiver General for Canada and shall pay forthwith to such JDS Silver
Shareholder any interest earned on such remitted withheld amount.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (g) |  

Any amounts withheld by Purchaser under Section 4.6(a) shall be credited to
Purchaser as a payment to the JDS Silver Shareholder on account of the 116
Share Consideration.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (h) |  

Any amounts withheld by Purchaser under Section 4.6(a) and held by the Escrow
Agent shall be invested in an interest bearing account, with any such interest
to accrue for the benefit of the JDS Silver Shareholder on account of which
such funds were withheld.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (i) |

 _Reports_. Since December 31, 2015, Guarantor has filed all documents in the
Guarantor Public Disclosure Record required to be filed by it in accordance
with applicable Securities Laws with the Securities Authorities except where
such non-compliance has not and would not reasonably be expected to have a
materially adverse effect on the trading price of Coeur Shares. The documents
comprising the Guarantor Public Disclosure Record (i) did not, as of their
respective dates or dates of amendment, if applicable, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, and (ii) complied in
all material respects with applicable Securities Laws at the time they were
filed or furnished. Except where the failure to timely file has not had or
would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the
trading price of Coeur Shares, Guarantor has timely filed or furnished or
caused to be filed or furnished with the Securities Authorities all
amendments, forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required
to be filed or furnished by Guarantor with the Securities Authorities since

normal period-end adjustments and they may omit notes that are not required by
applicable Laws and GAAP in the unaudited statements) and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and for the periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of any
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, to normal period-end
adjustments) and reflect reserves required by GAAP in respect of all material
contingent liabilities, if any, of Guarantor and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis. There has been no material change in Guarantor's
accounting policies, except as described in the notes to the Guarantor
Financial Statements, since December 31, 2016.

    | (p) |  

 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since June 30, 2017, except as disclosed in the
Guarantor Public Disclosure Record, there has not occurred any fact,
development, circumstance, change, matter, action, condition, event or
occurrence that required the filing of a material change report under
applicable Securities Laws. Guarantor and its subsidiaries have no liability
or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) which is material to Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, including any agreement, Contract or commitment to create, assume or
issue any bond, debenture, note or other similar instrument or any agreement,
Contract or commitment providing for the guarantee, indemnification,
assumption or endorsement or any similar commitment with respect to the
obligations, liabilities (contingent or otherwise) or indebtedness of any
other person, required by GAAP to be set forth in a consolidated balance sheet
of Guarantor and its subsidiaries or in the notes thereto, which individually
or in the aggregate has not been reflected in the Guarantor Financial
Statements, other than liabilities, indebtedness or obligations incurred by
Guarantor and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business since June
30, 2017.

   
---|---|---

 _Litigation Matters_. Except as disclosed in the Guarantor Public Disclosure
Record, there are no material claims, actions, suits, grievances, complaints
or proceedings pending, or to the knowledge of Guarantor, threatened affecting
Guarantor or its subsidiaries or affecting their respective property or assets
or the business of Guarantor, taken as a whole, at law or in equity before or
by any Governmental Entity, including matters arising under Environmental Laws
that have had or are reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on
the trading price of the Coeur Shares or that would prevent or materially
delay consummation of the Transaction, nor to the knowledge of Guarantor, are
there any events or circumstances which could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation (provided that the
representation in this section shall not apply to claims, actions, proceedings
or investigations which may arise after the date of this Agreement which do
not have a reasonable prospect of succeeding or, if successful, would not
have, nor reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the
trading price of the Coeur Shares) or which would prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Transaction.

    | (r) |  

 _Disclosure Controls_. Guarantor has designed and implemented a system of
disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by Guarantor in its annual filings,
interim filings or other reports filed or submitted by it under applicable
Securities Laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in applicable Securities Laws. Such disclosure controls
and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Guarantor in its annual filings,
interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under applicable
Securities Laws is accumulated and communicated to Guarantor's management to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (s) |  

 _Internal Controls_. Guarantor has designed and implemented a system of
internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and
includes policies and procedures that (i) relate to the maintenance of records
that accurately and fairly reflect the material transactions, acquisitions and
dispositions of the property and assets of Guarantor and each of its
subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Guarantor and its subsidiaries are
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
Guarantor and its subsidiaries; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the property or assets of Guarantor or any of its
subsidiaries that could have a material effect on Guarantor's financial
statements. To the knowledge of Guarantor, as of the date of this Agreement:
(A) there are no material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
internal controls over financial reporting of Guarantor that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the ability of Guarantor to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (B) there is and has been
since December 31, 2012, no fraud, whether or not material, involving
management or any other employees who have a significant role in the internal
control over financial reporting of Guarantor. Since December 31, 2012,
neither Guarantor nor any of its subsidiaries, nor any of its or their
representatives, have received any (x) complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim in writing from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters or (y) expression of concern from employees of
Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters.

material Mineral Rights (collectively, the "Guarantor Mineral Rights"), in
each case free and clear of any material Liens (other than as set out in the

    | (ii) |  

Guarantor and its subsidiaries hold such rights title and interests in and to
the Guarantor Properties and Guarantor Mineral Rights under valid, subsisting

currently conducted or anticipated to be conducted except those Mineral Rights
as are anticipated to be obtained in the ordinary course and consistent with

sound mining engineering geoscience and other applicable industry standards
and practices including the Standards and Guidelines established by the

policies for substantially similar premiums are in full force and effect;

a term exceeding 12 months.

Mutual Covenants

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated in this
Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier

---|---|---

    | (a) |

(1) time during any calendar quarter. The Vendors' Representative (or the
Independent Technical Consultant) shall diligently complete any audit or other
examination permitted hereunder.

   7.6 |  

Tax Matters

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (a) |  

After Closing, Purchaser shall, on behalf of JDS Silver and each of its
subsidiaries, duly and timely make, prepare and file all Returns required to
be so made, prepared and filed by JDS Silver or any of its subsidiaries for
any period which ends on, before or because of the Closing and for which
Returns have not been filed as of such date (all such Tax Returns referred to
as the "Stub Period Returns"). Purchaser shall prepare each such Stub Period
Return on a basis consistent with (i) applicable Law, and (ii) the past
practices and procedures of JDS Silver and each of its subsidiaries, as
applicable.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

Purchaser and the Vendors' Representative shall cooperate fully with each
other and make available to each other in a timely fashion such data and other
information as may reasonably be required for the preparation of any Stub
Period Return of JDS Silver or any of its subsidiaries and shall preserve such
data and other information until the expiration of any applicable limitation
period under any applicable Tax Laws. In addition, Purchaser shall arrange for
such Stub Period Returns to be signed by a duly authorized representative of
JDS Silver or such subsidiary, as applicable, on or before the date on which
such Stub Period Returns are required by Law to be filed with the relevant
Governmental Entity.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (c) |  

Stub Period Returns required to be prepared by Purchaser shall be submitted by
Purchaser in draft form to the Vendors' Representative no later than 90 days
after the Closing. The Vendors' Representative shall have the right to ask
Purchaser for reasonable changes to be made to any such Return by
communicating such changes in writing to Purchaser no later than 60 days after
the delivery to the Vendors' Representative of such draft Stub Period Returns.
Purchaser shall make, or cause to be made, such reasonable changes required by
the Vendors' Representative to such Stub Period Returns and file such Stub
Period Returns on or before the date on which it is required by Law to be
filed with the relevant Governmental Entity.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

47  

  


 

  

    | (d) |  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties agree and
acknowledge that Purchaser shall, in its sole discretion, be entitled to cause
JDS Silver or any of its subsidiaries, as applicable, to make an election
pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act in respect of the taxation year
of JDS Silver or such subsidiary, as applicable, ending on or because of the
Closing.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (e) |  

Any refunds or credits of Taxes (including any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto net of any Taxes paid or payable by JDS Silver or any of its
subsidiaries, as the case may be, on such interest) of, or with respect to,
JDS Silver and each of its subsidiaries for any taxation period ending on or
prior to the Effective Date or in which the Effective Date occurs (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any such Taxes paid that are being disputed) will
be for the account of the JDS Silver Shareholders (except to the extent such
refunds or credits are specifically taken into account in computing the
Aggregate Consideration). Purchaser and JDS Silver or any of its subsidiaries,
as the case may be, shall promptly inform the Vendors' Representative of any
such refunds or credits to which the JDS Silver Shareholders may be entitled
hereunder upon receiving written confirmation or notification from the
applicable Governmental Entity of any such refunds or credits. Purchaser shall
pay over, as additional purchase price, an amount equal to the amount of any
such refunds or credits to the Vendors' Representative, net of any applicable
withholding Taxes, within 15 calendar days following the date such refunds or
credits were paid or credited by the relevant tax authority to JDS Silver or
any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be. The provisions of Section 4.6
shall apply to any payment made pursuant to this Section 7.6(e) as though such
payment formed part of the Aggregate Consideration.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (f) |  

Except as required by applicable Law, each of Purchaser, JDS Silver and any of
its subsidiaries shall not, without prior written consent of the Vendors'
Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld, refile, amend or otherwise
modify any Tax Return filed for any taxation period ending on, before or
because of the Closing.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (g) |  

Purchaser will provide notice to the Vendors' Representative of any inquiries
made by, discussions with or representations or submissions proposed to be
made to any Governmental Entity to the extent that the subject matter thereof
relates to representations, covenants or obligations of the JDS Silver
Shareholders hereunder or could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnity
hereunder within 15 days of becoming aware of such inquiries, discussions or
matters. Purchaser will forthwith advise the Vendors' Representative of the
substance of any such inquiries or discussions and provide the Vendors'
Representative with copies of any written communications from any Governmental
Entity relating to such inquiries or discussions in each case within 15 days
of obtaining such information or having such discussions or receiving such
written communications. Purchaser will provide the Vendors' Representative a
reasonable opportunity to comment on any such representations or submissions
and to attend any meeting with any such Governmental Entity with respect to
such matters.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (h) |  

During such periods of time as JDS Silver and each of its Subsidiaries are
required by any Law or Governmental Entity to maintain books and records, the
Vendors' Representative shall have reasonable access to, and the right to copy
for bona fide business purposes relating to Taxes and during reasonable
business hours, upon reasonable prior notice, all relevant books and records
of JDS Silver or any of its subsidiaries. Purchaser and the Vendors'
Representative will use reasonable commercial efforts to retain and preserve
all such books and records for such periods and will not cause or acquiesce in
the destruction or disposal of such books and records without first offering
them to the Vendors' Representative.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (i) |  

Purchaser will provide the reasonable assistance of the employees or personnel
of Purchaser, JDS Silver or any of its subsidiaries and the accounting and
legal and other representatives and advisors of Purchaser, JDS Silver or any
of its subsidiaries and otherwise take such reasonable steps to cooperate with
the Vendors' Representative and render all reasonable assistance, as the
Vendors' Representative may reasonably request (including, to the extent
requested by the Vendors' Representative, dealing directly with any
Governmental Entity in relation to audits, inquiries, discussions or
disputes), with respect to all matters relating to any inquires, discussions
or disputes where the subject matter thereof relates to representations,
covenants or obligations of the JDS Silver Shareholders hereunder or could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnity hereunder.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

48  

  


 

  

    | (j) |  

Purchaser covenants that it will not, or cause or permit JDS Silver or any of
its subsidiaries to, without prior written consent of the Vendors'
Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld, take any action on or after
the Closing, make any election or deemed election or make or change any Tax
election, amend any Return, file any waiver in respect of any Return or
limitation period relating to Taxes, or take any position on any Return that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnity hereunder
(except to the extent that such right of indemnity relates to a loss in
respect of which the Vendors' Representative has failed to take all reasonable
actions to defend or mitigate), and Purchaser agrees that that the JDS Silver
Shareholders are to have no liability for any Tax resulting from any such
action, unless, in either case, Purchaser acting reasonably and in good faith
has a belief that such past Tax filing is contrary to Law; provided, however,
that before taking such an action with respect to a past Tax filing, Purchaser
will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Vendors'
Representative with 15 days prior written notice and will consider in good
faith any written communication sent to Purchaser regarding the accuracy and
legitimacy of the past Tax filing.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (k) |  

In connection with any request for information, assistance or cooperation by
the Vendors' Representative pursuant to this Section 7.6, the Vendors'
Representative shall reimburse Purchaser for all documented, out-of-pocket
fees or expenses incurred by Purchaser; provided, for greater certainty, that
no reimbursement will apply to any copying charges, overhead or compensation
relating to Purchaser's directors, officers, employees or contractors.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (l) |  

To the extent there is a conflict between the provisions in Section 4.8 and
Section 7.6, the provisions in Section 4.8 will control.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   7.7 |  

Amending Agreements

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (a) |  

JDS Silver and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate an amendment to the Maverix Royalty Agreement, which amendment is
intended to afford Maverix equivalent economic protections but remove
Maverix's consent to sale agreements in Section 9(d) of the Maverix Royalty
Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

JDS Silver and Purchaser shall work in good faith to review and consider the
equipment leases and rental arrangements under the Equipment Rental Agreement
dated December 1, 2015 between JDS Subsidiary and JDS Energy and Mining Inc., as
amended from time to time, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate amendments and terminations in respect of certain equipment as
identified to be appropriate by Purchaser in such review process.

subsidiaries) shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors
and assigns (each a "Purchaser Indemnified Party"), harmless from and against
any losses which may be made or brought against any Purchaser Indemnified
Party or which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may suffer or incur, directly
or indirectly, in respect of, as a result of, or arising out of:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (i) |  

any non-fulfillment of any covenant on the part of JDS Silver, the Vendors'

this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Effective Date;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (iii) |  

any Taxes payable by JDS Silver or any of its subsidiaries (and in each case
any successor thereto) in respect of any taxable year or period, or portion
thereof, ending on, before or because of the Closing, except as otherwise
accounted for as part of the purchase hereunder; or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (iv) |  

any claim in respect of the matter set out on Schedule 9.4(a)(iv) of the

Purchaser shall indemnify and hold JDS Silver, the Vendors' Representative and
the Participating Shareholders and each of their affiliates, shareholders,
members, limited partners, direct and indirect equity investors, officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each, a "JDS
Indemnified Party", and together with a Purchaser Indemnified Party, each an
"Indemnified Party"), harmless from and against any losses which may be made
or brought against any JDS Indemnified Party or which any JDS Indemnified
Party may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, in respect of, as a result
of, or arising out of:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (i) |  

any non-fulfillment of any covenant on the part of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement or any document or certificate given pursuant to this Agreement;

   9.5 |  

Minimum and Maximum Indemnification Claim; Recovery Matters

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (a) |  

The obligations of Purchaser and the Participating Shareholders in respect of
the matters described in Section 9.4 shall become applicable only when the
losses actually incurred by the person entitled to indemnification in the
aggregate exceed $1,000,000 (the "Basket"). Once the Basket has been exceeded,
the obligations of indemnification with respect to such matters shall apply to
any and all losses from the first dollar. For certainty, the foregoing
limitations shall not apply to any failure of Purchaser to pay any amounts
payable by Purchaser to the Participating Shareholders under Article 4.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

In no circumstances shall the maximum aggregate liability of a Participating
Shareholder to Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of the indemnities
herein provided exceed:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (i) |  

for any breach of a Fundamental Representation in respect of such
Participating Shareholder, such Participating Shareholders' Pro Rata Portion
of the Aggregate Consideration delivered by Purchaser to the Participating
Shareholders at the time of such indemnity claim (including, for greater
certainty, amounts delivered in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement), and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (ii) |  

for any breach (other than a Fundamental Representation in respect of such
Participating Shareholder) or other liability or obligations arising
hereunder, the value equal to fifteen percent (15%) of such Participating
Shareholders' Pro Rata Portion of the Upfront Purchase Price delivered by
Purchaser to the Participating Shareholders at the time of such indemnity
claim (including, for greater certainty, amounts delivered in escrow pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement).

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (c) |  

In no circumstances shall the maximum aggregate liability of Purchaser to the
JDS Indemnified Parties as a result of indemnification under Section
9.4(b)(ii) exceed an amount equal to:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (i) |  

as to the representations and warranties contained in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(b)
and 6.1(c), the Aggregate Consideration, and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (ii) |  

as to the representations and warranties of the Purchaser (other than those
contained in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(b) and 6.1(c)), fifteen percent (15%) of the
Upfront Purchase Price.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (d) |  

If a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or other
recovery in accordance with the provisions of this Article 9, subject to
Section 9.5(e), recovery shall occur first from the Escrow Guarantees and the
Escrow Amount held in escrow under the Escrow Agreement until such time as
such amounts are, in respect of the Pro Rata Portion of the Participating
Shareholder that is an Indemnifying Party, entirely satisfied or depleted; and
thereafter, directly against the applicable Participating Shareholder.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (e) |  

Subject to Sections 9.5(a), 9.5(b) and 9.5(c), Purchaser shall be entitled to
set off the amount of any losses subject to indemnification under Section
9.4(a)(ii) for claims made thereunder after the date that is twelve (12)
months from Closing, but prior to the applicable expiry period under Section
9.1, against any other amounts payable by Purchaser to the applicable
Participating Shareholders for the Mines Act Permit Payment or the Resource
Payment (which right of set-off shall apply, for greater certainty, only with
respect to the Pro Rata Portion of such Participating Shareholders).

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

54  

  


 

  

   9.6 |  

Procedure for Indemnification

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (a) |  

Within a reasonable period of time after the incurrence of any losses by any
Indemnified Party and prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period, including any losses by a third person described below, which might
give rise to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the party from which indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") a
certificate (the "Certificate"), which Certificate shall:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (i) |  

state that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued losses or
anticipates that it will incur liability for losses for which such Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (ii) |  

specify in reasonable detail each individual item of loss included in the
amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis
for any anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach
of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related
and the computation of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled hereunder.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the indemnification
of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims specified in any
Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) business days
after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Certificate, deliver to the
Indemnified Party a notice to such effect and the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall, within the thirty (30) business day period beginning
on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such objection, attempt in
good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each of such claims to which the Indemnifying Party shall have so objected. If
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall succeed in reaching
agreement on their respective rights with respect to any of such claims, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and sign a
memorandum setting forth such agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any particular item or items or
amount or amounts, then the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
submit such dispute for arbitration in accordance with Section 12.4. There
shall be no restriction on such arbitrator as to the award of costs related to
the arbitration being payable by the losing party.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (c) |  

claims for losses specified in any Certificate to which an Indemnifying Party
shall not object in writing within the thirty (30) business day period of
receipt of such Certificate, claims for losses the validity and amount of
which have been the subject of arbitration as described above, or shall have
been settled with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, as described below,
are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "Agreed Claims". Within ten (10)
business days of the determination of the amount of any Agreed Claims, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the
Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank
account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice to the
Indemnifying Party not less than two (2) business days prior to such payment.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   9.7 |  

Third Party Claims

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (a) |  

If a claim by a third person (a "Third Party Claim") is made against any
Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity
with respect thereto under this Section 9.7, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim; provided
that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) business days after receipt of
such notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
of the settlement or defence of such Third Party Claim; _provided that_ :

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

55  

  


 

  

    | (i) |  

the Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in
such settlement or defence through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party,
provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such
Indemnified Party,

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (ii) |  

if the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that (A) a
reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that make it inappropriate for
the same counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, or (B) there are one or more legal defences available to the
Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party, or
available to the Indemnifying Party the assertion of which would be adverse to
the interests of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall permit
the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defence through
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, provided that the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnifying Party.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (iii) |  

the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defence
if: (A) the parties agree, reasonably and in good faith, that such Third Party
Claim would give rise to losses which are more than twice the amount
indemnifiable by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.7; (B) the
Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (C) the Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party; (D) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination
with respect to the action, lawsuit, investigation, proceeding or other claim
giving rise to such claim for indemnification would be detrimental to or
injure the Indemnified Party's reputation or future business prospects; or (E)
upon petition by the Indemnified Party, an arbitrator arbitration in
accordance with Section 12.4 decides that the Indemnifying Party failed or is
failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (c) |  

If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) business days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's notice of a
claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defence thereof,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defence thereof,
but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this
Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (d) |  

Both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, to the extent directly
or indirectly conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim as contemplated
hereby will not enter into, or offer to enter into, any settlement or
compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without the other person's
prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and any judgment, settlement or compromise made without such
approval shall not be determinative of such person's liability to such other
person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay or settle any such claim, provided that in such event it shall
waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party for such claim
unless the Indemnifying Party shall have consented to such payment or
settlement.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (e) |  

The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defence of any Third
Party Claim, including making available records relating to such claim and
furnishing, without expense to the Indemnifying Party and/or its counsel, such
employees of the Indemnified Party as may be reasonably necessary for the
preparation of the defence of any such claim or for testimony as witnesses in
any proceeding relating to such claim.

   9.8 |  

Exclusive Right

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

The rights of indemnification contained in this Article 9 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parties contained in this Agreement or otherwise,
subject to all equitable remedies that are available to the Parties prior to
Closing and each Party waives and, following the Effective Date, releases all
remedies for monetary damages such Party may have in respect of a breach of or
default under this Agreement; provided, however, that for greater certainty,
this Section 9.8 does not prohibit any Party from seeking remedies for
statutory claims it may have and this Section 9.8 shall not be used as an
estoppel therefrom (including in respect of securities Laws). An Indemnified
Party is not entitled to double recovery for any claims even though they may
have resulted from the breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform of more than
one of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of the
Indemnifying Party in this Agreement or be based on different theories of
liability or causes of action. For greater certainty, the covenants and
obligations of this Article 9 shall survive the Closing.

  


 

  

   9.9 |  

Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

All payments (if any) made pursuant to this Article 9 will be treated as
adjustments to the purchase price for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment
will govern for purposes of this Agreement.

  


 

  

ARTICLE 10

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Notice and Cure Provisions

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure
to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time of any event or state of
facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to:

  


 

  

    | (a) |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of any Party contained herein
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the date hereof or at
the Effective Time (provided that this paragraph (a) shall not apply in the
case of any event or state of facts resulting from actions or omissions of a
Party which are permitted or required by this Agreement); or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any Party hereunder prior to the
Effective Time.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Purchaser may not exercise their rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 11.2(a)(iii)(B) and JDS Silver may not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(iv)(B) unless the Party
intending to rely thereon has delivered a written notice to the other Party
specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and
warranties or other matters which the Party delivering such notice is
asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment or the applicable condition or
termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered,
provided that a Party is proceeding diligently to cure such matter and such
matter is capable of being cured, no Party may terminate this Agreement until
the expiration of a period of fifteen (15) business days from such notice, and
then only if such matter has not been cured by such date. If such notice has
been delivered prior to either the making of the application for the Final
Order, such application and such filing shall be postponed until the expiry of
such period. For greater certainty, in the event that such matter is cured
within the time period referred to herein without a Material Adverse Effect,
this Agreement may not be terminated as a result of the cured breach.

limit any gross-up obligations that may otherwise apply to any amounts so
paid.

INVESTMENT OF ESCROW AMOUNT

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Until released in accordance with this Agreement, the Escrow Amount shall be
kept segregated in the records of the Escrow Agent and shall be deposited in
one or more interest-bearing trust accounts to be maintained by the Escrow
Agent in the name of the Escrow Agent at one or more banks listed in Schedule
"C" to this Agreement (each such bank, an "Approved Bank"). The Escrow Agent
shall pay interest at an annual rate which is equal to [●], such annual rate
not to be less than zero. Such payment obligation shall be calculated daily

Agent's benefit or at its risk, as applicable.

  


 

  

All amounts held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be held
by the Escrow Agent for Purchaser and the delivery of the Escrow Amount to the

are at the sole risk of Purchaser and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any
diminution of the Escrow Amount which may result from any deposit made with an
Approved Bank pursuant to this Section 4, including any losses resulting from
a default by the Approved Bank or other credit losses (whether or not
resulting from such a default) and any credit or other losses on any deposit
liquidated or sold prior to maturity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Escrow Agent will have acted prudently in depositing the Escrow
Amount at any Approved Bank, and that the Escrow Agent is not required to make
any further inquiries in respect of any such bank.

  


 

  

At any time and from time to time, Purchaser shall be entitled to direct the
Escrow Agent by written notice (a) not to deposit any new amounts in any
Approved Bank specified in the notice and/or (b) to withdraw all or any of the
Escrow Amount that may then be deposited with any Approved Bank specified in
the notice and re-deposit such amount with one or more of such other Approved
Banks as specified in the notice. With respect to any withdrawal notice, the
Escrow Agent will endeavor to withdraw such amount specified in the notice as
soon as reasonably practicable and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that such
specified amount remains at the sole risk of Purchaser prior to and after such
withdrawal.

    | (i) |  

Purchaser shall give written notice (the "Escrow Claim Notice") to Vendors'

if Vendors' Representative does not deliver written notice to Purchaser and
the Escrow Agent disputing such Escrow Claim (an "Objection Notice") by 4:00

Purchaser delivered an Escrow Claim Notice which has not been otherwise paid,
settled or resolved by the Escrow Period Termination Date provided that it
relates to a bona fide claim. On the Escrow Period Termination Date, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Participating Shareholders (in accordance
with Schedule A their pro rata portion of the Remaining Escrow Amount not

6(a)(iii). Upon release by the Escrow Agent of any Escrow Amount, the Escrow
Agent shall no longer have any further obligations or liabilities in respect
of such Escrow Amount.

determining the accuracy thereof; (v) may employ and consult counsel
satisfactory to it, including in-house counsel for any of the parties hereto,
and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel; and, (vi)
shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from

    | (b) |  

The Escrow Agent may employ such counsel, accountants, engineers, appraisers,
other experts, agents, agencies and advisors as it may reasonably require for
the purpose of discharging its duties under this Agreement, and the Escrow
Agent may act and shall be protected in acting or not acting in good faith on
the opinion or advice or on information obtained from any such parties and
shall not be responsible for any misconduct on the part of any of them. The
reasonable and invoiced costs of such services shall be added to and be part
of the Escrow Agent's fee hereunder.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (c) |  

The Escrow Agent shall retain the right not to act and shall not be held
liable for refusing to act unless it has received clear and reasonable
documentation which complies with the terms of this Agreement. Such
documentation must not require the exercise of any discretion or independent
judgment.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (d) |  

No provision of this Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance
of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights or powers unless
indemnified and funded as provided for herein, other than as a result of its
own gross negligence or bad faith.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (e) |  

The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any act

herewith, except for its own gross negligence or bad faith.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (f) |  

Purchaser shall pay the costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent's services
hereunder, and the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Escrow Agent
in connection with the administration of the escrow created hereby or the
performance or observance of its duties hereunder which are in excess of its
compensation for normal services hereunder and covered by the remuneration,
including without limitation, all out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements
incurred or made by the Escrow Agent in the administration of its services and
duties created hereby (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of its
outside counsel and other outside advisors required for discharge of its
duties hereunder). Any amount owing under this Section and unpaid thirty (30)
days after request for such payment will bear interest from the expiration of
such thirty (30) days at a rate per annum equal to the then current rate
charged by the Escrow Agent, payable on demand.

C-5  

  


 

  

    | (g) |

directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or with the administration of its duties
hereunder, including but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and other
costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any claim of
liability, unless and except to the extent such loss, liability, damage, cost
and expense shall be caused by the Escrow Agent's or its officers',
directors', employees', agents', successors' or assigns' gross negligence or
bad faith. The foregoing indemnification shall survive the release of the
Escrow Amount, the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent or the
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, any liability of the Escrow Agent shall be
limited, in the aggregate, to the amount of annual retainer fees paid by

immediately prior to the Escrow Agent receiving the first notice of the claim.

   11. |  

RESIGNATION OF ESCROW AGENT; SUCCESSOR BY MERGER

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (a) |  

The Escrow Agent may at any time resign as such, subject to this Section 11,
by delivering written notice of resignation to the other parties to this
Agreement and by delivering the Escrow Amount (less any portion thereof
previously distributed in accordance with this Agreement) to any successor
escrow agent designated by both Vendors' Representative and Purchaser, or by a
court of competent jurisdiction, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall be
discharged of and from any and all further obligations arising in connection
with this Agreement. The resignation of the Escrow Agent will take effect on
the earlier to occur of (the "Resignation Date"): (i) the appointment of a
successor escrow agent as aforesaid or by a court of competent jurisdiction;
or (ii) the day which is 30 days after the date of delivery of the Escrow
Agent's written notice of resignation to the other parties hereto. If the
Escrow Agent has not received written notice of the designation of a successor
escrow agent by the Resignation Date, the Escrow Agent's sole responsibility
after such time shall be to retain and safeguard the Escrow Amount until
receipt of written notice of the designation of a successor escrow agent
hereunder or pursuant to a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. If a successor escrow agent has not been appointed within 90
days of the date of the delivery of its written notice of resignation, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Amount (less any portion thereof
previously distributed in accordance with this Agreement) to the legal counsel
designated by both Vendors' Representative and Purchaser and all of the Escrow
Agent's duties and obligations under this Agreement shall thereupon cease
immediately. Vendors' Representative and Purchaser, acting together, shall
have power at any time to remove the existing Escrow Agent and to appoint a
successor escrow agent.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

In the event of the Escrow Agent resigning or being removed as aforesaid or
being dissolved, becoming bankrupt, going into liquidation or otherwise
becoming incapable of acting hereunder, Vendors' Representative and Purchaser
acting together, shall forthwith appoint a successor escrow agent; failing
such appointment by Vendors' Representative and Purchaser, the retiring Escrow
Agent, acting alone, may apply, at the expense of Vendors' Representative and
Purchaser, to a justice of the British Columbia Supreme Court on such notice
as such justice may direct, for the appointment of a successor escrow agent;
but any successor escrow agent so appointed by the Court shall be subject to
removal as aforesaid by Vendors' Representative and Purchaser, acting
together.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

 

C-7  

  


 

  

    | (c) |  

Any successor escrow agent appointed under any provision of this Section 11
shall be a corporation authorized to carry on the business of a trust company
in the Province of British Columbia and, if required by the applicable
legislation for any other jurisdiction, in such other jurisdictions. On any
such appointment, the successor escrow agent shall be vested with the same
powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named
herein as Escrow Agent hereunder. At the request of Vendors' Representative
and Purchaser or the successor escrow agent, the retiring Escrow Agent, upon
payment of the amounts, if any, due to it pursuant to this Agreement,
including any amounts owing to it in respect to outstanding fees,
disbursements and interest thereon, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to
the successor escrow agent all property and money held, and all records kept,
by the retiring Escrow Agent hereunder or in connection herewith.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (d) |  

Any corporation into or with which the Escrow Agent may be merged or
consolidated or amalgamated, or any corporation resulting therefrom to which
the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or
substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent shall be
the successor to the Escrow Agent hereunder without any further act on its
part or any of the parties hereto, provided that such corporation would be
eligible for appointment as a successor escrow agent hereunder.

    | (a) |  

Each party to this Agreement (other than the Escrow Agent) hereby represents
to the Escrow Agent that any account to be opened by, or interest to be held
by, the Escrow Agent in connection with this Agreement, for or to the credit
of such party, either (i) is not intended to be used by or on behalf of any
third party; or (ii) is intended to be used by or on behalf of a third party,
in which case such party hereto agrees to complete and execute forthwith a
declaration in the Escrow Agent's prescribed form as to the particulars of
such third party.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

The Escrow Agent shall retain the right not to act and shall not be liable for
refusing to act if, due to a lack of information or for any other reason
whatsoever, the Escrow Agent, in its sole judgment, determines that such act
might cause it to be in non-compliance with any applicable anti-money
laundering or anti-terrorist legislation, regulation or guideline. Further,
should the Escrow Agent, in its sole judgment, determine at any time that its
acting under this Agreement has resulted in its being in non-compliance with
any applicable anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist legislation, regulation
or guideline, then it shall have the right to resign on ten (10) days written
notice to the other parties to this Agreement, provided (i) that the Escrow
Agent's written notice shall describe the circumstances of such non-
compliance; and (ii) that if such circumstances are rectified to the Escrow
Agent's satisfaction within such ten (10) day period, then such resignation
shall not be effective.
