          WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Newco
have approved the merger of Newco with and into the Company (the "MERGER"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

          WHEREAS, Newco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Saguaro Utility Group I

of the ABCA or the DGCL, as applicable (the date and time of the filing of the
later of the Articles and Certificate of Merger with the ACC and the Delaware

Surviving Corporation following the Merger, until thereafter amended or repealed
in accordance with their terms and as provided under the ABCA.

          (b) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part
of the Company and Newco, the bylaws of Newco shall be the bylaws of the

in accordance with their terms or the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger and as provided under the ABCA.

          Section 1.05. Directors and Officers. The directors of Newco
                        ----------------------
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation following the Merger, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed or until their earlier death,

                                   ARTICLE II

or any shares of capital stock of Newco:

          (a) Common Stock of Newco. Each share of common stock of Newco
              ---------------------
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

          (b) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of
              --------------------------------------------
common stock, no par value, of the Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK") that is
owned by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the
Partnership, Newco or any subsidiary of Newco shall automatically be cancelled

                                       -2-
<PAGE>


          (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to the provisions
              ----------------------------------
of this Section 2.01, each share of Company Common Stock, other than shares
canceled or that remain outstanding pursuant to Section 2.01(b), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive $25.25 in cash (the "MERGER Consideration"), payable
without interest, to the holder of such share, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.02, of a certificate formerly evidencing such share (a
"CERTIFICATE").

          (d) Treatment of Stock Options and Other Employee Equity Rights.
              -----------------------------------------------------------

          (i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option
     to acquire Company Common Stock held by any Company Employee (as defined in
     Section 3.09(a)) (an "OPTION") granted under the Company's 1994 Outside
     Director Stock Option Plan, the Company's 1994 Omnibus Stock and Incentive
     Plan (which includes the Company Stock Unit Award Program) or otherwise
     (collectively, the "STOCK PLANS"), whether or not then exercisable, shall
     be cancelled by the Company, and except as otherwise agreed by Newco and
     the holder, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive at the
     Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter from the Surviving
     Corporation following the Merger in consideration for such cancellation an
     amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Company
     Common Stock previously subject to each such Option and (b) the excess, if
     any, of the Merger Consideration per share over the exercise price per
     share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Option, reduced by
     the amount of any withholding or other Taxes (as defined in Section
     3.08(n)) required by Law (as defined in Section 3.04(a)) to be withheld.

          (ii) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all
     such action as is necessary prior to the Effective Time to, effective as of
     the Effective Time, terminate all Stock Plans so that on and after the
     Effective Time no Company Employee shall have any Option to purchase shares
     of Company Common Stock or any other equity interest in the Company under
     any Stock Plan.

          Section 2.02. Exchange of Certificates.

act as agent (the "PAYING AGENT") for the payment of the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with this Article II. At or as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of cash required for the payment of the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with this
Article II. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation, provided that such investments shall be in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in

          (b) Exchange and Payment Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
              -------------------------------
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held
by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as
the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving
Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash payable in respect of the shares formerly
represented by such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the share transfer
books of the Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

          (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. Until
              ---------------------------------------------------
surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II. The
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid at the Effective
Time in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business
on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the close of business on the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

          (d) No Liability. None of Newco, the Surviving Corporation and the
              ------------
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying
Agent pursuant to this Article II which remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority (as
defined in Section 3.04(b)) shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation,


                                       -4-
<PAGE>


upon demand. Any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only
as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash, if any, to
which such holders may be entitled.

          (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
              -----------------
stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

          (f) Withholding Rights. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
              ------------------
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any applicable Taxes from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock.

                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          The Company hereby represents and warrants to Newco that:

          Section 3.01. Organization and Qualification. (a) Each of the
                        ------------------------------
Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
requisite power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of
the Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so duly qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually or
in the aggregate, does not have and could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means any state of
facts, change, development, event, effect, condition or occurrence that is
materially adverse to the business, properties, assets, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or results of operations of the Company (or the Surviving
Corporation) and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or that could reasonably be
expected to, directly or indirectly, prevent or materially impair or delay the
ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that such adverse effect arises from general economic, legal or
regulatory conditions affecting the electric or gas utility industry generally
that do not have a disproportionate effect on the Company; provided that the
fact that the Company shall fail to meet financial projections for periods
subsequent to the date of this Agreement shall not, in and of itself, constitute
a Material Adverse Effect, but this proviso shall in no way exclude from the
definition of Material Adverse Effect or from what constitutes a Material
Adverse Effect any state of facts, change, development, event, effect, condition
or occurrence that gave rise to, contributed to or caused such failure to meet
financial projections.

the Company or any of its subsidiaries received any notice of any such
violation. The Company has made available to Newco complete and correct copies

                (C) Millennium and its subsidiaries may make capital
            expenditures in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
            practice so long as none of the Company and its subsidiaries, except

            capital contributions (including any "keep well" or other Contract

            budget and in excess of the per project amounts budgeted therein so
            long as such capital expenditures neither (x) cause or would be
            reasonably likely to cause capital expenditures for 2004 to exceed
            the aggregate 2004 capital budget by more than $17,000,000 in the
            aggregate nor (y) exceed the budget specified for any individual

change-of-control protections), (iii) amend the terms of any outstanding Options
to purchase any equity of the Company or any subsidiary (including accelerating
the vesting or lapse of repurchase rights or obligations); or (iv) enter into,

contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Debt Financing).

          Section 5.03. Cooperation, Notification. (a) The Company shall, and
                        -------------------------
shall cause its subsidiaries to, confer on a regular and frequent basis with one

warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

          (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, discuss
with Newco any changes or proposed changes in their regulated rates or charges
or standards of service from those in effect on the date hereof and consult with
Newco prior to making any filing or any amendment thereto (other than filing or

with any Governmental Authority by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
related to the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise related to
regulated rates which is either inconsistent with any of the conditions or
standards set forth in Section 7.02(d) or material to the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company (i) shall provide Newco an
opportunity to review and comment on such filing and (ii) shall include in such
filing all comments reasonably proposed by Newco.

----------------------
promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as reasonably
practicable a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock for the purpose of
obtaining the Shareholder Approval (the "SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING"), and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain the Shareholder Approval. The
Company shall be required to hold the Shareholders' Meeting and comply with its
other obligations under this Agreement regardless of whether the Company Board
has effected a Change in Board Recommendation (as defined in Section 6.03(d)) in
accordance with Section 6.03(d). The obligations set forth in the preceding
sentence shall not be applicable if this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Article VIII.

          (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement, the Company shall file
the Proxy Statement with the SEC and the Company shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto and shall

          (c) The information supplied by Newco for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement shall not, at (i) the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the Company's shareholders and
(ii) the time of the Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior
to the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, any event or circumstance relating to
Newco, or its officers or directors, is discovered by Newco that should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Newco shall
promptly inform the Company (and the Company shall amend the Proxy Statement
accordingly). All documents that Newco is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply in
all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law, including the
Exchange Act.

          (d) The information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement shall not, at (i) the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the Company's shareholders and
(ii) the time of the Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior
to the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, any event or circumstance relating to
the Company or its subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, is
discovered by the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Newco (and
the Company shall amend the Proxy Statement accordingly). All documents that the
Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply in all material respects
with the requirements of applicable Law, including the Exchange Act.

          (e) The Company shall promptly notify Newco upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Newco with
copies of all correspondence between the Company and its officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, auditors, counsel, financial advisors and
other agents and representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES"), on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Newco an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and (ii) shall include in such document or
response all comments reasonably proposed by Newco.

          (f) Each of the Company Reports to be filed by the Company after the
date of this Agreement, when filed, will comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, each as
in effect on the date so filed. None of the Company Reports (including any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein)
to be filed by the Company after the date of this Agreement, when filed, will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

          (g) Each of the audited and unaudited financial statements (including
any related notes) included in the Company Reports to be filed by the Company
after the date of this Agreement, when filed, will comply in all material
respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, will have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and will
fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries at the respective date thereof and the consolidated results of its
and their operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments,
which were not and are not expected to be material in amount).

          Section 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) From the
                        --------------------------------------
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, afford Newco
and its Representatives and potential financing sources for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement reasonable access at all reasonable times to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other facilities
and to the books, personnel, Contracts and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries, and shall furnish Newco and its Representatives and potential
financing sources with all such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and
its subsidiaries as Newco and its Representatives and potential financing
sources may from time to time reasonably request, subject to requirements of
applicable Law. Newco, its Representatives and potential financing sources shall
have the right to conduct non-intrusive environmental and engineering
inspections of the real properties of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Newco acknowledges that none of Newco or its
Representatives and potential financing sources shall be entitled to perform
invasive environmental investigations. No investigation pursuant to this Section
6.02 shall affect any representations or warranties of the parties herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties.

          (b) Each of the Company and Newco will hold any nonpublic information,
including all information provided pursuant to Section 6.02(a), in confidence to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter
dated July 19, 2002 among the Company, J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC and the other
party thereto (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement or any other Contract to the contrary, each party to this
Agreement (and any Representative thereof) may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax
structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials
of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, however, that
neither party (nor any Representative thereof) shall disclose (i) any
information that is not relevant to an understanding of the U.S. federal income
tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
identity of any party to this Agreement (or any Representative thereof) or other
information that could lead any person to determine such identity or (ii) any
information to the extent such disclosure could result in a violation of any
federal or state securities laws.

          Section 6.03. No Solicitation of Transactions. (a) The Company
                        -------------------------------
agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives and each of the
Representatives of its subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, initiate,
solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing
information) any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or
offer (including any proposal from or offer to its shareholders) with respect to
(i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, tender offer, exchange offer,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,
joint venture or similar transaction involving it or any of its subsidiaries or
(ii) any purchase or sale of more than 10% of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any Company Securities or Subsidiary
Securities (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an
"ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL"). The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of
its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable efforts to cause
its Representatives and each of the Representatives of its subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, have any discussion with or provide any confidential
information or data to any person relating to an Alternative Proposal, or engage
in any negotiations concerning an Alternative Proposal, or otherwise facilitate
any effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal or accept an
Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company (acting at the
direction of the Company Board) or the Company Board shall be permitted to,
prior to the Shareholders' Meeting, engage in any discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any information or data to, any person in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Proposal by any such person, if and
only to the extent that, prior to engaging in such discussions or negotiations
or providing such information or data (i) the Company Board, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, concludes in good faith that the failure to take
such action could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by the Company
Board of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable law, (ii) the Company Board concludes in good faith, in consultation
with its financial advisors, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal (as defined in this Section 6.03(a)) or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company Board receives from
such person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar
and no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and (iv) the Company and each of its subsidiaries has complied with
its obligations under this Section 6.03. A "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" shall mean an
Alternative Proposal that constitutes a transaction that is more favorable to
the Company's shareholders (in their capacities as shareholders), from a
financial point of view and taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal, than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any proposed alterations of the terms of this Agreement
submitted by Newco in response thereto) and which the Company Board concludes is
reasonably capable of being consummated; provided that to be a Superior
Proposal, an Alternative Proposal must result in a third party (or the
shareholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the Company Common Stock (or the surviving or ultimate parent entity in
such transaction) or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

          (b) The Company shall notify Newco promptly (and in any event by 5:00
p.m. New York City time, on the next business day) of the receipt of any
inquiries, proposals or offers received by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such person and the material terms of


                                      -34-
<PAGE>


any inquiries, proposals or offers. The Company shall keep Newco reasonably
informed of the status of any such discussions or negotiations and of any
modifications to such inquiries, proposals or offers (the Company agreeing that
it and its subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with
any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company
from providing such information to Newco). The Company agrees that neither it
nor any of its subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of
its subsidiaries is a party and that it and its subsidiaries shall enforce the
provisions of any such agreement.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.03, (i) the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement (except as otherwise
specifically permitted in Article VIII), (ii) prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, none of the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement or other
Contract relating to an Alternative Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement that complies with the provisions of this Section 6.03) and (iii) this
Section 6.03 shall not affect any other obligation of the Company under this
Agreement, including its obligations to convene and hold the Shareholders'
Meeting in accordance with Section 6.01(a). Effective as of the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall terminate, the Company shall cause its subsidiaries
to terminate, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives and its subsidiaries' Representatives to terminate any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties that may be
ongoing with respect to any Alternative Proposal, shall take the necessary steps
to inform its and its subsidiaries' Representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 6.03 and shall request that all confidential
information previously furnished to any such third parties be returned promptly.

          (d) The Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not approve or
recommend an Alternative Proposal, or withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing), except as
explicitly provided in this Section 6.03(d). Prior to the time of the
Shareholders' Meeting, (i) in response to the receipt of an unsolicited bona
fide written Alternative Proposal, if the Company has complied with this Section
6.03 and the Company Board (A) concludes in good faith that such Alternative
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (and continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal after taking into account any modifications proposed by Newco during
any four business day period referred to below) and (B) after consultation with
outside legal counsel, has concluded in good faith that the failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by the Company Board
of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable law,
then, on the fourth business day following Newco's receipt of written notice
from the Company of the Company Board's intention to do so, the Company Board
may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal and, in connection with such
Superior Proposal, withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, the
Company Board Recommendation or (ii) in the absence of any Alternative Proposal,
if the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel, has
concluded in good faith that it is required to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable law, then,
on the fourth business day following Newco's receipt of written notice from the
Company of the Company Board's intention to do so, the Company Board may
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation (either event described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a


                                      -35-
<PAGE>


"CHANGE IN BOARD RECOMMENDATION"); provided, in each case, that during the
applicable four business day period, the Company shall be obligated to negotiate
in good faith with Newco (to the extent Newco desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that (x) in the
case of clause (i), such Alternative Proposal would no longer be determined in
good faith by the Company Board to be a Superior Proposal or (y) in the case of
clause (ii), the Company Board ceases to conclude that the failure to effect a
Change in Board Recommendation could reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable law.

          (e) The Company shall not take any action (i) to exempt any person
from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Sections 2741 and
2742 of the ABCA or "control share acquisitions" contained in Sections 2722
through 2725 of the ABCA (or any provisions similar to the foregoing sections)
or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply or (ii) to exempt any person
or transaction from the applicability of any provision of the Rights Agreement
or to amend or terminate the Rights Agreement or to redeem the rights issued
thereunder.

          (f) The Company and the Company Board may take and disclose to the
Company's shareholders a position in accordance with Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal; provided that the
foregoing will in no way (i) permit any action that would otherwise have been
prohibited under this Agreement, (ii) limit the obligation of the Company to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement or (iii) eliminate or modify
the effect that any action taken or disclosure made in accordance with such Rule
would have under this Agreement.

          Section 6.04. Employee Benefits Matters. Except as contemplated
                        -------------------------
herein, the Company, for the period ending on the last day of the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs, shall provide employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements which, in the aggregate, will provide benefits, as
applicable, to Company Employees which are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than those provided pursuant to the plans, programs and arrangements of the
Company (other than those related to Company Securities) in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time and set forth in Schedule 3.09(a); provided,
however, that nothing herein shall (x) prevent the amendment or termination of
any such plan, program or arrangement, (y) require that the Company (1) provide
or permit investment in the securities of the Company, (2) grant or award any
securities or securities-based compensation or benefit or (3) provide any
guaranteed bonus compensation, change of control protections or retention
awards, or (z) interfere with the Company's right or obligation to make such

          Section 6.05. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and
                        --------------------------------------------
Insurance. (a) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
---------
Corporation shall contain the provisions regarding liability of directors and
indemnification of directors and officers that are set forth, as of the date of
this Agreement, in the articles of incorporation and the bylaws, respectively,
of the Company and shall provide indemnification with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted by and in accordance with the ABCA from time to time, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the


                                      -36-
<PAGE>


rights thereunder of individuals who at or at any time prior to the Effective
Time were Company Employees.

          (b) The Surviving Corporation shall cause to be obtained at the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
years from the Effective Time with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing
policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the
Effective Time; provided that if such "tail" insurance policies are not
available at a cost not greater than the amount set forth on Schedule 6.05(b)
(the "INSURANCE Cap"), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be obtained as
much comparable insurance for as long a period (not to exceed six years from the
Effective Time) as is available for a cost not to exceed the Insurance Cap.

          (c) In furtherance of and not in limitation of the preceding
paragraph, Newco agrees that the officers and directors of the Company that are
defendants in all Actions commenced by shareholders of the Company with respect
to (x) the performance of their duties as such officers and/or directors under
federal or state Law (including Actions under federal and state securities Laws)
and (y) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any and all
such Actions commenced on or after the date of this Agreement (the "SUBJECT
LITIGATION") shall be entitled as a group to be represented, at the reasonable
expense of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, in the Subject Litigation
by one counsel (and Arizona counsel if appropriate and one local counsel in each
jurisdiction in which a case is pending) each of which such counsel shall be
selected by a plurality of such officer/director defendants (and reasonably
acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and, prior to the Effective Time,
Newco); provided that the Company shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and that a condition to the indemnification payments
provided in this Section 6.05 shall be that such officer/director defendant not
have settled any Subject Litigation without the consent of the Surviving
Corporation (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and, prior to the
Closing, Newco; and provided further that neither Newco, the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any
officer/director defendant when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
non-appealable, that indemnification of such officer/director defendant in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

          Section 6.06. Regulatory Approvals and Other Matters. (a) Each
                        --------------------------------------
party shall file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Department of Justice a premerger notification report under the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate such filings and any responses
thereto, to make such filings in a timely manner and to respond promptly to any
requests for additional information made by either of such agencies.

          (b) Each party shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts
to prepare promptly and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary Approvals from any
Governmental Authority and all other persons necessary or advisable to


                                      -37-
<PAGE>


consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Required
Approvals; provided, however, that (i) no party shall be obligated or permitted
to consent to any action or to make or offer to make any commitment or
undertaking or incur any liability or obligation, other than those commitments
and undertakings set forth in Section 6.06(c), without the consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood
that, without limiting the condition set forth in clause (B) of the first
sentence of Section 7.02(d)(i), consent may be withheld in a party's sole
discretion with respect to any matter that could increase in any material
respect the financial obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries) and (ii)
no party shall be obligated or permitted to consent to any action or to make or
offer to make any commitment or undertaking or incur any liability or obligation
that would be inconsistent with any of the conditions or standards set forth in
Section 7.02(d). Newco and the Company agree that they will consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all such necessary or advisable
Approvals; provided, however, that it is agreed that the Company shall have
primary responsibility for the preparation and filing of any applications with
the ACC for the ACC Approval and Newco shall have primary responsibility for the
preparation and filing of any applications with the FERC for the FERC Approval
and the SEC for the PUHCA Approval. Each of Newco and the Company shall have the
right to review and approve in advance drafts of all such necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents made or prepared
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party shall
promptly notify the other party of any failure or prospective failure to obtain
any such Approvals and shall provide copies of all Company Required Consents
obtained by it.

          (c) In the application filed with the ACC for the ACC Approval, Newco
     and the Company shall agree to the following undertakings:

          (i) TEP's and the Surviving Corporation's management and corporate
     headquarters shall remain in Tucson, Arizona.

          (ii) The present TEP and Company management team has developed
     constructive relationships with local, state and federal regulatory
     agencies. The Surviving Corporation shall support its and TEP's management
     team in continuing to build upon these relationships.

          (iii) The local operations of TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric, including
     employee and labor relations, shall be under the supervision of local
     management.

          (iv) TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric will not guarantee the obligations
     of the Surviving Corporation.

          (v) TEP's equity ratio to total capitalization should be improved to
     40% by providing up to $168,000,000 in equity contributions and by causing
     the $95,000,000 intercompany note of the Company to TEP to be repaid.

          (vi) Existing TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric assets shall be managed,
     including appropriate expansion of such asset base, to accommodate service
     territory growth.


                                      -38-
<PAGE>


          (vii) The Company and its subsidiaries have undertaken to achieve a
     high level of service to customers. The Surviving Corporation and its
     subsidiaries shall continue to invest adequate capital to provide safe,
     reliable and adequate service to the customers of TEP, UNS Gas and UNS
     Electric.

          (viii) An important part of the Company's business plan is for its
     subsidiaries to be actively engaged in charitable and community programs.
     The Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries shall continue to support
     and, where appropriate, enhance TEP's and the Company's (A) existing
     charitable and community corporate "giving programs", (B) education,
     environmental, economic and philanthropic partnerships and (C) consumer
     partnerships.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
     connection with obtaining any Approval from any Governmental Authority or
     any other person, none of Newco or any of its affiliates shall be required
     to pay or commit to pay any cash or other consideration, to make any
     commitment or to incur any liability or other obligation. No party to this
     Agreement shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory
     deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of
     the transactions contemplated hereby at the behest of any Governmental
     Authority without the consent and agreement of the other party to this
     Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          Section 6.07. Public Announcements. The initial press release
                        --------------------
concerning the Merger shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, Newco and
the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent
required by applicable Law or the requirements of the NYSE or the Pacific Stock
Exchange, in which case the issuing party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or making any
such public statement.

          Section 6.08. Financing. (a) Newco shall use commercially
                        ---------
reasonable efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Letters (and, with respect to the Notes Letter, Schedule
7.02(e)(i)), including using commercially reasonable efforts (i) to negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained
therein and (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to Newco in such
definitive agreements that are within its control. In the event any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources
contemplated in the Debt Letters, Newco shall use reasonable best efforts to
arrange any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more
favorable terms in the aggregate to Newco (as determined in the reasonable
judgment of Newco). Newco shall give the Company prompt written notice of (i)
any material breach by any party of the Financing Letters (or any definitive
agreements entered into pursuant to the Financing Letters or any replacements
thereof), (ii) any termination of any Financing Letter or (iii) any exercise of
any "market out" or "material adverse change" conditions contained in any of the
Debt Letters (or replacements thereof).

          (b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives to provide, all cooperation


                                      -39-

reasonably necessary in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing,

use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing, legal
opinions as may be reasonably requested by Newco and a new tax sharing agreement
among Holdings, the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company, effective as of
the Effective Time; provided that the Debt Financing may not require the payment
of any commitment or other similar fee by the Company or impose any other
liability on the Company prior to the Effective Time. In addition, in connection
with the obtaining of the Debt Financing, the Company agrees, at the request of
Newco, to call or cause its subsidiaries to call for prepayment or redemption,
or to prepay, redeem and/or renegotiate, as the case may be, any of the then
existing Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries; provided that (i) no
such prepayment or redemption shall actually be made until substantially
contemporaneous with or after, or, in the case of the call for prepayment,
immediately prior to or contemporaneous with, the Effective Time and (ii) no
such call for prepayment or redemption shall be required prior to the Effective
Time unless the terms of the Indebtedness permit the Company to condition such
call for prepayment or redemption on the occurrence of the Effective Time or to
withdraw such call for prepayment or redemption if the Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or prior to the applicable scheduled prepayment or redemption
date.

          Section 6.09. Resignations. At the Closing, the Company shall
                        ------------

Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
that are treated as dispositions to the Company under such rule and result from
the transactions contemplated by Article I or Article II of this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

     in this Section 7.02(d)) and such Final Orders shall not impose terms or


                                      -41-
<PAGE>


     conditions that, individually or in the aggregate, (A) have had or could
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material
     adverse effect upon the business, properties, assets, condition (financial
     or otherwise), prospects or results of operations of Newco, the Surviving
     Corporation, the Partnership or the respective businesses or assets thereof
     (a "NEWCO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT") or (B) have caused or could reasonably
     be expected to cause the rates (including the Competition Transition
     Charge) of any of the Utility Subsidiaries to be less favorable to the
     Surviving Corporation or any Utility Subsidiary than the rates applicable
     to such Utility Subsidiary on the date of this Agreement. For purposes of
     this Agreement, in the event that any Final Order includes terms or
     conditions that (1) subject either the Partnership or any Limited Partner
     (or any "affiliate" (within the meaning of PUHCA) of any such person) to
     any regulation under PUHCA, including any requirement to register as a
     "holding company" under PUHCA, or (other than under the terms of the Energy
     Policy Act of 2003 in the form passed by the United States House of
     Representatives on November 18, 2003, to the extent such Act becomes law)
     under any federal or Arizona Law relating to public utility holding
     companies enacted, promulgated or otherwise coming into effect after the
     date of this Agreement that imposes regulation material to the Partnership
     or any of its affiliates, (2) require (whether on an absolute or contingent
     basis) that, at any time, all or any of the subsidiaries, assets,
     operations or business of either the Partnership or any Limited Partner (or
     any "affiliate" (within the meaning of PUHCA) of any such person) be
     transferred, sold, spun off or distributed (whether in whole or in part) to
     shareholders, otherwise disposed of, liquidated or wound down, (3) require
     (x) any Limited Partner (or any "affiliate" (within the meaning of PUHCA)
     of any such person) to restructure its capitalization or amend any of its
     articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents)
     or (y) the Partnership (or any "affiliate" (within the meaning of PUHCA) of
     any such person) to restructure its capitalization or amend any of its
     articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents)
     in any material respect, in each case in order to permit it to qualify for
     an exemption from the requirement to register as a "holding company" under
     PUHCA, or from any other regulation under PUHCA or (other than under the
     terms of the Energy Policy Act of 2003 in the form passed by the United
     States House of Representatives on November 18, 2003, to the extent such
     Act becomes law) under any federal or Arizona Law relating to public
     utility holding companies enacted, promulgated or otherwise coming into
     effect after the date of this Agreement that imposes regulation material to
     the Partnership or any of its affiliates, following the Merger or in order
     to ensure that it will not become subject to any such regulation, then such
     terms and conditions shall be deemed to constitute a Newco Material Adverse
     Effect. A "FINAL ORDER" means an action by the relevant Governmental
     Authority which has not been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside,
     annulled or suspended, with respect to which any waiting period prescribed
     by Law before the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated has
     expired, and as to which all conditions to the consummation of such
     transactions prescribed by Law have been satisfied. Notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that PUHCA is
     repealed, then on and after the date such repeal becomes effective, the
     Required Approvals shall not include the PUCHA Approval for purposes of
     this Section 7.02(d)(i); provided that the obligations of the parties to
     comply with the provisions of Section 6.06(b) with respect to the PUHCA


                                      -42-
<PAGE>


     Approval shall in no way be diminished prior to the time any such repeal
     becomes effective.

          (ii) The Partnership and the Limited Partners shall have received
     evidence satisfactory to them in their reasonable judgment (including a
     "no-action" letter from the staff of the SEC) that none of the Limited
     Partners nor any of their respective "affiliates" (within the meaning of
     PUHCA) will become or otherwise be deemed to be a "holding company" or a
     "subsidiary company" or an "affiliate" or a "holding company" within the
     meaning of PUHCA, or (other than under the terms of the Energy Policy Act
     of 2003 in the form passed by the United States House of Representatives on
     November 18, 2003, to the extent such Act becomes law) under any federal or
     Arizona Law relating to public utility holding companies enacted,
     promulgated or otherwise coming into effect after the date of this
     Agreement that imposes regulation material to the Partnership or any of its
     affiliates following the Merger as a result of the transactions
     contemplated hereby.

          (iii) (A) Except as in existence on the date of this Agreement, in the
     reasonable judgment of Newco, there shall be no Law, Order, Approval or
     Contract that impairs or restricts, or could reasonably be expected to
     impair or restrict, the ability of any Utility Subsidiary from paying
     dividends or making distributions to its shareholders of all of such
     Utility Subsidiary's net income and (B) assuming the consummation of the
     transactions described in Section 6.06(c)(v) and the redemption in full by
     TEP of its variable-rate tax-exempt bonds outstanding as of the date of
     this Agreement which are supported by the Tranche B Letters of Credit under
     the Credit Agreement, in the reasonable judgment of Newco, there shall be
     no Law, Order, Approval or Contract (including any of the foregoing in
     existence on the date of this Agreement) that, as applied to TEP and its
     subsidiaries (the "TEP ENTITIES"), impairs or restricts, or could
     reasonably be expected to impair or restrict, the ability of each TEP
     Entity from paying dividends or making distributions of all of its net
     income to its shareholders; provided that in no event shall more than
     $168,000,000 in equity contributions be required to be provided to TEP or
     Indebtedness in addition to or in excess of $95,000,000 under the
     intercompany note of the Company to TEP be required to be repaid.

          (e) Financing. Holdings shall have received the proceeds of the Debt
              ---------
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Letters or upon
terms and conditions which are, in the reasonable judgment of Newco, comparable
or more favorable (to Newco) in the aggregate thereto, and to the extent that
any terms and conditions are not set forth in the Debt Letters, on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to Newco. For purposes of this Section
7.02(e), (i) the terms and conditions of the Senior Financing Letter are deemed
to include any applicable terms set forth in the Fee Letter (as defined in the
Senior Financing Letter) relating to changes required for successful syndication
and (ii) the terms and conditions of the debt financing described in the Notes
Letter shall be deemed comparable or more favorable in the aggregate to the
terms and conditions set forth in the Notes Letter if such terms and conditions
are, in the reasonable judgment of Newco, comparable or more favorable (to
Newco) in the aggregate to the terms set forth on Schedule 7.02(e)(i) and to the
extent that any terms are not set forth on Schedule 7.02(e)(i), on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to Newco. Newco shall have received evidence
that the Company and its subsidiaries shall have, prior to or contemporaneously
with the Closing, called for redemption the Indebtedness set forth on Schedule


                                      -43-
<PAGE>


7.02(e)(ii) or such other Indebtedness as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and Newco.

          (f) PBGC. There shall be (i) no conditions requested of the Company or
              ----
its subsidiaries or of Newco or the Surviving Corporation by the PBGC in
connection with any Pension Plan that are or could reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the Surviving Corporation and (ii) no commencement of any
Action by the PBGC to terminate any Pension Plan or to appoint a trustee of such
plan (or a reasonable good faith determination by Newco that the commencement of
such Action is reasonably likely).

          Section 7.03. Conditions to Obligation of the Company to Effect the
                        -----------------------------------------------------
Merger. The obligation of the Company to effect the Merger shall be further
------
subject to the satisfaction or, if permitted by applicable Law, waiver by the
Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions:

              ------------------------------
warranties of Newco (i) set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and
as of the Closing Date (except that if such representations and warranties speak
as of an earlier date they shall be true and correct as of such date); provided,
however, that for purposes of this clause, such representations and warranties
shall be deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or failures of all
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct, without giving
effect to any qualification as to materiality or material adverse effect set
forth in such representations or warranties, would, in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Newco to perform its obligations
hereunder and (ii) set forth in this Agreement that are not qualified by
materiality or material adverse effect shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though
made on and as of the Closing Date (except that if such representations and
warranties speak as of an earlier date they shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of such date). The Company shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Newco by its Chief Executive Officer or the
Chief Financial Officer of Newco to the foregoing effect.

          (b) Performance of Obligations of Newco. Newco shall have performed in
              -----------------------------------
all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Newco by its Chief Executive Officer or the
Chief Financial Officer to the foregoing effect.

          (c) Required Approvals. The Required Approvals shall have been
              ------------------
obtained at or prior to the Effective Time, such approvals shall have become
Final Orders and such Final Orders shall not impose terms or conditions that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that PUHCA is repealed, then on
and after the date such repeal becomes effective, the Required Approvals shall
not include the PUCHA Approval for purposes of this Section 7.03(c); provided
that the obligations of the parties to comply with the provisions of Section
6.06(b) with respect to the PUHCA Approval shall in no way be diminished prior
to the time any such repeal becomes effective.

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

          Section 8.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and
                        -----------
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding any shareholder approval of this Agreement, as follows (the date

          (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Company Board and
by Newco;

          (b) by the Company, on the one hand, or Newco, on the other hand, if
the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before March 31, 2005;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform its obligations
under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to have been consummated on or before such date;

          (c) by the Company, on the one hand, or Newco, on the other hand if
there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements or
any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part
of any of Newco, in the case of a termination by the Company, or the Company, in
the case of a termination by Newco, which breach, individually or together with
all other such breaches, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02 or
Section 7.03, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 30 days
following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or
timing cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date;

          (d) by either Newco or the Company, if (i) a Final Order with respect
to any Required Approval shall have been obtained or any Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction denies or otherwise fails to grant a Required Approval
and such denial or other failure has become a Final Order, in each case as a
result of which the condition set forth in Section 7.02(d) (in the case of a
termination by Newco) or Section 7.03(c) (in the case of a termination by the
Company) shall become incapable of being satisfied, or (ii) any Governmental
Authority shall have issued a Final Order or taken any other action permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, unless the failure of this condition to have been satisfied
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

          (e) by the Company (unless the Company is in breach of its obligations
under Section 6.01 or Section 6.03) or Newco, if the Shareholder Approval shall
not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the Shareholder
Approval upon the taking of a vote on the Shareholder Approval at the
Shareholders' Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof;

Board Recommendation or (ii) the Company shall have breached its obligations
under Section 6.01 or under Section 6.03;

          (g) by the Company, prior to the Shareholders' Meeting, if the Company
Board shall have effected a Change in Board Recommendation, the Company Board
has resolved to approve and recommend the Superior Proposal that caused it to
effect a Change in Board Recommendation and the Company has complied with its
obligations under Sections 6.01 and 6.03; or

          (h) by Newco, if an Alternative Proposal that is publicly announced
shall have been commenced or communicated in writing to the Company and (i) the
Company shall not have rejected such proposal within ten business days after the
date of the receipt thereof by the Company or after the date of its existence
first becomes publicly announced, if sooner, (ii) the Company Board shall have
approved or recommended such Alternative Proposal (or resolved to do so) or
(iii) the Company shall have failed to confirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten business days after being requested by Newco to do so.

concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness of a termination of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(g) and (y) within five
business days after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make
such payment in all other circumstances. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay under this Section 8.02 an amount in excess of the Termination
Fee plus the Termination Expenses. As used in this Agreement, "TERMINATION FEE"
means an amount equal to $15,000,000 (except that, with respect to a termination
of this Agreement under the circumstances set forth in Section 8.02(a)(iv)(A),
the "Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $18,000,000). As used in
this Agreement, "TERMINATION EXPENSES" means an amount, not to exceed
$10,000,000, equal to the documented out-of-pocket expenses of Newco, including
Newco's direct and indirect equity holders, incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the related financing
thereof (including all fees and expenses payable to financing sources or hedging
counterparties and the Representatives of Newco and/or its financing sources)

circumstances set forth in Section 8.02(a)(i) or Section 8.02(a)(iv)(A), the
"Termination Expenses" shall not exceed $7,000,000). For purposes of clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 8.02(a) only, the term "Alternative
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.03(a),
except that the reference to "10%" in the definition thereof shall be deemed to
be a reference to "50%".

          (c) In the event either party is required to file suit to seek all or
a portion of the Termination Fee and/or Termination Expenses, and it ultimately
succeeds, it shall be entitled to all expenses, including attorneys' fees and
expenses, which it has incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder.

          Section 8.03. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination
                        ---------------------
of this Agreement by either the Company or Newco as provided in Section 8.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Newco or the Company, other than the
provisions of Section 6.02(b), Section 8.02, this Section 8.03 and Article IX.
Nothing contained in this Section 8.03 shall relieve any party from liability
for its breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement; provided that following termination of this Agreement
by Newco or the Company as provided in Section 8.01, in the absence of a willful
breach no party shall be liable for damages in excess of $25,000,000 (including
any amounts paid pursuant to Section 8.02).

          Section 8.04. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by mutual
                        ---------
agreement of the parties at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that, after the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the
Company, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the
type of consideration into which each share of the Company Common Stock shall be
converted upon consummation of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties.

          Section 8.05. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
                        ------
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act
of any other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such


                                      -48-
<PAGE>


extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Agreement to Sections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a

"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The
term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are

the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither the
Company nor Newco makes any representations or warranties, written or oral,
statutory, express or implied, concerning itself or any of its affiliates, or

assigned by any of the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer on any person other than the parties or their respective successors and
assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of
this Agreement (except as provided in Section 6.05).

attached hereto and referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein and made a
part of this Agreement for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
State of Delaware in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement,
and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any Action for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such Action may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties irrevocably
agree that all claims with respect to such Action shall be heard and determined
in such a Delaware State or federal court. The parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers
in connection with any such Action in the manner provided in this Section 9.12
