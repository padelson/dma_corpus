or the Warrantors to the Buyer under this agreement is not paid when due it
shall bear interest both before and after any judgment at a yearly rate of 3
per cent above the Official Dealing Rate from time to time.  
      
  4.12  |   | If there is any Claim for any breach of any of the
Warranties or a Claim under the Tax Deed or under clause 4.8 or clause 9, the
Buyer shall have the right to set off any sum finally determined to be
payable by the Warrantors in respect of any loss suffered by the Buyer or
any Group Company in respect of such breach of the Warranties or the Tax Deed
against any unpaid part of the Consideration for the Sale Shares and/or
against the Consideration Loan Notes and/or against the Retention Loan Notes
and/or the B Loan Notes provided that, prior to setting any such sum off
against any unpaid part of the Consideration for the Sale Shares and/or
against the Consideration Loan Notes and/or against the B Loan Notes, the
Buyer will first set any such sum off against the Retention Loan Notes. If as
at the date on which any payment is due to be made by the Buyer to the
Warrantors in respect of any unpaid part of the Consideration for the Sale
Shares and/or under the Consideration Loan Notes and/or under the Retention
Loan Notes and/or under the B Loan Notes there are any Claims which have
been intimated but not finally determined, the Buyer may continue to withhold
payment of an amount equivalent to the amount reasonably claimed pending such
Claim being finally determined and to the extent that such Claim is finally
determined in the Warrantors favour the Buyer shall pay to the Warrantors
interest (in addition to any interest payable to the Warrantors under
the relevant Loan Note or this agreement save where otherwise provided in
such Loan Note or this agreement) on the amount withheld at a rate of 5% over
LIBOR from the due date for payment until payment in full compounded
monthly.  
      
  4.13  |   | The Principal Sellers undertake and warrant to the Buyer
that the Group Companies shall be entitled to the Available Tax Benefit
Amount of at least £3,397,270. If the aggregate Available Tax Benefit Amount
is less than the sum of £3,397,270 as determined on the last Redemption Date
in accordance with the B Loan Note Instrument, the Principal Sellers
shall jointly and severally covenant to pay to the Buyer an amount which is
equal to the amount by which the aggregate Available Tax Benefit Amount is
less than £3,397,270.  
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     4.14  |   | If there is any Claim under clause 4.13 the Buyers
sole remedy shall be to set off such sum determined in accordance with clause
4.13 against the B Loan Notes and such breach shall not otherwise give rise
to any right of the Buyer against the Principal Sellers nor to any right to
withhold performance of any obligation owed to them on the part of the Buyer
howsoever arising other than to withhold performance of the obligation to
make payment of the B Loan Notes to the extent specified in this clause
4.14.  
---|---|--- 
      
  4.15  |   | The right of set off in clause 4.14 is without prejudice to
any other right which the Buyer may have against the Principal Shareholders
or Management, whether under the terms of this agreement or otherwise.

    |   | _Limitations not to apply_

Claim under this agreement or under the Tax Deed against the Warrantors:

the consequence of fraud, or dishonesty on the part of the Warrantors or
their agents or Advisers; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | which is the result of a breach of a Warranty in part 1
or part 2 of schedule 8; or  
      
    | (c)  |   | which is the result of a Claim under clause 2.2 of the
Tax Deed.  
   

  

       |   | _Time limits_   
---|---|--- 
      
  5.2  |   | Subject to clause 5.9, the rights of the Buyer in respect of
any Claim for breach of a Warranty (other than a Warranty in part 8
(Pensions) or part 10 (Tax) of schedule 8) shall only be enforceable if the
Buyer gives written notice to the Warrantors (giving so far as practicable
the amount and details of the Claim) on or before the second anniversary
of Completion.  
      
  5.3  |   | Subject to clause 5.9 the rights of the Buyer in respect of

enforceable if the Buyer gives written notice to the Warrantors (giving so

    |   | _Threshold_   
      
  5.4  |   | The Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Claim

such liability and not merely for the excess).  
      
    |   | _Maximum Claims_   
      
  5.5  |   | Where there have been breaches of the Warranties or Claims
have arisen under the Tax Deed, then (subject to clause 5.1) the Buyer shall

as are paid or become payable under the B Loan Notes, and/or the

aggregate cap of £50,000,000.

---|---|--- 
      
  5.6  |   | The Buyer shall not be entitled to recover from the
Warrantors under the Warranties and the Tax Deed more than once in respect of
the same damage suffered, and accordingly the Warrantors shall not be liable
in respect of any breach of the Warranties to the extent that the loss is or
has been included in a Claim under the Tax Deed to the extent that it has been
satisfied, nor shall the Warrantors be liable in respect of a Claim under the
Tax Deed to the extent that the loss is or has been included in a Claim for
breach of the Warranties to the extent that it has been satisfied.  
      
    |   | _Contingent liabilities_   
      
    |   | The time limits in clauses 5.2 and 5.3 shall not limit any
Claim in respect of a liability which is contingent or unascertained where
written notice of the Claim (giving so far as practicable the amount and
details of the Claim) is given to the Warrantors before the expiry of the
relevant periods specified in those clauses.  
      
    |   | _Disclosure Letter_   
      
  5.7  |   | Subject to the provisions of clause 5.8, the Warrantors shall
be under no liability under the Warranties in respect of any matter to the

       | (a)  |   | only the disclosures in Part 10  Tax of the

Disclosed against the Warranties in part 10 (Tax) of schedule 8;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | only the disclosures in Part 8  Pensions of the
Disclosure Letter (to the extent Disclosed) shall be treated as having been
Disclosed against the Warranties in part 8 (Pensions) of schedule 8; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | nothing in the Disclosure Letter shall limit the
Warrantors liability under the Warranties in part 1 or part 2 of schedule 8
or the Tax Deed.  
   

  

       |   | _Time Limits for Making Claims_   
---|---|--- 
      
  5.9  |   | Any Claim for breach of a Warranty in respect of which notice
shall have been given in accordance with clause 5.2 or 5.3 (as the case may

previously satisfied settled or withdrawn) if proceedings in respect of such
Claim have not been issued and served on the Warrantors not later than

    |   | _Recovery from Third Parties_   
      
  5.10  |   | Where the Buyer is entitled to recover from some third party
(including without limitation the Groups insurers) any sum in respect of any
matter giving rise to a Claim under the Warranties then the Buyer shall, at
the Warrantors expense, procure that reasonable steps are taken to enforce
such recovery and if any sum is so recovered then either the amount
payable by the Warrantors in respect of that Claim shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the sum so recovered (less the reasonable costs and expenses
of recovering it and any Tax payable by the Buyer as a result of its receipt)
or (if an amount shall already have been paid by any of the Warrantors in
respect of that Claim) there shall be repaid to the Warrantors an amount
equal to the amount so recovered (less the reasonable costs and expenses of
its recovery and any Tax payable by the Buyer as a result of its receipt) or
(if less) the amount of such payment  
     

  #####

    |   | _Further Limitations_   
      
  5.11  |   | The Warrantors shall have no liability (or such liability
shall be reduced) in respect of any Claim under any of the Warranties (other

for or in respect of the liability or other matter giving rise to such Claim
has been made in the Accounts or the Completion Accounts;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | if and to the extent that such Claim occurs or is
increased as a result of any change in legislation after the date of this
agreement (or any legislation not in force at the date of this agreement)
which takes effect retrospectively, or the withdrawal after the date of this
agreement of any published concession or published general practice
previously made by HM Revenue and Customs or other applicable Taxation
Authority;  
      
    | (c)  |   | if and to the extent that such Claim is attributable to
any voluntary act or omission of the Company or the Buyer in relation to the
Company carried out after Completion otherwise than in the ordinary course of
business unless such act:-  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | was carried out pursuant to a legally binding
obligation of the Company entered into on or before Completion; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | was carried out with the written consent or at the
request of the Warrantors; and  
   

  

       | (d)  |   | if and to the extent such Claim would not have
arisen but for any change after Completion in the bases on which the Accounts
were prepared unless such policies or practices adopted in the preparation of
the Accounts are changed to comply with UK GAAP or because of a change in UK
GAAP announced and coming into force after the Completion Date.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | _Limiting Loss_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

     5.12  |   | In the event that a breach of Warranty (other than a
Tax Warranty) has occurred and the Buyer is or becomes aware that the
circumstances constituting the breach of Warranty are continuing such that
the loss accruing to the Buyer from that breach of Warranty is increasing then
the Buyer shall, if it is within its control to do so, take reasonable steps
to prevent the breach from continuing and take normal prudent commercial
steps to limit its loss as a consequence of such breach (but without being
required to pay any sum the subject of or arising by virtue of the breach of
Warranty or any related interest, penalty or similar financial cost).

which Third Party Claim is likely to result in the Buyer bringing a Claim (a
"Relevant Claim") under the Warranties

       |   |   | (other than the Tax Warranties) in relation to the

Relevant Claim within seven days from the day on which such Third Party Claim
comes to the notice of the Buyer, the Company or relevant Subsidiary
Undertaking.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Subject to the Buyer being indemnified and secured to
its reasonable satisfaction the Buyer shall, and shall procure that the
Company and any of its Subsidiary Undertakings shall consult with the
Warrantors as to the conduct of such Third Party Claim and shall obtain the
prior consent of the Warrantors to the settlement of such Third Party Claim,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and for this purpose
it shall be unreasonable to withhold or delay consent where to do so would be
likely to be materially prejudicial to the business of the Group or any Group
Company.

Shares on the terms of this agreement the Guarantor unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to the Sellers (and in the case of the Management
Bonus, the Management Team) (together the "Indemnified Parties"):  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the payment by the Buyer when due of any amount
payable under this agreement; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the due and punctual performance and observance by the
Buyer of its obligations, commitments, undertakings and indemnities under or
pursuant to this agreement,  
   

  

       |   | as if the Guarantor were the principal obligor under this
agreement and not merely a surety.  
---|---|--- 
      
  15.2  |   | The guarantee set out in Clause 15.1 is a continuing
guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect until all the obligations
and liabilities of the Buyer guaranteed by this Clause 15 have been
discharged in full. This guarantee is in addition to and without prejudice to
and not in substitution for any rights or security which the Indemnified
Parties may now or hereafter have or hold for the performance and observance
of the obligations guaranteed by the Guarantor.  
      
  15.3  |   | The Guarantor acknowledges that its liability under this
Clause 15 shall not be discharged or affected in any way by time or any other
indulgence or concession being granted by any of the Indemnified Parties
other than as expressed to be for the benefit of the Guarantor.  
      
  15.4  |   | The Guarantor will indemnify the Indemnified Parties against
all losses, proceedings, claims, liabilities, costs and expenses suffered or
incurred by the Indemnified Parties as a result of the Buyer failing to
discharge its obligations and liabilities in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this agreement. Nothing herein shall require the Guarantor to
pay amounts if and to the extent that the Buyer is entitled to set off a
claim or other sum under this agreement (including without limitation under
clause 4.12 hereof)  
      
  15.5  |   | If and whenever the Buyer defaults in the performance of any
obligation under this agreement the Guarantor will immediately upon demand
perform it or procure the performance of it subject always to any rights of
set off permitted to the Buyer under or pursuant to this agreement so that
the same benefits shall be conferred on the  
    

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   | Indemnified Parties as it would have received if it had
been duly performed and satisfied by the Buyer.  
---|---|--- 
      
  15.6  |   | The Indemnified Parties will be entitled to enforce the
Guarantors obligations without making any demand on or taking proceedings
against the Buyer and will not be required before enforcing the Guarantors
obligations to pursue any other right, remedy or security which it may
have.  
      
  15.7  |   | As a separate and independent stipulation the Guarantor
agrees that any obligation of the Buyer which may not be enforceable against
or recoverable from the Buyer by reason of any legal limitation, disability
or incapacity on or of the Buyer will nevertheless be enforceable against and
recoverable from the Guarantor as though the Guarantor were the sole or
principal obligor and shall be performed by the Guarantor on demand if then
due for performance by the Buyer subject always to any rights of set off
permitted to the Buyer under or pursuant to this agreement.  
      
  15.8  |   | Subject to Clause 15.9 where any payment is made by the
Guarantor under this Clause 15 and that sum is subject to a charge to
Taxation in the hands of the recipient (and the recipient is a Seller or
Warrantor) by reason only that the payment is made by the Guarantor rather
then by the Buyer (other than (i) Taxation attributable to a payment being
properly treated as an adjustment to the Consideration paid by the Buyer for
the Company or (ii) Taxation which would be payable had the payment been
received from the Buyer) the sum payable under this clause 15 shall be
increased to such sum as will ensure that after payment of such Taxation (and
after giving credit for any tax relief available to the recipient in respect
of the matter giving rise to the payment) the recipient shall be left with a
sum equal to the sum that it would have retained after Taxation had the
recipient actually received a payment from the Buyer in accordance with the
terms of this agreement.  
      
  15.9  |   | The parties to the agreement undertake that they shall take
all reasonable steps to ensure that any payment made by the Guarantor is not
subject to a greater amount of Taxation to the recipient (where the recipient
is a Seller or Warrantor) than would have been the case if any payment had
been made by the Buyer including having any payment due from the Guarantor
paid first to the Buyer and then to the Indemnified Parties or procuring that
the Buyer makes such payments to the Indemnified Parties so far as such
arrangements are not otherwise prejudicial to the Buyer or the Indemnified
Parties.

writing signed by him.
