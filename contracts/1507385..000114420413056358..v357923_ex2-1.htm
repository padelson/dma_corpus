that that to the extent fewer than two (2) of the (3) individuals set forth

change, then (without limiting any other rights of the Parent
Parties hereunder), the Merger Consideration shall be ratably adjusted to

6.2(c)(iii)_ , if at any time during the period between the date of this

Section 3.2 _Proration_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to this
_Article III_ , including _Section 3.10_ (the " _Cash Conversion Number_ ")
shall be equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of
twenty percent (20%) times the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of
Company Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.10_ ). All
other shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ ) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration.

Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among
former holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

  



  

(i)  If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (the " _Cash
Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock
Election Shares and all Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive the Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares held by a holder
thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with _Section 3.2(a)_ , whether fractions of Cash
Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number
of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration; and

  



  

(ii)  If the Cash Election Number is less than or equal to the
Cash Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Electing Shares and
Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Election Procedures_. Subject to the terms of the
Letter Agreement, each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (subject
to _Section 3.10(c)_ ) each holder of Company RSUs or Company PSUs (any of
the foregoing, a " _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article III_ , to submit an election on or
prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the following procedures:

  



  

   

-21- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a)  Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 3.3_ (herein called an " _Election_ ")
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with
respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

  



  

(b)  Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Form of Election_ "), which shall be mailed by the Company to
record holders of Company Common Stock and delivered to holders of Company
RSUs and Company PSUs so as to permit those holders to exercise their right
to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered,
as applicable, the Form of Election to record holders of Common Stock and
holders of Company RSUs and Company PSUs as of the record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Election Deadline (the " _Mailing Date_ "). Parent shall make
available one or more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from
time to time by all persons who become holders or beneficial owners of
Company Common Stock during the period following the record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline.

  



  

(d)  Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint an exchange
agent, which shall be a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of receiving Elections and
exchanging shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates for
Merger Consideration, pursuant to an exchange agent agreement entered
into prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). Subject
to the terms of the Letter Agreement, any Election shall have been made
properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the Election
Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by
Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock to which such
Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor
institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ ,
that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the
time required in such guarantee of delivery, and, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the
Form of Election. Failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered
by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee
shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless
otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion. As used
herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Company and Parent, "
_Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the
principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the later of (i) the
date immediately prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (ii) the date
that Parent and the Company shall agree is two (2) Business Days prior to the
expected Closing Date. The Company and Parent shall issue a press release
reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the anticipated date of
the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at
least five (5) Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline. If the Closing
is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly
delayed to a subsequent date (which shall be the second (2nd) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date) and the Company and Parent shall cooperate to
promptly publicly announce such rescheduled Election Deadline and Closing.

(e)  Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery
of such Certificates, or any documents in respect of Book-Entry Shares,
previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an Election is validly
made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, any subsequent
transfer of such shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically revoke
such Election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of written notification from Parent or the Company that this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_. Subject to the terms
of the Exchange Agent Agreement and this Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made
with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock (neither Parent nor the
Company nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder
of any such defect); in the event the Exchange Agent makes such a
determination, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the
shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes
hereof, be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares, unless a proper Election is
thereafter timely made with respect to such shares.

  



  

(f)  Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement,
Parent and the Company, in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, shall
have the joint right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the manner and extent to which
Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed
by _Section 3.2_ , (ii) the issuance and delivery of certificates
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of
Company Common Stock are converted into the right to receive in the Merger and
(iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, at the Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this _Article
III_ , (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form issuable
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_  equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration and
(ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration
(together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.14_ ) (collectively, the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this
Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by
the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Entity. Interest
and other income on the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent and the Surviving Entity and shall be paid to Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as Parent directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall
relieve Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent from making the
payments required by this _Article III_ , and following any losses from any
such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy Parent's obligations
hereunder for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at
the Effective Time, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Exchange Fund.

Section 3.5 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share immediately prior to the Effective Time a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, in such form as the
Company and Parent may reasonably agree. Upon proper surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration (which, to the extent it is Stock
Consideration, shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, Persons who held shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein.
On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange
Agent or the Surviving Entity for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to such Certificate in accordance with this Agreement,
and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Parent to the
Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until
the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
there shall be paid to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

Section 3.8 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect
thereto) which remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of
Company Common Stock on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore received any Merger
Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
applicable dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock) to which they are entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter
look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment of their claims with
respect thereto.

  



  

Section 3.9 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer,
director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of any cash that would have
otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a)   _Restricted Share Units_. Each Company RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, effective

documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements

(c)  The records, systems, controls, data and information of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of
internal accounting controls described in the following sentence are recorded,
stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive
ownership and direct control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions
are executed only in accordance with management's authorization; (2)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to maintain
accountability for the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is compared with
existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. The Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed to the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls, and the Company has
made available to Parent copies of any material written materials relating to
the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic

documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements
thereto, from and after January 1, 2012 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC
Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of

material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective
in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented,
as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Merger Sub nor any
other Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act.

(b)  Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented
or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was
prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

  



  

(c)  The records, systems, controls, data and information of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal
accounting controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or accountants, except
for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not
reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with
management's authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts,
notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper
and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Parent's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to Parent's auditors and the audit
committee of the Parent Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parent's internal controls, and Parent has made
available to the Company copies of any material written materials relating to
the foregoing. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent
required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including
its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parent's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parent's periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited
loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

thereof.

an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party made
after the date of this Agreement (i) furnish non-public information to

Party shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent or Merger Sub,
be provided to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or substantially at the same time
that such information is provided to such Third Party), and (ii) engage in

(d)  Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_ , neither the

Proposal and each material modification to an Acquisition Proposal, if any)
(any of the actions described in clauses _(i)_ , _(ii)_ ,  _(iii)_ and _(iv)_

approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or
propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or
permit any Company Entity to enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with this _Section 6.5_ ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board shall be permitted to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board (A) (x) has received an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 6.5_ ) that, in the good faith determination of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and
giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by the Parent
Parties pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)_ , and such Acquisition Proposal is not
withdrawn, and (y) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' duties under applicable Law, and in such case the Company may
(i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or (ii) make
an Adverse Recommendation Change, including approving or recommending such
Superior Proposal to the Company's stockholders, and, in the case of a
termination, the Company may immediately prior to or concurrently with such
termination of this Agreement, enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable Law
(based on circumstances not covered by clause (A)), and, in such case
the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, _provided_ , _that_ ,
in the case of each of clause (A) and clause (B), in the event of any
termination by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , as may be applicable, the Company complies with its
obligation to pay the Termination Payment pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_.

  



  

(e)  The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_  unless (i) the
Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") to the Parent Parties that the Company intends to take such
action, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and, in the case
of an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)(A)_ ,
describing the material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete
copy of, the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (it being
understood that such material terms shall include the identity of the Third
Party), (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following the Parent
Parties' receipt of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the
Parent Parties in good faith (to the extent the Parent Parties desire to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Adverse Recommendation Change is no longer necessary,
and (iii) following the end of the three (3) Business Day period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Parent Parties in response to the Notice
of Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise, (x) that in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to  _Section 6.5(d)(A)_ , the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (y) after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' duties under applicable Law. After compliance with this
_Section 6.5(e)_ with respect to any two (2) Superior Proposals, the Company
shall have no further obligations under this _Section 6.5(e)_ , and the
Company Board shall not be required to comply with such obligation with
respect to any other Superior Proposal.

stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board has determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with

"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any
applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company

(b)  In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each
of the Parent Parties and the Company shall give (or shall cause the other

any state of facts, change, development, event or condition would cause, or

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by the
Company or the Parent Parties to provide such prompt notice under this
_Section 6.7(b)_ shall not constitute a breach of covenant for purposes of

without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order

of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the

case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years

period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from one or more insurance
carriers with the same or better Best's credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions
and retentions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under the Company's existing policies and with limits of
liability that are no lower than the limits on the Company's existing
policies as long as the annual premium in the aggregate does not exceed in
any one year three hundred percent (300%) of the annual aggregate premium(s)
under the Company's existing policies. If the Company or the Surviving Entity
for any reason fails to obtain such " _tail_ " insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Company's
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or
better Best's credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii)
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Indemnitees who are insured under the Company's DandO Insurance with comparable
DandO Insurance that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier, that is no less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of the Company (which may
be provided under Parent's DandO Insurance policy) or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;

material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which such statements are made, not misleading.

obligation of the Company to remain in effect from and after the Closing and
the Company shall consult with and keep the Parent Parties reasonably
informed of the status of their efforts to keep any Debt Financing that is an
obligation of the Company in effect after the Closing and notify the Parent
Parties promptly if they become aware of any circumstances (including
communications from the Agent) reasonably likely to result in any Debt
Financing that is an obligation of the Company not remaining in effect after
the Closing. The Parent Parties shall keep the Company reasonably informed of
the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate any Debt Financing.
Anything in this _Section 6.17_ to the contrary notwithstanding, until the

Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers or directors, as the case

written request of the Company, be required to incur any other out of pocket
expenses (other than immaterial incidental expenses) in connection with the

electronic mail) by the Company (such written request to include invoices or
other reasonably detailed evidence of the out of pocket costs or expenses
incurred that are requested to be reimbursed hereunder), reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives in connection with any action taken by any
of them at the request of the Parent Parties or their Financing Sources
pursuant to, and in accordance with, this _Section 6.17_ , and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all damages, losses, costs,

Dividend. If the Company determines it is necessary to declare the Additional
Dividend Amount, the Company shall notify Parent of such determination at
least ten (10) days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting. If Parent
determines it is necessary to declare the Parent Additional Dividend Amount,

and unpaid interest and all prepayment, defeasance or other fees and
penalties) required to be paid by the Company or any other Company Entity
under the Company Credit Agreement to cause the termination thereof on the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _Funded Debt Payoff Amount_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Company Entity
shall be obligated, by virtue of this Agreement, to make any prepayments with
respect to the amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement (i)
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) unless Parent or Merger Sub provides funds
to the Company in an amount sufficient to, or places in escrow or otherwise
pays on behalf of such Company Entity, the Funded Debt Payoff Amount.

(a)  If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated:

  



  

(i)  by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) and (A) in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), the Parent Stockholder Approval

(iii)  by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ , and (x) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition

publicly announced intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn without
qualification before such termination), and (y) the Company, within twelve
(12) months of the termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction
regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which is later consummated with

paid, to Parent the Termination Fee (less, if previously paid pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ above, the Parent Expense Amount), by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by Parent, not later than the
consummation of such transaction arising from such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_ , the
references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)"; or

  



  

(iv)  by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , then the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent as a
condition to the effectiveness of such termination; or

  



  

(v)  by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , then the

(2) Business Days of such termination; or

  



  

(vi)  by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section

and ten million dollars ($110,000,000) by wire transfer of same day funds to

Superior Proposal (as defined in the ARCT IV Merger Agreement) by ARCT IV and
the ARCT IV Merger Agreement is terminated by ARCT IV pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii) of the ARCT IV Merger Agreement or by Parent pursuant to Section

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the parties agree that:

  



  

   

-109- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i)  under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be
required to pay the Termination Payment or the Parent Termination Payment, as
applicable, earlier than one (1) full Business Day after receipt of
appropriate wire transfer instructions from the party entitled to payment;
and

  



  

(ii)  under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be
required to pay the Termination Payment or the Parent Termination Payment on
more than one occasion.

  



  

(d)  Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination
Payment nor the Parent Termination Payment is a penalty, but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, either the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for
the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , such paying party
shall pay the other party its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%)
for the period from the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(e)   (i) If one party to this Agreement (the " _Termination
Payor_ ") is required to pay another party to this Agreement (the "
_Termination Payee_ ") the Termination Payment or Parent Termination
Payment, as the case may be, such Termination Payment or Parent Termination
Payment, as the case may be, shall be paid into escrow on the date such
payment is required to be paid by the Termination Payor pursuant to this
Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow
account designated in accordance with this _Section 8.3(e)_. In the event
that the Termination Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Payee the
Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, the
amount payable to the Termination Payee in any tax year of the Termination
Payee shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment or Parent
Termination Payment, as the case may be, payable to the Termination Payee, and
(ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination
Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements
of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year,
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ ") and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown
sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by the Termination Payee's independent accountants, plus (B) in
the event the Termination Payee receives either (x) a letter from the
Termination Payee's counsel indicating that the Termination Payee has
received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(e)_ or
(y) an opinion from the Termination Payee's outside counsel as described
below in this _Section 8.3(e)_ , an amount equal to the excess of the
Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, less
the amount payable under clause (A) above.

  



  

   

-110- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii)  To secure the Termination Payor's obligation to pay these
amounts, the Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash
equal to the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case
may be, with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on such terms
(subject to this _Section 8.3(e)_ ) as shall be mutually agreed upon by
the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow agent. The
payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment or Parent
Termination Payment, as the case may be, pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_
shall be made at the time the Termination Payor is obligated to pay the
Termination Payee such amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_ by wire transfer. The
escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment or Parent
Termination Payment, as the case may be, in escrow or any portion
thereof shall not be released to the Termination Payee unless the escrow
agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the
Termination Payee's independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that
can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Payee without causing the
Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute Qualifying Income and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of
income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Termination Payee, or (ii) a letter from the Termination Payee's counsel
indicating that (A) the Termination Payee received a ruling from the IRS
holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Termination Payment
or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B) the Termination Payee's outside
counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the
Termination Payee of the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment,
as the case may be, should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, to the
Termination Payee. The Termination Payor agrees to amend this _Section
8.3(e)_ at the reasonable request of the Termination Payee in order to (i)
maximize the portion of the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment,
as the case may be, that may be distributed to the Termination Payee
hereunder without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii) assist the
Termination Payee in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its
outside counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section 8.3(e)_. Any
amount of the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case
may be, that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as
soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _Section 8.3(e)_.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable
Law, this Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto
by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or
similar governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval and prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained,
there shall not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the
amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement
to the holders of Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in
accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval
of the stockholders of the Company or Parent without such further approval of
such stockholders, or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under
applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Sections 9.7_ , _9.11_ , _9.12_  and _9.14,_ and
this sentence (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would
modify the substance of _Sections 9.7_ , _9.11_ , _9.12_ or _9.14_ , or this
sentence) may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in any manner
that negatively impacts or is otherwise adverse in any respect to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources

performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of _Section 8.4_ , waive compliance with any agreement or
condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and
Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and filing of
the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy
Statement, other than attorneys' and accountants' fees.

  



  

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to
Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from
any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the Company Common Stock,
all Transfer Taxes.

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect promptly the original intent of the parties as closely as possible
in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the Surviving
Entity, neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits, Annexes and Appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not
intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, except for the provisions of _Section 6.10_  (from and after the
Effective Time), which shall be to the benefit of the parties referred to in
such section and except for _Sections 9.11_ , _9.12_ and _9.14_ (of which any
Financing Sources shall be third party beneficiaries and may enforce such
provisions). The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_
without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the
parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do
not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original

agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Maryland, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision
or rule (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Maryland.

Agreement, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such

between the parties irrevocably waiving any objections to venue or
convenience of forum.
