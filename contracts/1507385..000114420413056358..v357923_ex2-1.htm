Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise
properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise

The Company and Parent shall issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the anticipated date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline.
If the Closing is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date (which shall

</FONT></FONT>The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are used in
the system of internal accounting controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except
for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect
on the system of internal accounting controls. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance
with management&rsquo;s authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries;
(3) access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded
accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis.
The Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Company&rsquo;s auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company&rsquo;s internal controls, and the Company has made available to Parent copies of any
material written materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating
to the Company required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
known to the Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to material information required to be included in the Company&rsquo;s periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has made any
prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).</P>

authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is
permitted only in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is compared with existing
assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. Parent&rsquo;s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to Parent&rsquo;s auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent&rsquo;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data,
and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent&rsquo;s
internal controls, and Parent has made available to the Company copies of any material written materials relating to the foregoing.
Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent required to be included in reports filed under
the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parent&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in timely alerting Parent&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information required
to be included in Parent&rsquo;s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of
Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).</P>

coverage; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the D&amp;O Insurance in excess of (for any one year) three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by

such amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect

any circumstances (including communications from the Agent) reasonably likely to result in any Debt Financing that is an obligation
of the Company not remaining in effect after the Closing. The Parent Parties shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of its efforts to arrange and consummate any Debt Financing. Anything in this <U>Section 6.17</U> to the contrary notwithstanding,

reimbursed by Parent upon written request of the Company, be required to incur any other out of pocket expenses (other than immaterial
incidental expenses) in connection with the Debt Financing. Parent shall promptly, upon written request (which may include electronic
mail) by the Company (such written request to include invoices or other reasonably detailed evidence of the out of pocket costs
or expenses incurred that are requested to be reimbursed hereunder), reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out
of pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their

</FONT></FONT>To secure the Termination Payor&rsquo;s obligation to pay these amounts, the Termination Payor shall deposit into
escrow an amount in cash equal to the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, with an escrow agent
selected by the Termination Payor on such terms (subject to this <U>Section 8.3(e)</U>) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the

shall provide that the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, in escrow or any portion thereof
shall not be released to the Termination Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a
letter from the Termination Payee&rsquo;s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow
agent to the Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the Termination Payee has
$1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Termination Payee, or (ii)
a letter from the Termination Payee&rsquo;s counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Payee received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
or (B) the Termination Payee&rsquo;s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, should either constitute Qualifying Income
or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow
agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, to the Termination
Payee. The Termination Payor agrees to amend this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(e)</U> at the reasonable request of the Termination Payee
in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment, as the case may be, that may be
distributed to the Termination Payee hereunder without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii)&nbsp;assist the Termination Payee in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from
its outside counsel, in each case, as described in this <U>Section 8.3(e)</U>. Any amount of the Termination Payment or Parent
Termination Payment, as the case may be, that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible
during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this <U>Section 8.3(e)</U>.</P>
