### (a) From and after the date hereof for a period not to exceed 12 months

specified therein, subject to the approval of any relevant Governmental
Authority pursuant to the Governing Regulatory Documents and to any required
consent, authorization, approval or similar item from any non-governmental

## Section 5.8 _Employee Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) No later than seven days prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver

Employees. From the Closing through the first anniversary of the Closing,
Purchaser shall provide to each Business Employee who remains employed with
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing (each, a "
_Transferred Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Transferred Employees_ ") (
_i_ ) base

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### compensation that is not less than the base compensation paid to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing, ( _ii_ ) annual bonus
opportunities no less favorable than the bonus opportunities provided by
Purchaser to its similarly situated employees immediately prior to the
Closing , and ( _iii_ ) other employee benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the benefits provided by Purchaser to its similarly
situated employees immediately prior to the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (b) Without limiting the generality of anything else contained herein,
Seller shall provide each Business Employee all benefits which have accrued
and, where relevant, vested on behalf of such Business Employee as of the
Closing under, and in accordance with the terms of, the Business Benefit
Plans, and Purchaser shall assume no liability therefor. Other than as a
result of direct rollovers from the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser
401(k) Plan in accordance with _Section 5.8(d)_, there shall be no transfer
of assets or liabilities from any Business Benefit Plan to any Purchaser
Plan.

  

### 

  

### (c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries following the Closing
and in which any Transferred Employee participates (the " _Purchaser Plans_
"), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and

employers to the extent Seller or its Affiliates provide past service credit)
shall be treated as service with Purchaser and/or any applicable Subsidiary
of Purchaser to the extent credited under a corresponding Business Benefit
Plan; _provided_ that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan. Such service
also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or evidence
of insurability requirements. Each Purchaser Plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations for Transferred Employees (and their beneficiaries and
covered dependents) participating in such plan to the extent waived or not
applicable under the applicable Business Benefit Plan. The Transferred
Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Purchaser Plan for
amounts paid prior to the Closing during the Purchaser Plan year in which the
Closing occurs under a corresponding Business Benefit Plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums for such period as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Purchaser Plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) Effective not later than the Closing, Purchaser or its Affiliates
shall have in effect one or more defined contribution plans that include a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k)
of the Code (and a related trust exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the
Code) (as applicable, the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_"). Each
Transferred Employee participating in a Business Benefit Plan that is a

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Seller 401(k) Plan_") immediately prior to the Closing shall become a
participant in the corresponding Purchaser 401(k) Plan as of the Closing and
each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate in a Purchaser
401(k) Plan as of the Closing. Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan to accept a "direct rollover" to such Purchaser 401(k) Plan of the
account balances of each Transferred Employee (including promissory notes
evidencing all outstanding loans) under the Seller 401(k) Plan in which such
Transferred Employee participates, if such direct rollover is elected in
accordance with applicable Law by such Transferred Employee.

### (e) Nothing contained herein, express or implied ( _i_ ) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any Business Benefit Plan, any
Purchaser Plan, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
( _ii_ ) shall alter or limit the ability of Purchaser, Seller, or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Business
Benefit Plan, any Purchaser Plan, or any other benefit plan, program,

such individual or legal representative any rights under or with respect to
any plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated by this
Agreement, and each such individual or legal representative shall be entitled
to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or arrangement
for his or her rights thereunder.

### (f) Seller agrees to notify Purchaser promptly of any layoffs of any
Business Employees in the 90-day period prior to the Closing. Purchaser
agrees, with respect to Business Employees, to provide any required notice
under the Federal Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "
_WARN Act_ ") or any similar Law, and each party agrees to take such actions
as are otherwise necessary to comply with the WARN Act or any such other
similar Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined
in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting Business
Employees (including as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and occurring from and after the Closing;
_provided_ that Purchaser shall bear and be responsible for any liability and
related costs and expenses arising from or relating to any action of
Purchaser or its Affiliates that would cause any termination of employment of
any employees by Seller or its Affiliates that occurs prior to Closing ( _i_
) to constitute a "plant closing", "mass layoff" or group termination or

  



        
   

  

###

create any liability or penalty to Seller or its Affiliates for any
employment terminations under applicable Law.

reasonably cooperate in such matters as are reasonably necessary to effect
the transactions contemplated by this _Section 5.8_, including the exchange
of information relating to workers compensation and employee benefits.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.9 _Permits and Deferred Assets_.  From and after the date hereof
and until Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain any local permits and
any consent, authorization, approval or similar item from any non-
governmental Third Party or from any Governmental Authority that is acting
solely as a landlord or that is the issuer of any local permit, in either
case, that is required or appropriate as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the transfer of any
Transferred Asset remains subject to receipt of any such required local
permit or consent, authorization, approval or similar item at Closing, Seller
will not cause the Contributing Entities to transfer such asset (each such
asset, a " _Deferred Asset_ ") to Newco at or prior to Closing. With respect
to any Deferred Asset, for a period commencing as of the Closing and ending
12 months following the Closing, Seller will continue to use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain such permit, consent, authorization, approval or
similar item and, to the extent possible, will provide Newco with the
economic benefits and burdens (which burdens Purchaser shall cause Newco to
assume, and which Purchaser agrees to guaranty, for so long as Newco enjoys
such economic benefits) of such Deferred Asset, until such permit, consent,
authorization, approval or similar item is obtained; _provided_ , however,
that in no event shall Seller, Newco or Purchaser be required under this
provision to ( _x_ ) agree to any amendment, renewal or extension of any
lease or other agreement, obligation or arrangement that is or is related to
any Deferred Asset or ( _y_ ) make any payment or incur any out-of-pocket
cost, other than in de minimis amounts or as required under the terms of any
existing agreement governing the relevant Contributing Entitys interest in
such Deferred Asset.

## Section 5.10 _Notifications_.  From and after the date hereof until the
Closing Date, each party shall promptly notify the other party of the
occurrence of any breach by such party of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that is reasonably likely
to make the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in _Article VI_
impossible or unlikely.

a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to any other Person with respect to
such information; ( _y_ ) is required to be disclosed by Seller, Purchaser

conducted by the Contributing Entities in the Market or Cluster that is the
subject thereof shall cease to be part of the Business, ( _ii_ ) the

transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise _is not_ a condition precedent
to Purchasers obligation to close the transactions contemplated hereby.)

  

### 

  

(b) Without limiting the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from and
after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, provide to Purchaser and its Affiliates such assistance and

## 

  

## Section 5.17 _Third Party Rights_.

right in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
as to which the parties believe such a right might be asserted (regardless of
whether they believe there is a reasonable basis for such assertion) (each
such value, a " _Tag-Along Value_ "). Any Transferred Assets to be acquired by
a Third Party pursuant to a Third Party Right that is exercised or as to
which notice of exercise is provided to Seller prior to Closing shall cease

"tag-along" or similar right under any agreement set forth on _Schedule
5.17(a)_ , Purchaser shall enter into a purchase agreement with such Tag-
Along Seller, which shall be on the terms required by such right, pursuant to
which Purchaser shall purchase from such Tag-Along Seller the asset that such
Tag-Along Seller is entitled to sell to Purchaser pursuant to such right at a
price equal to the Tag-Along Value for such asset (a " _Tag-Along Purchase_
").

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### Any Tag-Along Purchase shall be subject to any regulatory approvals
required in connection with such Tag-Along Purchase, the filings for which
shall be made by Purchaser and the Tag-Along Seller, and shall, unless
requested by Seller, be separate from any applications, notices or other
filings that are otherwise made in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.  Purchasers obligation to close any Tag-Along Purchase
shall be conditioned on the Closing, but the Closing shall not be conditioned
on the closing of any Tag-Along Purchase. Any Tag-Along Seller of an
interest in Ohio RSA #3 Limited Partnership shall be a third party
beneficiary of this _Section 5.17(c)_ with respect to the sale of such
interest to Purchaser.

## Section 8.5 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge that
their obligations hereunder are unique and that, prior to Closing, remedies
at law, including monetary damages, will be inadequate in the event either
party should default in the

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## performance of its obligations under this Agreement.  Accordingly, but
subject to the requirements of the Governing Regulatory Documents, in the
event of any such breach or threatened breach at or prior to Closing, the
non-defaulting party shall be entitled to a decree of specific performance
pursuant to which the defaulting party is ordered to affirmatively carry out
its pre-Closing or Closing-related, as the case may be, obligations under
this Agreement, and such defaulting party hereby waives any defense to the
effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for such breach
or threatened breach. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any
bond with such equitable remedy are hereby waived. The foregoing shall not
be deemed to be or construed as a waiver or election of remedies by either
party, both of whom expressly reserve any and all rights and remedies
available to it at law or in equity in the event of any breach or default by
the other party under this Agreement prior to Closing.

  

## 

  

## Section 8.6 _Miscellaneous_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Amendment; Waiver; Severability; Entire Agreement_. No
amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement shall be valid or
binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by both parties, and no
waiver hereunder shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and
duly executed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought.
Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific
matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the
party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The
waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of
the provisions of this Agreement, on one or more occasion, shall not be
construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, and
the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasion, to enforce any of
the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege
hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of any of such provisions,
rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are
cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies
that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity. To the extent that any
provision herein is deemed to be unenforceable or contrary to applicable Law,
the parties shall amend the terms hereof to the extent required by such Law.
This Agreement, together with the Schedules, the Transition Services
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Sections 2.5(f)_ ,  _5.3_ ,
_5.14_ and _8.6(d)_ and except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by the
parties, all legal and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such costs and expenses.

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### (c) _Third Parties_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
legal representatives, successors and assigns and they shall not be construed
as conferring any rights or remedies on any other Persons, except as
contemplated by _Section 5.17(c)_.  Notwithstanding that Seller is a
general partnership, no current or future partner of Seller shall have any
liability in connection with this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser shall bear the expense of all use, sales,
transfer and other similar transaction taxes, if any, imposed by reason of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither
party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other party; _provided_ that each of Seller and Purchaser may, without the
consent of the other party, but subject to any necessary approval from a
Governmental Authority, assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder to any
Affiliate thereof prior to or after the Closing, but no assignment described
in this sentence shall relieve the assignor of its obligations hereunder.
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Disclosure Schedules_. Each party may, from time to time prior
to the Closing, and solely for the purposes of rendering their
respective representations and warranties in _Articles III_ and _IV_ true
and correct on and as of the date of the Closing, by written notice in
accordance with this Agreement, supplement, amend or update the Disclosure
Schedules delivered concurrently herewith by such party to correct,
supplement or update in writing any matter which constituted upon execution
and delivery of this Agreement or would constitute as of the Closing Date a
breach of any representation and warranty contained herein; _provided_ , that
any such supplement shall not be effective for purposes of establishing the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Sections 6.1(b)_ and _6.2(b)_
insofar as such conditions relate to the truth and accuracy of the
representations and warranties of either party as of the date of this
Agreement. Any item disclosed by either party in any Schedule hereto, or in
any supplement, amendment or update to the Disclosure Schedules hereto
pursuant to the preceding sentence, shall be deemed to be disclosed for the
purposes of and shall qualify each representation and warranty to which such
item or its contents would be reasonably apparent to relate without regard to
whether the Schedule, supplement, amendment or update specifically references
such representation or warranty and without regard to whether such
representation and warranty specifically references a Schedule or was
qualified by a Schedule prior to such supplement, amendment or update. No
disclosure on any Schedule shall be deemed an admission as to the materiality
of any item so disclosed.

### (h) _Survival_. The respective representations and warranties made, and
covenants or agreements to be performed or complied with at or prior to the
Closing, by Seller and Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall expire at
the Closing, and no party shall have any liability in connection with any
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement following the Closing.
