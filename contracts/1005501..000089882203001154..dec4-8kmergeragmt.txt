2.2      Filing; Plan of Merger
         ----------------------

     The Merger shall not become effective unless this Agreement and the Plan of
Merger are duly  approved  by  shareholders  holding at least a majority  of the

and the Florida  Department  of State,  as  provided in Section  55-11-05 of the
NCBCA and  Section  607.1105  of the FBCA,  respectively.  The Plan of Merger is
incorporated  herein by reference,  and adoption of this Agreement by the Boards

     The  closing  of the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  (the
"Closing")  shall take place at the offices of Womble Carlyle  Sandridge & Rice,

which date shall be no later than:  (i) the fifth  Business  Day of the calendar
month immediately following the calendar month in which the shareholders approve
this  Agreement  and the Plan of Merger;  (ii) if the  conditions to Closing set
forth in Article VI (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other
instruments  and  documents to be delivered at the Closing) are not satisfied on
the date set forth in 2.4(i), the date of Closing shall be no less than five (5)

instruments  and documents to be delivered at the Closing);  or (iii) such later
date as the parties may otherwise agree (the "Closing Date").

2.5      Effect of Merger
         ----------------

     From and after the Effective Time, the separate existence of Republic shall
cease,  and the Surviving  Corporation  shall thereupon and  thereafter,  to the
extent consistent with its Articles of Incorporation, possess all of the rights,
privileges,  immunities and franchises, of a public as well as a private nature,
of each of the Constituent  Corporations;  and all property,  real, personal and
mixed,  and all debts due on whatever  account,  and all other choses in action,
and each and  every  other  interest  of or  belonging  to or due to each



                                       8
<PAGE>

     of the Constituent Corporations shall be taken and deemed to be transferred
to and vested in the Surviving  Corporation without further act or deed; and the
title to any real  estate  or any  interest  therein  vested  in  either  of the
Constituent Corporations shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of
the Merger.  The Surviving  Corporation shall thenceforth be responsible for all
the   liabilities,   obligations  and  penalties  of  each  of  the  Constituent
Corporations;  and any claim, existing action or proceeding,  civil or criminal,
pending by or against either of the Constituent  Corporations  may be prosecuted
as if the  Merger  had not taken  place,  or the  Surviving  Corporation  may be
substituted  in its  place;  and any  judgment  rendered  against  either of the
Constituent  Corporations  may be enforced  against the  Surviving  Corporation.
Neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon the property of either of the
Constituent Corporations shall be impaired by reason of the Merger.

2.6      Further Assurances
         ------------------

     If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation  shall
consider or be advised that any further deeds,  assignments or assurances in law
or any other  actions are  necessary,  desirable  or proper to vest,  perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise,  in the Surviving Corporation,  the title to any
property or rights of the Constituent Corporations acquired or to be acquired by
reason of, or as a result of, the Merger,  the  Constituent  Corporations  agree
that such Constituent Corporations and their proper officers and directors shall
and will execute and deliver all such proper deeds,  assignments  and assurances
in law and do all  things  necessary,  desirable  or proper to vest,  perfect or
confirm  title to such  property  or rights  in the  Surviving  Corporation  and
otherwise  to carry  out the  purpose  of this  Agreement,  and that the  proper
officers and directors of the Surviving  Corporation  are fully  authorized  and
directed in the name of the  Constituent  Corporations  or otherwise to take any
and all such actions.

2.7      Merger Consideration
         --------------------

     (a) As used herein,  the term "Merger  Consideration" per share of Republic
Common Stock shall mean the  consideration  described  in (i) or (ii) below,  as
elected as provided in Section 2.8 by each Republic shareholder,  and subject to
adjustment as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 2.7:

          (i) .81 (the  "Exchange  Ratio")  shares of BB&T Common  Stock (to the
     nearest  ten  thousandth  of a share)  to be  exchanged  for each  share of
     Republic Common Stock subject to this election and owned by the shareholder
     as of the Effective Time (the "Stock Election"); or

          (ii) $31.79 in cash for each share of Republic Common Stock subject to
     this election and owned by the  shareholder  as of the Effective  Time (the
     "Cash Election").


                                       9
<PAGE>


Each  Republic  shareholder  shall be permitted to make any  combination  of the
Stock Election and the Cash Election in whole share  increments  with respect to
the shareholder's shares of Republic Common Stock.

     (b) Notwithstanding  paragraph (a) preceding,  in no event shall the amount
of cash payable  pursuant to the aggregate of the Cash Elections and pursuant to
Section 2.7(c) (the "Aggregate Cash Amount") exceed the lesser of (i) 55% of the
value of the aggregate Merger Consideration  (including cash payable pursuant to
Section  2.7(c)),  determined  by  valuing  shares of BB&T  Common  Stock at the
Closing Value, or (ii) the product of $12.72  multiplied by the number of shares
of Republic  Common  Stock  outstanding  at the close of business on the Closing
Date (the lesser of such amounts  being  referred to herein as the "Maximum Cash
Amount").  In the event that the Aggregate  Cash Amount shall exceed the Maximum
Cash Amount, the Merger Consideration distributable to each Republic shareholder
shall be adjusted by taking the  following  steps:  (1)  determine the amount by
which the Aggregate  Cash Amount  exceeds the Maximum Cash Amount;  (2) allocate
the  excess  amount in (1)  among  all  Republic  shareholders  making  the Cash
Election  in the  proportion  that the amount of cash  payable to each  Republic
shareholder pursuant to the election under Section 2.8 (without giving effect to
any  reduction  pursuant to this Section  2.7(b))  bears to the  Aggregate  Cash
Amount (the amount  allocated to each  shareholder  is referred to herein as the
"Shareholder  Cash  Excess");  (3)  determine the number of whole shares of BB&T
Common  Stock  having  a  value  (valued  at  $39.25  per  share)  equal  to the
Shareholder  Cash Excess (if the Shareholder Cash Excess is not evenly divisible
by $39.25,  the number of shares  determined  by dividing the  Shareholder  Cash
Excess by $39.25 shall be rounded up to the next whole  share),  and (4) add the
number of shares of BB&T  Common  Stock in (3) to the  shares,  if any,  of BB&T
Common Stock that the Republic  shareholder  will receive  pursuant to the Stock
Election of such Republic  shareholder  and reduce the amount of cash subject to
the Cash Election of the  shareholder by the value (at $39.25 per share) of such
number of shares of BB&T Common Stock in (3).

     (c) Cash (without  interest) will be payable in exchange for any fractional
share of BB&T Common Stock which would otherwise be  distributable to a Republic
shareholder,  as determined following application of (a) and (b) of this Section
2.7. The amount of cash payable  with  respect to any  fractional  share of BB&T
Common Stock shall be  determined by  multiplying  the  fractional  part of such
share by the Closing  Value.  The "Closing  Value" shall mean the average of the
high and low price per share of BB&T  Common  Stock on the NYSE as  reported  on
NYSEnet.com on the date of the Effective Time (as of 4:00 p.m. eastern time).

2.8      Conversion of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration
         -----------------------------------------------------

     (a) At the  Effective  Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Republic or the holders of record of Republic Common Stock,  each
share of Republic Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately  prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and shall represent the right to receive,
upon surrender of the



                                       10
<PAGE>


     certificate  representing  such share of Republic Common Stock (as provided
in subsection (d) below), the Merger Consideration.

     (b) Each share of BB&T  Common  Stock  issued and  outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and outstanding.

     (c) Until  surrendered,  each  outstanding  certificate  which prior to the
Effective Time  represented one or more shares of Republic Common Stock shall be
deemed upon the Effective  Time for all purposes to represent  only the right to
receive the Merger  Consideration  and any  declared and unpaid  dividends  with
respect to Republic  Common  Stock.  No interest  will be paid or accrued on the
Merger  Consideration  upon the  surrender of the  certificate  or  certificates
representing  shares of Republic  Common Stock.  With respect to any certificate
for Republic  Common Stock that has been lost or  destroyed,  BB&T shall pay the
Merger  Consideration  attributable to such certificate upon receipt of a surety
bond or other adequate  indemnity as required in accordance with BB&T's standard
policy, and evidence reasonably  satisfactory to BB&T of ownership of the shares
represented thereby.  After the Effective Time,  Republic's transfer books shall
be closed and no  transfer of the shares of Republic  Common  Stock  outstanding
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  shall be made on the stock  transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation.

     (d) Promptly after the Effective  Time, BB&T shall cause to be delivered or
mailed  to  each  Republic  shareholder  a form of  letter  of  transmittal  and
instructions  for use in  effecting  the  surrender of the  certificates  which,
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time,  represented  any shares of Republic
Common Stock.  Upon proper  surrender of such  certificates or other evidence of
ownership meeting the requirements of Section 2.8(c),  together with such letter
of transmittal  duly executed and completed in accordance with the  instructions
thereto,  and such other  documents as may be reasonably  requested,  BB&T shall
promptly  cause the  transfer  to the  persons  entitled  thereto  of the Merger
Consideration in the form elected or deemed elected.

     (e)  The   Surviving   Corporation   shall  pay  any   dividends  or  other
distributions  with a record  date  prior to the  Effective  Time that have been
declared or made by Republic  in respect of shares of Republic  Common  Stock in
accordance  with the  terms of this  Agreement  and that  remain  unpaid  at the
Effective Time, subject to compliance by Republic with Section 5.9(b).  Whenever
a dividend or other  distribution  is declared by BB&T on the BB&T Common Stock,
the record date for which is at or after the  Effective  Time,  the  declaration
shall  include  dividends  or other  distributions  on all shares of BB&T Common
Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution
payable to the holders of record of BB&T Common Stock as of any time  subsequent
to the  Effective  Time  shall be  delivered  to the  holder of any  certificate
representing Republic Common Stock until such holder surrenders such certificate
for  exchange  as  provided  in  this  Section  2.8.  Upon   surrender  of  such
certificate,   both  the  Merger   Consideration   (without  interest)  and  any
undelivered  dividends payable hereunder



                                       11
<PAGE>

(without  interest)  shall be delivered and paid with respect to the shares of
Republic Common Stock represented by such certificate.

     (f) Subject to the election and allocation procedures set forth in Sections
2.7 and 2.8,  each record  holder of Republic  Common  Stock as of the  Election
Deadline will be entitled to elect the form of Merger  Consideration  in Section
2.7(a)(i) and (ii). All such elections  shall be made on a form provided by BB&T
for that purpose ("Form of  Election").  BB&T and Republic will mail the Form of
Election on or shortly after the date the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus  is mailed
to the shareholders of Republic.

     (g) Any election for the purposes of Sections 2.7 and 2.8 will be effective
only if BB&T has  received a properly  completed  and signed Form of Election by
the Election Deadline.  The "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m.,  Winston-Salem,
North Carolina Time, on the date of Republic's  shareholders' meeting to vote on
this  Agreement  and the Plan of Merger.  A Form of  Election  may be revoked or
changed by the person  submitting  such Form of Election or any other  person to
whom the subject shares are  subsequently  transferred by written notice by such
person to BB&T at or prior to the Election Deadline.  All Forms of Election will
be deemed to be revoked if this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
its terms.

     (h) Any holder of Republic  Common Stock as of the Effective  Time who does
not submit a properly  completed and signed Form of Election that is received by
BB&T at or prior to the Election Deadline, will be deemed to have made the Stock
Election  in  Section  2.7(a)(i)  for all  purposes  herein.  BB&T will have the
discretion to disregard immaterial defects in Forms of Election.  If BB&T or its
designee  reasonably  determines  that  any  purported  Stock  Election  or Cash
Election was not properly made, such purported  election will be deemed to be of
no force and effect and the holder  making such  election will be deemed to have
made the Stock Election in Section 2.7(a)(i) for all purposes herein.

2.9      Conversion of Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
         ---------------------------------------------------------

     (a) At the Effective Time, each Stock Option and SAR then  outstanding (and
which by its terms does not lapse on or before the Effective  Time),  whether or
not then exercisable,  shall be converted into and become rights with respect to
BB&T Common Stock, and BB&T shall assume each Stock Option and SAR in accordance
with the  terms of the  Stock  Option  Plans,  except  that  from and  after the
Effective Time (i) BB&T and its Compensation  Committee shall be substituted for
Republic and the  Committee  of  Republic's  Board of Directors  with respect to
administering  the Stock Option Plans, (ii) each Stock Option and SAR assumed by
BB&T may be exercised  solely for shares of BB&T Common Stock, or in the case of
an SAR, a cash  payment in respect of the value of shares of BB&T Common  Stock,
(iii) the  number of shares of BB&T  Common  Stock  subject  to each such  Stock
Option and with  respect to each SAR shall be the number of whole shares of BB&T
Common Stock  (omitting any  fractional  share)  determined by  multiplying  the
number of shares of Republic  Common  Stock  subject to such Stock


                                       12
<PAGE>


Option or SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and
(iv) the per share  exercise price under each such Stock Option and SAR shall be
adjusted by dividing the per share  exercise  price under each such Stock Option
and  SAR  by  the  Exchange   Ratio  and  rounding  up  to  the  nearest   cent.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  BB&T may at its election  substitute as of the
Effective Time options or stock  appreciation  rights under the BB&T Corporation
1995 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan or any other duly adopted  comparable plan (in
either case,  the "BB&T Option  Plan") for all or a part of the Stock Options or
SARs,  subject to the following  conditions:  (A) the  requirements of (iii) and
(iv)  above  shall  be  met;  (B)  such  substitution  shall  not  constitute  a
modification, extension or renewal of any of the Stock Options or SARs and shall
be tax neutral to the option holder;  and (C) the  substituted  options or stock
appreciation rights shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as
provided  in the Stock  Option or SAR  agreements  and the  Stock  Option  Plans
governing  each Stock Option and SAR. BB&T shall cause each grant of a converted
or  substitute  option  or  stock  appreciation  right  to  any  individual  who
subsequent  to the  Merger  will be a director  or officer of BB&T as  construed
under  Commission  Rule 16b-3 (a  "Continuing  Insider") to be duly  approved in
accordance with the provisions of Rule 16b-3 such that the receipt thereof shall
be exempt from Section  16(b) of the  Exchange  Act (BB&T and Republic  agreeing
that, in order to most effectively  compensate and retain Continuing Insiders in
connection  with the Merger,  both prior to and after the Effective  Time, it is
desirable that  Continuing  Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent  permitted by applicable
law as a result of any deemed  purchase or sale for  purposes  of Section  16(b)
arising in connection with the exchange and/or  conversion of shares of Republic
Common Stock and Stock Options and SARs in the Merger).  Each Stock Option which
is an incentive stock option shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the
Code,  and the  Regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  so as to  continue  as an
incentive  stock  option  under  Section  424(a) of the  Code,  and so as not to
constitute  a  modification,  extension,  or renewal  of the  option  within the
meaning  of  Section  424(h) of the Code.  BB&T and  Republic  agree to take all
necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9. BB&T
has reserved and shall continue to reserve  adequate shares of BB&T Common Stock
for delivery  upon  exercise of any  converted  or  substitute  options.  Within
fifteen days after the Effective Time, if it has not already done so, BB&T shall
file a  registration  statement  on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or
any successor or other  appropriate  forms),  with respect to the shares of BB&T
Common Stock subject to converted or substitute  options and shall  maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of
the prospectus or prospectuses  contained therein) for so long as such converted
or substitute options remain outstanding.  With respect to those individuals, if
any, who  subsequent to the Merger may be subject to the reporting  requirements
under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, BB&T shall  administer the Stock Option
Plans  assumed  pursuant  to this  Section  2.9 (or the  BB&T  Option  Plan,  if
applicable)  in a manner that  complies  with Rule 16b-3  promulgated  under the
Exchange  Act to the extent  necessary  to  preserve  for such  individuals  the
benefits of Rule 16b-3 to the extent such benefits were  available to them prior
to the Effective Time. Republic hereby represents that the Stock


                                       13
<PAGE>

Option Plans in their current forms have been  administered  in compliance  with
Rule 16b-3 to the extent, if any, required as of the date hereof.

     (b) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, BB&T shall deliver
to the participants  receiving  converted options or stock appreciation  rights
under  the  BB&T  Option  Plan  an   appropriate   notice   setting  forth  such
participant's rights pursuant thereto.

     (c) Eligibility to receive new stock option grants  following the Effective
Time with respect to BB&T Common Stock shall be determined by BB&T in accordance
with its plans and procedures as in effect from time to time, and subject to any
contractual obligations.

2.10     Merger of Subsidiaries
         ----------------------

     In the event that BB&T shall request, Republic shall take such actions, and
shall cause the Republic  Subsidiaries to take such actions,  as may be required
in order to effect,  immediately  after the Effective Time, the merger of one or
more of the Republic  Subsidiaries  with and into, in each case, one of the BB&T
Subsidiaries;  provided, however, that such actions, merger or mergers shall not
(i)  impose  any  significant  additional  costs  on  Republic  or the  Republic
Subsidiaries or (ii) impede or materially delay consummation of the Merger.

2.11     Anti-Dilution
         -------------

     In the event BB&T  changes the number of shares of BB&T Common Stock issued
and  outstanding  at  or  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  as a  result  of  any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend or other similar
event,  and the record  date  thereof (in the case of a stock  dividend)  or the
effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar recapitalization
for  which a  record  date  is not  established)  shall  be at or  prior  to the
Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.

                                   ARTICLE III
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF REPUBLIC

     Except as Disclosed,  Republic  represents  and warrants to BB&T as follows
(the  representations  and warranties herein of Republic are made subject to the
applicable  standard set forth in Section 6.3(a), and no such  representation or
warranty shall be deemed to be inaccurate or incomplete  unless it is inaccurate
or  incomplete to the extent that BB&T would be entitled to refuse to consummate
the Merger pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) on account of such inaccuracy):

3.1      Capital Structure
         -----------------

     The authorized  capital stock of Republic  consists of 20,000,000 shares of
Republic Common Stock and 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $20.00 par
value,  of Republic  ("Republic  Preferred  Stock").  As of September  30, 2003,
Republic had 13,267,294  shares of Republic  Common Stock issued and outstanding
and no shares of Republic Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. Except for the
foregoing and as permitted by Section 5.9(c),  no other classes of capital stock
of Republic,  common or preferred,  are authorized,  issued or outstanding.  All
outstanding  shares of Republic  capital stock have been duly authorized and are
validly issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable.  No shares of capital stock have
been  reserved  for any  purpose,  except for shares of  Republic  Common  Stock
reserved in connection  with the Stock Option  Plans.  As of September 30, 2003,
Republic had  outstanding  options to acquire  736,590 shares of Republic Common
Stock under the Stock Option Plans or other  outstanding  agreements and awards.
Except as set forth in this Section 3.1, there are no Rights authorized,  issued
or outstanding with respect to, nor are there any agreements,  understandings or
commitments  with  Republic  or its  Subsidiaries  relating  to the right of any
Republic  shareholder  to own, to vote or to dispose  of, the  capital  stock of
Republic.  Holders of Republic Common Stock do not have preemptive rights. As of
September 30, 2003,  Republic had outstanding  SARs under the Stock Option Plans
or other  outstanding  agreements  and awards with  respect to 11,340  shares of
Republic Common Stock which SARs were exercisable solely for a cash payment.

that would prevent or interfere with the continuation of such compliance.

     (b) There are no pending  Environmental  Claims,  neither  Republic nor any
Republic Subsidiary has received notice of any pending Environmental Claims, and
there are no conditions or facts existing which might  reasonably be expected to

investigations  of any nature  seeking to  impose,  or that could  result in the
imposition  of, any  liability  arising  under any  Environmental  Laws upon (i)
Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary,  (ii) any person or entity whose liability
for any Environmental  Claim Republic or any Republic Subsidiary has or may have
retained or assumed, either contractually or by operation of law, (iii) any real

could result in the imposition of any liability  arising under any Environmental
Laws,  against  Republic  or any  Republic  Subsidiary  or against any person or
entity whose  liability  for any  Environmental  Claim  Republic or any Republic

transactions  on the books of Republic and the Republic  Subsidiaries  are valid
and properly  documented and were made in the ordinary  course of business,  and
the  security  therefor,  if any, is valid and properly  perfected.  Neither the
terms of such  loans,  leases,  installment  sales  contracts  and other  credit
transactions, nor any of the documentation evidencing such transactions, nor the
manner in which such loans, leases, installment sales contracts and other credit
transactions have been administered and serviced,  nor Republic's procedures and
practices of approving or rejecting applications for such transactions, violates

all federal, state and local (and, if applicable,  foreign) tax returns required
by applicable law to be filed by them (including, without limitation,  estimated

employment  tax returns) and have paid, or have set up a reserve or accrual that
is adequate  under GAAP for the payment of, all taxes shown as due in respect of

and its records  contain  all  information  and  documents  (including  properly
completed IRS Forms W-9) necessary to comply with,  all  applicable  information
reporting and tax withholding  requirements under federal,  state, and local tax
laws, and such records  identify with specificity all accounts subject to backup
withholding under Section 3406 of the Code.

     (f) Neither  Republic  nor any of the  Republic  Subsidiaries  has made any
payments,  is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any contract that

3.14     Employees; Compensation; Benefit Plans
         --------------------------------------

     (a)  Compensation.  Republic  has  previously  made  available  information

     (b) Employee Benefit Plans.

          (i) Republic has Disclosed an accurate and complete list of all Plans,
     as defined below,  contributed  to,  maintained or sponsored by Republic or
     any Republic Subsidiary, or to which Republic or any Republic Subsidiary is
     obligated to contribute  for the benefit of current or former  employees of
     Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary.  For purposes of this Agreement,  the
     term "Plan" shall mean a plan, arrangement,  agreement or program described
     in the  foregoing  provisions  of this  Section  3.14(b)(i)  that is: (A) a
     profit-sharing, deferred compensation, bonus, stock option, stock purchase,
     pension, retainer, consulting,  retirement, severance, welfare or incentive
     plan,  agreement or  arrangement,  whether or not funded and whether or not
     terminated (only if such plan has assets or liabilities), (B) an employment
     agreement,  (C) a personnel policy or fringe benefit plan, policy,  program
     or  arrangement  providing for benefits or perquisites to current or


                                       21
<PAGE>


     former employees, officers, directors or agents, whether or not funded, and
     whether or not  terminated  (only if such plan has assets or  liabilities),
     including,  without  limitation,  benefits relating to automobiles,  clubs,
     vacation,  child  care,  parenting,   sabbatical,  sick  leave,  severance,
     medical,  dental,  hospitalization,  life  insurance  and  other  types  of
     insurance,  or (D) any other  employee  benefit  plan as defined in Section
     3(3) of ERISA, whether or not funded and whether or not terminated.

          (ii) Neither Republic nor any Republic Subsidiary  contributes to, has
     an  obligation to contribute to or otherwise has any liability or potential
     liability with respect to (A) any multiemployer  plan as defined in Section
     3(37) of ERISA,  (B) any plan of the type  described  in Sections  4063 and
     4064 of ERISA or in Section  413 of the Code (and  regulations  promulgated
     thereunder),  or (C)  any  plan  which  provides  health,  life  insurance,
     accident or other "welfare-type"  benefits to current or future retirees or
     former employees or directors,  their spouses or dependents,  other than in
     accordance with Section 4980B of the Code or applicable state  continuation
     coverage law.

          (iii) None of the Plans obligates Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary
     to pay separation,  severance,  termination or similar-type benefits solely
     as a result of any transaction  contemplated by this Agreement or solely as
     a result of a "change in  control," as such term is used in Section 280G of
     the Code (and regulations promulgated thereunder).

          (iv) Each Plan, and all related trusts, insurance contracts and funds,
     has been maintained,  funded and administered in compliance in all respects
     with its own terms and in compliance  in all respects  with all  applicable
     laws and  regulations,  including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. No
     actions,  suits,  claims,  complaints,   charges,  proceedings,   hearings,
     examinations,  investigations,  audits or demands with respect to the Plans
     (other than routine  claims for  benefits) are pending or  threatened,  and
     there are no facts  which could give rise to or be expected to give rise to
     any actions, suits, claims,  complaints,  charges,  proceedings,  hearings,
     examinations, investigations, audits or demands. No Plan that is subject to
     the funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA
     has incurred any "accumulated  funding  deficiency" as such term is defined
     in such  Sections of ERISA and the Code,  whether or not  waived,  and each
     Plan has always satisfied the funding  standards  required under Title I of
     ERISA and  Section 412 of the Code.  No  liability  to the Pension  Benefit
     Guaranty  Corporation ("PBGC") (except for routine payment of premiums) has
     been or is reasonably expected to be incurred with respect to any Plan that
     is  subject  to Title IV of  ERISA,  no  reportable  event (as such term is
     defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the PBGC has not waived  notice
     has occurred with respect to any such Plan,  and the PBGC has not commenced
     or threatened the  termination of any Plan.  None of the assets of Republic
     or any Republic Subsidiary is the subject of any lien arising under Section
     302(f) of ERISA or Section  412(n) of the Code,


                                       22
<PAGE>


     neither Republic nor any Republic  Subsidiary has been required to post any
     security  pursuant  to Section  307 of ERISA or Section  401(a)(29)  of the
     Code,  and there are no facts  which could  reasonably  be expected to give
     rise to such lien or such posting of security. No event has occurred and no
     condition exists that would subject Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary to
     any tax under Sections 4971,  4972,  4976, 4977 or 4979 of the Code or to a
     fine or penalty under Section 502(c) of ERISA.

          (v) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
     the Code,  and each trust (if any) forming a part  thereof,  has received a
     favorable  determination  letter from the IRS as to the qualification under
     the Code of such Plan and the tax exempt status of such related trust,  and
     nothing has occurred since the date of such determination letter that could
     adversely affect the qualification of such Plan or the tax exempt status of
     such related trust.

          (vi) No underfunded "defined benefit plan" (as such term is defined in
     Section  3(35) of ERISA)  has been,  during the five  years  preceding  the
     Closing  Date,  transferred  out of the  controlled  group of  corporations
     (within the meaning of Sections  414(b),  (c),  (m) and (o) of the Code) of
     which  Republic  or any  Republic  Subsidiary  is a member  or was a member
     during  such  five-year  period.  There  does  not  now  exist,  nor do any
     circumstances  exist,  that would result in, any liability  with respect to
     any employee  benefit plan that is maintained,  sponsored or contributed to
     by any  entity  that  is a  member  of the  Republic  controlled  group  of
     corporations  (as defined  above) (i) under  Title IV of ERISA,  (ii) under
     section 302 of ERISA,  (iii) under  sections  412 and 4971 of the Code,  or
     (iv) as a result of a  failure  to comply  with the  continuation  coverage
     requirements of section 601 et seq. of ERISA and section 4980B of the Code,
     or (v) under any other statute, rule or regulation that would reasonably be
     expected to be a liability of Republic or a Republic Subsidiary solely as a
     result of an  entity  being a member of the  Republic  controlled  group of
     corporations  (as defined above),  that would be a liability of Republic or
     any Republic Subsidiary,  other than such liabilities that arise solely out
     of, or relate  solely to,  the Plans  Disclosed  in Section  3.14(b) of the
     Republic Disclosure Memorandum.

          (vii) As of December 31, 2002,  the fair market value of the assets of
     each Plan that is a tax qualified defined benefit plan equaled or exceeded,
     and as of the Closing Date will equal or exceed,  the present  value of all
     vested and nonvested  liabilities  thereunder determined in accordance with
     the actuarial  methods,  factors and  assumptions  contained in such Plan's
     most recent actuarial valuation,  which such actuarial methods, factors and
     assumptions are reasonable as of the date of such actuarial valuation. With
     respect to each Plan that is subject to the funding requirements of Section
     412 of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA,  all required  contributions  for
     all periods  ending prior to or as of the Closing Date  (including  periods
     from the first day of the  then-current  plan year to the Closing  Date and
     including all quarterly  contributions  required in accordance


                                       23
<PAGE>

     with Section 412(m) of the Code) shall have been made. With respect to each
     other Plan, all required payments, premiums, contributions,  reimbursements
     or accruals for all periods ending prior to or as of the Closing Date shall
     have been made. No tax qualified Plan has any unfunded liabilities.

          (viii) No  prohibited  transaction  (which shall mean any  transaction
     prohibited  by Section  406 of ERISA and not exempt  under  Section  408 of
     ERISA  or  Section  4975  of the  Code,  whether  by  statutory,  class  or
     individual  exemption)  has  occurred  with respect to any Plan which would
     result in the  imposition,  directly  or  indirectly,  of any  excise  tax,
     penalty or other liability under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 409 or
     502(i) of ERISA.  Neither  Republic nor, to the best knowledge of Republic,
     any Republic Subsidiary,  any trustee,  administrator or other fiduciary of
     any  Plan,  or  any  agent  of  any of the  foregoing  has  engaged  in any
     transaction  or  acted or  failed  to act in a manner  that  could  subject
     Republic  or  any  Republic  Subsidiary  to any  liability  for  breach  of
     fiduciary duty under ERISA.

          (ix) With respect to each Plan, all reports and  information  required
     to be filed with any government  agency or distributed to Plan participants
     and their beneficiaries have been duly and timely filed or distributed.

          (x) Republic and each Republic Subsidiary has been and is presently in
     compliance with all of the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code.

          (xi) Neither  Republic nor any Republic  Subsidiary has a liability as
     of  December  31,  2002 under any Plan that,  to the extent  disclosure  is
     required  under GAAP,  is not reflected on the  consolidated  balance sheet
     included in the  Financial  Statements of Republic as of December 31, 2002,
     or any  Financial  Statements  of  Republic  as of a later  date  that  are
     contained  in  Securities  Documents  of  Republic  filed prior to the date
     hereof or otherwise Disclosed.

          (xii) Neither the consideration nor implementation of the transactions
     contemplated  under this  Agreement  will  increase (A)  Republic's  or any
     Republic  Subsidiary's  obligation  to  make  contributions  or  any  other
     payments to fund  benefits  accrued  under the Plans as of the date of this
     Agreement  or (B) the  benefits  accrued  or  payable  with  respect to any
     participant  under the Plans  (except to the extent  benefits may be deemed
     increased by  accelerated  vesting,  accelerated  allocation  of previously
     unallocated  Plan assets or by the  conversion  of stock options or SARs in
     accordance with Section 2.9).

          (xiii)  With  respect to each Plan,  Republic  has  Disclosed  or made
     available to BB&T,  true,  complete and correct copies of (A) all documents
     pursuant  to which the  Plans  are  maintained,  funded  and  administered,
     including  summary  plan  descriptions,  (B) the three most  recent  annual

     limitation,  excise tax returns and reportable events filings,  and (F) all
     governmental  rulings,  determinations,  and opinions (and pending requests
     for  governmental  rulings,  determinations,  and opinions) during the past
     three years.

          (xiv)  Each of the  Plans as  applied  to  Republic  and any  Republic
     Subsidiary may be amended or terminated at any time by action of Republic's
     Board of Directors,  or such Republic's Subsidiary's Board of Directors, as
     the  case  may be,  or a  committee  of such  Board  of  Directors  or duly
     authorized  officer,  in each  case  subject  to the  terms of the Plan and
     compliance with applicable laws and regulations  (and limited,  in the case
     of multiemployer  plans, to termination of the participation of Republic or
     a Republic Subsidiary thereunder).

3.15     Certain Contracts
         -----------------

     (a) Neither Republic nor any Republic Subsidiary is a party to, is bound or
affected  by, or  receives  benefits  under (i) except for this  Agreement,  any
agreement,  arrangement or commitment, written or oral, the default of which has
had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect,  whether or
not  made  in the  ordinary  course  of  business  (other  than  loans  or  loan
commitments made or certificates or deposits  received in the ordinary course of
the  banking  business),  outstanding  on the  date  hereof,  or  any  agreement
restricting in any material respect its business activities,  including, without
limitation,   agreements   or  memoranda  of   understanding   with   regulatory
authorities, (ii) any agreement, indenture or other instrument, written or oral,
outstanding  on the date hereof,  relating to the borrowing of money by Republic
or any  Republic  Subsidiary  or  the  guarantee  by  Republic  or any  Republic
Subsidiary of any such obligation,  which cannot be terminated  within less than
30 days after the Closing Date by Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary  (without
payment of any penalty or cost, except with respect to Federal Home Loan Bank or
Federal Reserve Bank advances), (iii) any agreement,  arrangement or commitment,
written  or  oral,  relating  to the  employment  of a  consultant,  independent
contractor or agent, or the  employment,  election or retention in office of any
present or former  director or officer,  which cannot be terminated  within less

contingent,  or the  application  of which is altered,  upon the occurrence of a
transaction involving Republic of the nature contemplated by this Agreement,  or
(iv) any agreement or plan,  written or oral,  including any stock option plans,
stock  appreciation  rights plan,  restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan,
any of the benefits of which will be  increased,  or the vesting of the benefits
of which  will be  accelerated,  by the  occurrence  of any of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will
be  calculated  on the  basis of any of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement. Each agreement, arrangement, commitment, indenture and plan Disclosed

Republic or its applicable Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of Republic, against
the other parties thereto.

<PAGE>

     (b) Neither  Republic nor any Republic  Subsidiary  is in default under any
agreement,   commitment,   arrangement,   lease,   insurance  policy,  or  other
instrument, whether entered into in the ordinary course of business or otherwise
and whether written or oral, and there has not occurred any event that, with the
lapse of time or giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default.

3.16     Legal Proceedings; Regulatory Approvals
         ---------------------------------------

     There  are  no  actions,  suits,  claims,  governmental  investigations  or
proceedings  instituted,   pending  or,  to  the  best  knowledge  of  Republic,
threatened  against  Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary  or against any asset,
interest, Plan or right of Republic or any Republic Subsidiary,  or, to the best
knowledge of Republic,  against any officer, director or employee of any of them
in  their  capacity  as  such.  There  are  no  actions,  suits  or  proceedings
instituted,  pending or, to the best knowledge of Republic,  threatened  against
any present or former director or officer of Republic or any Republic Subsidiary
that would  reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim  against  Republic or
any Republic Subsidiary for indemnification. There are no actual or, to the best
knowledge of Republic,  threatened actions, suits or proceedings which present a
claim to restrain or prohibit the transactions  contemplated herein. To the best
knowledge of Republic, no fact or condition relating to Republic or any Republic
Subsidiary exists (including, without limitation,  noncompliance with the CRA or
the USA PATRIOT ACT) that would prevent  Republic or BB&T from  obtaining all of
the federal and state regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger.

3.17     Compliance with Laws; Filings
         -----------------------------

     Each of Republic and each Republic  Subsidiary  is in  compliance  with all
statutes and regulations  (including,  but not limited to, the Securities  Laws,
the CRA, the TILA and rules and regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  and other
consumer  banking laws),  and has obtained and maintained all permits,  licenses
and  registrations  necessary  to the  conduct  of  its  business  as  presently
conducted,  and since  December  31,  2000  neither  Republic  nor any  Republic
Subsidiary  has received  notification  that has not lapsed,  been  withdrawn or
abandoned by any agency or department of federal,  state or local government (i)
asserting a violation or possible  violation of any such statute or  regulation,
(ii)  threatening  to  revoke  any  permit,  license,   registration,  or  other
government  authorization,  or  (iii)  restricting  or in any way  limiting  its
operations (other than general regulatory  restrictions  applicable to similarly
situated banks and bank holding companies  generally).  Neither Republic nor any
Republic Subsidiary is subject to any regulatory or supervisory cease and desist
order,  agreement,  directive,  memorandum of understanding  or commitment,  and
since December 31, 2000 none of them has received any  communication  requesting
that it enter into any of the foregoing.  Since December 31, 2000,  Republic and
each of the Republic Subsidiaries has filed all reports, registrations,  notices
and statements,  and any amendments  thereto,  that it was required to file with
federal and state regulatory  authorities,  including,  without limitation,  the
Commission,  FDIC,  Federal Reserve Board and applicable state regulators.  Each
such report,


                                       26

Republic or any  Republic  Subsidiary  has  purchased  securities  subject to an
agreement to resell,  Republic or the Republic Subsidiary has a valid, perfected
first lien or security  interest in the securities or other collateral  securing
such agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of
the debt secured thereby.  With respect to all agreements currently  outstanding
pursuant  to which  Republic  or any  Republic  Subsidiary  has sold  securities
subject  to an  agreement  to  repurchase,  neither  Republic  nor the  Republic
Subsidiary  has pledged  collateral  having a value at the time of entering into
such  pledge  that  exceeds  the  amount of the debt  secured  thereby.  Neither
Republic nor any Republic  Subsidiary has pledged  collateral  having a value at
the time of entering into such pledge that exceeds the amount required under any
interest rate swap or other similar agreement currently outstanding.

     (b)  Neither  Republic  nor any  Republic  Subsidiary  is a party to or has
agreed to enter  into an  exchange-traded  or  over-the-counter  swap,  forward,
future,  option, cap, floor, or collar financial contract, or any other interest
rate or foreign currency  protection contract not included on its balance sheets
in the Financial Statements, which is a financial derivative contract (including
various combinations  thereof),  except for options and forwards entered into in
the  ordinary  course of its  mortgage  lending  business  consistent  with past
practice and current policy.

institutions  are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by federal
law,  and the  Republic  Subsidiaries  have paid all  premiums  and  assessments
required to have been paid,  and filed all reports  required to have been filed,
under all rules and regulations applicable to the FDIC.

         --------------------------

     Republic has Disclosed all existing  transactions,  investments  and loans,

any Republic  Subsidiary is a party with any director,  executive  officer or 5%
shareholder of Republic or any person,  corporation,  or enterprise controlling,
controlled  by or  under  common  control  with any of the  foregoing.  All such
transactions,  investments  and loans are on terms no less favorable to Republic

         -------------------

         --------------------------

     Neither  Republic nor any Republic  Subsidiary  has taken or agreed to take
any  action or knows of any  circumstance  which  would or could  reasonably  be
expected  to (i) cause the  Merger  not to  constitute  a  reorganization  under
Section  368 of the  Code or (ii)  materially  impede  or delay  receipt  of any
consents of regulatory  authorities  referred to in Section  5.4(b) or result in
failure of the condition in Section 6.3(b).

3.24     State Takeover Laws
         -------------------

     Republic and each Republic  Subsidiary  have taken all necessary  action to
exempt the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  from any  applicable
moratorium,   fair  price,   business   combination,   control  share  or  other
anti-takeover laws, and no such law shall be activated or applied as a result of
such  transactions.  Neither  the  Articles of  Incorporation  nor the Bylaws of
Republic,  nor any other  document of Republic or to which  Republic is a party,
contains  a  provision  that  requires  more than a  majority  of the  shares of
Republic  Common  Stock  entitled to vote,  or the vote or approval of any other
class of capital  stock or voting  security,  to approve the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

3.25     Labor Relations
         ---------------

     Neither Republic nor any Republic Subsidiary is the subject of any claim or
allegation that it has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of
the National Labor  Relations Act or comparable  state law) or seeking to compel
it to  bargain  with  any  labor  organization  as to  wages  or  conditions  of
employment, nor is Republic or


                                       28
<PAGE>

any Republic Subsidiary party to any collective bargaining  agreement.  There is
no strike or other labor dispute involving Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary,
pending  or  threatened,  or to the best  knowledge  of  Republic,  is there any
activity involving any employees of Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary seeking
to certify a collective  bargaining  unit or engaging in any other  organization
activity.

3.26     Fairness Opinion
         ----------------

     Republic has received from its  Financial  Advisor an opinion to the effect

shareholders of Republic from a financial point of view.

3.27     No Right to Dissent
         -------------------

     Nothing in the Articles of  Incorporation  or the Bylaws of Republic or any
Republic Subsidiary  provides or would provide to any person,  including without
limitation  the  holders  of  Republic  Common  Stock,  upon  execution  of this
Agreement  or  the  Plan  of  Merger  and   consummation  of  the   transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, rights of dissent and appraisal of any kind.

way  limiting  its  operations  (other  than  general  regulatory   restrictions
applicable to similarly situated banks and bank holding companies). Neither BB&T

desist order, agreement,  directive,  memorandum of understanding or commitment,
and  since  December  31,  2000  none of them  has  received  any  communication

reports, registrations, notices and statements, and any amendments thereto, that
it  was  required  to  file  with  federal  and  state  regulatory  authorities,
including,  without limitation, the Commission,  FDIC, Federal Reserve Board and
applicable  state  regulators.  Each  such  report,  registration,   notice  and
statement,   and  each  amendment   thereto,   complied  with  applicable  legal
requirements.

5.1      Shareholder Meetings
         --------------------

     Republic  shall  submit  this  Agreement  and  the  Plan of  Merger  to its
shareholders  for  approval  at a  meeting  to be held  as  soon  as  reasonably
practicable  following  the  effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement.  By
approving this Agreement and authorizing  its execution,  the Board of Directors
of Republic agrees that it shall, at the time the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus is
mailed to the shareholders of Republic,  recommend that Republic's  shareholders
vote for such approval; provided that, if a Superior Offer shall be made and the
Board of Directors of Republic, after consultation with (and based on the advice
of)  counsel,  determines  in good faith  that,  continuing  to  recommend  this
Agreement  and the Plan of Merger would more likely than not result in violation
of its  fiduciary  duties  under  applicable  law then the Board of Directors of
Republic  may  submit  this  Agreement  and the  Plan of  Merger  to  Republic's
shareholders  without  recommendation  (although the  resolutions  adopting this
Agreement  and the Plan of Merger as of the date hereof may not be  rescinded or
amended),  in which event the Board of Directors of Republic  shall  communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation  to the Republic  shareholders to the
extent required by law; provided that the Board of Directors of Republic may not
take any  actions  under this  sentence  until  after  giving BB&T at least five
Business Days to respond to such Superior Offer (and after giving BB&T notice of
the identity of the offeror and the latest  material terms and conditions of the
Superior  Offer) and if BB&T shall propose any amendment or modification of this
Agreement,  until  after  determining  that  the  Superior  Offer  continues  to
constitute a Superior Offer.  At the time of execution of this  Agreement,  each
member of the Board of Directors of Republic has executed an agreement with BB&T
obligating  the director to vote all shares over which such  director has voting
control in favor the Plan of Merger and to not transfer  prior to the  Effective
Time any such shares over which such director has voting control.

         --------------------------------------------------

     As promptly as  practicable  after the date hereof,  BB&T shall prepare and
file the  Registration  Statement with the Commission.  Republic will furnish to
BB&T the information required to be included in the Registration  Statement with
respect to its business and affairs  before it is filed with the  Commission and
again before any  amendments  are filed,  and  Republic  shall have the right to
review and consult with BB&T on the form of, and any  characterizations  of such
information included in, the Registration Statement prior to the filing with the
Commission. Such Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective and on
the Effective Time,  shall in all material  respects conform to the requirements
of  the  Securities  Act  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the
Commission.   The  Registration  Statement  shall  include  the  form  of  Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.  BB&T and  Republic  shall use all  reasonable  efforts to
cause  the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus  to be  approved  by the  Commission  for
mailing to the Republic shareholders, and such Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall,
on the date of mailing,  conform in all material respects to the requirements of
the Securities  Laws and the applicable  rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder.  Republic shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
its  respective   shareholders   in  accordance   with  all  applicable   notice
requirements  under the Securities Laws, the FBCA, and the rules and regulations
of NASDAQ.

5.3      Plan of Merger; Reservation of Shares
         -------------------------------------

     At the Effective  Time, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the
Plan of Merger.  In  connection  therewith,  BB&T  acknowledges  that it (i) has
adopted  the Plan of  Merger  and (ii) will pay or cause to be paid when due the
Merger  Consideration.  BB&T has reserved for issuance  such number of shares of
BB&T Common  Stock as shall be  necessary  to pay the Merger  Consideration  and
agrees  not to take  any  action  that  would  cause  the  aggregate  number  of
authorized  shares of BB&T Common Stock available for issuance  hereunder not to
be  sufficient  to effect the  Merger.  If at any time the  aggregate  number of
shares of BB&T Common Stock reserved for issuance hereunder is not sufficient to
effect the Merger,  BB&T shall take all appropriate action as may be required to
increase the number of shares of BB&T Common Stock reserved for such purpose.

5.4      Additional Acts
         ---------------

     (a)  Republic  agrees  to take  such  actions  requested  by BB&T as may be
reasonably necessary to modify the structure of, or to substitute parties to (so
long as  such  substitute  is  BB&T  or a  wholly  owned  BB&T  Subsidiary)  the
transactions contemplated hereby, provided that such modifications do not change
the Merger  Consideration  (including the tax treatment thereof) or abrogate the
covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement,  including,  without
limitation,  the covenant not to take any action that would  substantially delay
completion  of, or  substantially  impair the prospects of completing the Merger
pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger.

401(k) plan of Republic (the "Republic 401(k) Plan"), BB&T shall cause such plan
to be merged with the 401(k) plan  maintained by BB&T and the BB&T  Subsidiaries
or to be frozen,  in each case as  determined by BB&T and subject to the receipt
of all  applicable  regulatory  or  governmental  approvals.  Each  employee  of
Republic  or  any  Republic  Subsidiary  at  the  Effective  Time  (i)  who is a
participant  in  the  Republic   401(k)  Plan,  (ii)  who  becomes  an  employee
immediately  following the Effective  Time of BB&T or of any  subsidiary of BB&T
(collectively  with BB&T an "Employer  Entity"),  and (iii) who continues in the
employment of an Employer Entity until the Benefit Plan  Determination  Date for
the Republic 401(k) Plan, shall be eligible to participate in BB&T's 401(k) plan
as of the Benefit Plan Determination  Date. Until the Benefit Plan Determination
Date, BB&T shall continue in effect for the benefit of  participating  employees
(including those Transferred Employees who become eligible to participate in the
Republic  401(k) Plan after the  Effective  Time but prior to the  Benefit  Plan
Determination  Date) the Republic  401(k) Plan and any related  supplemental  or
excess benefit defined  contribution  plans,  without amendment except as may be
required by applicable law. Any employee of Republic or any Republic Subsidiary,
who is not a  participant  in the  Republic  401(k) Plan as of the Benefit  Plan
Determination  Date,  shall be eligible to be a  participant  in the BB&T 401(k)
plan upon complying with the eligibility  requirements after taking into account
the service  crediting  provisions set forth below. All rights to participate in
BB&T's  401(k) plan are subject to BB&T's right to amend or terminate  the plan.
For purposes of administering BB&T's 401(k) plan and any related supplemental or
excess benefit plan of BB&T, service with Republic and the Republic Subsidiaries
(or any  predecessor  entities to the extent  such  service  was  recognized  by
Republic)  shall be deemed to be service with BB&T or any other Employer  Entity
for purposes of participation,  vesting and benefit  accruals.  Each employee of
Republic or a Republic



                                       40
<PAGE>

Subsidiary at the Effective Time who becomes an employee  immediately  following
the Effective Time of an Employer Entity is referred to herein as a "Transferred
Employee."

     (b) Each  Transferred  Employee  shall be eligible to  participate in group
hospitalization,  medical,  dental,  life,  disability and other welfare benefit
plans and programs  available to  similarly  situated  employees of the Employer
Entity,  subject to the terms of such plans and programs, as of the Benefit Plan
Determination  Date  for  each  such  plan  or  program,  conditional  upon  the
Transferred  Employee's  being employed by an Employer Entity as of such Benefit
Plan   Determination   Date  and  subject  to  complying  with  the  eligibility
requirements of the respective  plans and programs after taking into account the
service crediting and other provisions set forth below.  Following the Effective
Time, BB&T shall or shall cause the applicable  Employer Entity to continue each
welfare  benefit  plan or program of Republic or the  Republic  Subsidiaries  in
effect for the benefit of the Transferred  Employees without amendment except as
may be required by applicable law, so long as the Transferred  Employees  remain
eligible  to  participate  and  until  they  shall  become  eligible  to  become
participants  in the  corresponding  plan or program  maintained by the Employer
Entity (and, with respect to any such plan or program, subject to complying with
the eligibility requirements after taking into account the service crediting and
other provisions set forth below and subject to the right of the Employer Entity
to  terminate  such  plan  or  program).  Retirees  of  Republic  or a  Republic
Subsidiary and Transferred Employees, who are either participants in or eligible
to  participate  in  the  Republic   retiree   medical   benefits  plan,   shall
automatically   become  participants  in  or  eligible  to  participate  in  (as
applicable to each such individual) the BB&T retiree medical benefits plan as of
the retiree medical Benefit Plan Determination Date, and BB&T shall continue the
Republic retiree medical benefits plan in effect without amendment except as may
be required by applicable  law until such Benefit Plan  Determination  Date. For
purposes of administering the welfare plans and programs subject to this Section
5.12(b),  service with Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary (or any  predecessor
entities to the extent such service was recognized by Republic)  shall be deemed
to be  service  with  BB&T  or  another  Employer  Entity  for  the  purpose  of
determining  eligibility  to  participate,   vesting  (if  applicable),  benefit
accruals   (solely  for  purposes  of  vacation  and  seniority   entitlements),
commencement of benefits and benefit subsidies (including without limitation for
retiree medical benefit subsidies) in such welfare plans and programs.  From and
after  the  Effective  Time  (or  the  Benefit  Plan   Determination   Date,  as
applicable),  BB&T shall or shall cause another Employer Entity to (i) cause any
pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any
group  health  plans of an  Employer  Entity to be waived  with  respect  to the
Transferred Employees and the retirees of Republic and the Republic Subsidiaries
who are  participants  in or eligible to  participate  in the  Republic  retiree
medical benefits plan and (ii) give each  Transferred  Employee and the retirees
of Republic and the Republic Subsidiaries who are participants in or eligible to
participate in the Republic  retiree medical benefits plan (when retired) credit
for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or the Benefit Plan Determination
Date,  as  applicable)   occurs  towards   applicable   deductibles  and  annual
out-of-pocket  limits for expenses  incurred prior to the Effective Time (or the
Benefit Plan Determination Date, as applicable).  The provisions of this


                                       41
<PAGE>

Section 5.12(b) shall apply equally to the eligible  dependents of a Transferred
Employee and of a retiree of Republic and the Republic Subsidiaries.

     (c)  Except  to the  extent  of  commitments  herein  or other  contractual
commitments,  if any,  specifically  made or assumed  hereunder  or otherwise by
BB&T,  neither BB&T nor any Employer  Entity shall have any  obligation  arising
from the Merger to continue  any  Transferred  Employees in its employ or in any
specific job or to provide to any  Transferred  Employee any specified  level of
compensation  or  any  incentive   payments,   benefits  or  perquisites.   Each
Transferred  Employee who is terminated by an Employer Entity  subsequent to the
Effective  Time,  excluding  any  employee  who  has a  then  existing  contract
providing for severance in lieu of severance plan benefits, shall be entitled to
severance pay in accordance with the general severance policy of BB&T as then in
effect,  if and to the extent  that such  Transferred  Employee  is  entitled to
severance  pay and  benefits  under  the  applicable  policy.  Each  Transferred
Employee's severance pay and benefits, if any, under the severance policy, shall
be determined based on aggregate service of a Transferred Employee with Republic
and the Republic  Subsidiaries  (or any predecessor  entities to the extent such
service was recognized by Republic) prior to the Effective Time and with BB&T or
another  Employer  Entity on and after the Effective Time, with all service with
Republic  and the  Republic  Subsidiaries  (or any  predecessor  entities to the
extent such service was recognized by Republic)  being deemed to be service with
BB&T or another Employer Entity.

     (d) With  respect to the defined  benefit  pension  plan of  Republic  (the
"Republic  Pension  Plan"),  BB&T shall  cause  such plan to be merged  with the
defined benefit pension plan maintained by BB&T and the BB&T  Subsidiaries  (the
"BB&T  Pension  Plan"),  subject  to and  conditional  upon the  receipt  of all
applicable regulatory or governmental approvals.  Each Transferred Employee, who
is a  participant  in the Republic  Pension Plan at the  Effective  Time and who
continues  in the  employment  of an  Employer  Entity  until the  Benefit  Plan
Determination  Date with respect to the Republic Pension Plan, shall be eligible
to  participate  in the BB&T Pension  Plan as of the Benefit Plan  Determination
Date. Until the Benefit Plan  Determination  Date, BB&T shall continue in effect
for  the  benefit  of  participating   employees  (including  those  Transferred
Employees who become eligible to participate in the Republic  Pension Plan after
the  Effective  Time but  prior to the  Benefit  Plan  Determination  Date)  the
Republic  Pension Plan and any related  supplemental  or excess defined  benefit
plans,  without  amendment except as required by applicable law. Any employee of
Republic  or a Republic  Subsidiary  who is not a  participant  in the  Republic
Pension  Plan as of the  Benefit  Plan  Determination  Date shall be eligible to
participate  in the BB&T  Pension  Plan  upon  complying  with  the  eligibility
requirements  after taking into  account the service  crediting  provisions  set
forth below.  All rights to  participate in the BB&T Pension Plan are subject to
BB&T's right to amend or terminate  the plan. As of the close of business on the
date  immediately  preceding  the Benefit Plan  Determination  Date,  BB&T shall
determine the accrued  benefit  under the Republic  Pension Plan with respect to
participants  continuing  in the service of an  Employer  Entity.  Such  accrued
benefit  shall be  determined  by taking into account  service and  compensation
following the Effective Time and preceding the



                                       42
<PAGE>

Benefit Plan Determination  Date, and the accrued benefit as so determined shall
be the accrued  benefit  under the BB&T  Pension  Plan for service  prior to the
Benefit Plan Determination Date (and shall be added to the benefit accrued under
the BB&T Pension Plan for service and  compensation  beginning  with the Benefit
Plan  Determination  Date). For purposes of administering the BB&T Pension Plan,
service  with  Republic  and the  Republic  Subsidiaries  (and  any  predecessor
entities to the extent such service was recognized by Republic)  shall be deemed
to be service  with BB&T for  participation  and vesting  purposes,  but not for
purposes of benefit accrual.

     (e) BB&T agrees to honor all employment  agreements,  severance agreements,
supplemental  retirement  and deferred  compensation  agreements  and plans that
Republic  and the  Republic  Subsidiaries  have with or in place with respect to
their current and former  employees and directors and which have been  Disclosed
to BB&T  pursuant to this  Agreement,  except to the extent any such  agreements
shall be  superseded or terminated at the Closing or following the Closing Date,
to the extent  permitted by and in accordance  with their terms.  Except for the
agreements  described in the preceding sentence and except as otherwise provided
in this  Section  5.12,  following  the  Effective  Time,  (i)  the  Transferred
Employees  shall be eligible to participate  in such other employee  benefit and
compensation  plans as are provided to similarly  situated employees of BB&T and
its   Subsidiaries   and  subject  to  complying  with  applicable   eligibility
requirements,  (ii) for purposes of administering such other plans, service with
Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary (or any predecessor  entities to the extent
such service was recognized by Republic) shall be deemed to be service with BB&T
or  another  Employer  Entity  for the  purpose of  determining  eligibility  to
participate and vesting (if applicable), and (iii) the employee benefit plans of
Republic  may,  in the sole  discretion  of  BB&T,  be  frozen  or  merged  into
comparable plans of BB&T, or terminated in the case of non-qualified  retirement
plans, effective as of such time as BB&T shall determine in its sole discretion,
to the extent permitted by and in accordance with their terms.

5.13     Directors' and Officers' Protection
         -----------------------------------

     BB&T or a BB&T  Subsidiary  shall provide and keep in force for a period of
three  years  after  the  Effective  Time  directors'  and  officers'  liability
insurance  providing  coverage to directors and officers of Republic for acts or
omissions or alleged acts or omissions  occurring  prior to the Effective  Time.
Such insurance shall provide at least the same coverage and amounts as contained
in Republic's  policy on the date hereof;  provided,  that in no event shall the
annual  premium on such  policy  exceed 175% of the annual  premium  payments on
Republic's policy in effect as of the date hereof (the "Maximum Amount"). If the
amount of the premiums  necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds  the  Maximum  Amount,  BB&T shall use its  reasonable  best  efforts to
maintain the most  advantageous  policies of directors' and officers'  liability
insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.  Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  BB&T further  agrees to indemnify  from and after the Effective
Time all  individuals  who are or have been officers,  directors or employees of
Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time with respect to
any acts or omissions or


                                       43
<PAGE>

alleged acts or omissions in such capacities prior to the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

5.14     Forbearances of BB&T
         --------------------

     Except with the prior written consent of Republic,  between the date hereof
and the  Effective  Time,  neither BB&T nor any BB&T  Subsidiary  shall take any
action  which  would  or might  reasonably  be  expected  to (i)  result  in any
inaccuracy  of  a  representation  or  warranty  herein  that  would  allow  for
termination of this Agreement; (ii) cause any of the conditions precedent to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to fail to be satisfied;  (iii) fail
to comply in any material  respect  with any laws,  regulations,  ordinances  or
governmental  actions applicable to it and to the conduct of its business;  (iv)
amend its Articles of  Incorporation  or bylaws in a manner that would adversely
affect the  economic  benefits of the Merger to the  holders of Republic  Common
Stock; (v) enter into any agreement to acquire all or  substantially  all of the
capital stock or assets of any other person or business unless such  transaction
would not  substantially  delay  completion  of,  or  substantially  impair  the
prospects of completing,  the Merger  pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of
Merger; (vi) agree to do any of the foregoing.

5.15     Reports
         -------

     Each of  Republic  and BB&T  shall  file  (and  shall  cause  the  Republic
Subsidiaries and the BB&T Subsidiaries, respectively, to file), between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, all reports required to be filed by it
with the Commission and any other  regulatory  authorities  having  jurisdiction
over such  party,  and shall  deliver to BB&T or  Republic,  as the case may be,
copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed.

5.16     Exchange Listing
         ----------------

     BB&T shall use its reasonable best efforts to list,  prior to the Effective
Time, on the NYSE,  subject to official  notice of issuance,  the shares of BB&T
Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Republic  Common  Stock  pursuant to
the Merger,  and BB&T shall give all notices and make all filings  with the NYSE
required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

5.17     Advisory Board
         --------------

     As of the  Effective  Time,  BB&T shall offer to each of the members of the
Board of  Directors  of Republic  (other than William R. Hough) a seat on a BB&T
Advisory  Board  (which  Advisory  Board may be existing  or newly  established)
serving a BB&T Florida region  determined by BB&T.  For two years  following the
Effective  Time, the Advisory Board members  appointed  pursuant to this Section
5.17 who are not  employees of BB&T or a BB&T  Affiliate or under  contract with
BB&T or any  BB&T  Affiliate,  and who  continue  to  serve  shall  receive,  as
compensation  for service on the Advisory  Board,


                                       44

Advisory  Board  member's fees (annual  retainer and  attendance  fees) equal in
amount each year  (prorated  for any partial  year) to the annual  retainer  and
schedule of  attendance  fees for directors of Republic in effect on the date of
this Agreement.  Following such two-year period,  Advisory Board Members who are
entitled to receive  Advisory  Board Member fees,  if they  continue to serve in
such capacity, shall receive fees in accordance with BB&T's standard schedule of
fees for service thereon as in effect from time to time. For two years after the
Effective  Time, no such Advisory Board member shall be prohibited  from serving
thereon  because he or she shall  have  attained  the  maximum  age for  service
thereon (currently age 70). Membership of any person on any Advisory Board shall
be conditional  upon  execution of an agreement  providing that such person will
not  engage in  activities  competitive  with BB&T for two years  following  the
Effective  Time or,  if  longer,  the  period  that he or she is a member of the
Advisory Board.

Executive  Officer of BB&T, to Branch Bank's Board of Directors,  to serve until
its next  annual  meeting  (subject  to the  right of  removal  for  cause)  and
thereafter so long as he or she is elected and qualifies.  For three years after
the Effective  Time,  William R. Hough shall not be  prohibited  from serving on
such Board  because he shall have  attained the maximum age for service  thereon
(currently age 70). Any member of such Board of Directors who is not an employee
of BB&T or a BB&T  Affiliate  or under  contract  with BB&T or a BB&T  Affiliate
shall be entitled to receive  fees for service on the Board in  accordance  with
BB&T's policies as in effect from time to time.  Membership of any person on any
such Board shall be conditional  upon  execution of an agreement  providing that
such person will not engage in  activities  competitive  with BB&T for two years
following  the  Effective  Time or, if longer,  the  period  that he or she is a
member of such Board.

5.19     Tax Treatment
         -------------

     From the date hereof  through the  Effective  Time,  BB&T shall,  and shall
cause its Affiliates to, and Republic  shall,  and shall cause its  Subsidiaries
to,  each use  their  reasonable  best  efforts  to take  such  action as may be
necessary  to cause the Merger to qualify  as,  and to refrain  from  taking any
action which could  reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying
as, as the case may be, a reorganization  under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the Code.

event of a  material  breach by the other  party of any  covenant  or  agreement
contained  in this  Agreement,  or (ii) in the  event  of an  inaccuracy  of any
representation or warranty of the other party contained in this Agreement, which
breach or inaccuracy would provide the nonbreaching  party the ability to refuse
to  consummate  the Merger  under the  applicable  standard set forth in Section
6.2(a) or (b) in the case of Republic  and Section  6.3(a) or (c) in the case of
BB&T; and, in the case of (i) or (ii), if such breach or inaccuracy has not been

the party  committing  such breach or the date set forth in paragraph  (f) below
whichever is earlier.

     (c) At any time prior to the  Effective  Time,  by either  party  hereto in
writing, if any of the conditions  precedent to the obligations of such party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be satisfied or fulfilled
prior to the Closing  Date,  and the party  giving the notice is not in material
breach of any of its  representations,  warranties,  covenants  or  undertakings
herein.

     (d) At any  time,  by either  party  hereto in  writing,  if any  Requisite
Regulatory  Approval  has been  denied,  and the time  period  for  appeals  and

representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings herein.

     (g) At any time prior to the  Effective  Time,  by BB&T in writing,  if the
Board of  Directors  of Republic  shall have  withdrawn  its  recommendation  or
refused to recommend to the  shareholders  of Republic that they vote to approve
the Plan of Merger in compliance with Section 5.1, or shall have  recommended to
the  shareholders  of Republic  approval of an  agreement,  plan or  transaction
arising  out of or  implementing  any  Republic  Acquisition  Proposal.  As used
herein,  "Republic  Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer to acquire
or  purchase  all or a  substantial  portion of the  assets of or a  substantial
equity  interest  in,  or  to  effect  any   recapitalization,   liquidation  or

with, Republic or any Republic Subsidiary (including, without limitation, a bona
fide tender offer or exchange  offer to purchase  Republic  Common  Stock) other

         ---------------------

     In the event this  Agreement and the Plan of Merger is terminated  pursuant

have  no  effect,   except   that  (i)  the   provisions   hereof   relating  to
confidentiality, the Termination Fee and expenses set forth in Sections 5.7, 7.6
and 8.1, respectively, shall survive any such termination and (ii) a termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) shall not relieve the breaching  party from liability
for a breach of the covenant, agreement,  representation or warranty giving rise
to such termination.

7.3      Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants
         -----------------------------------------------------

     All representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or the Plan

covenants  that by their  terms are to be  performed  after the  Effective  Time
(including Sections 5.13, 5.17 and 5.18); provided that no such representations,
warranties or covenants  shall be deemed to be terminated or  extinguished so as
to deprive  BB&T or Republic (or any  director,  officer or  controlling  person
thereof) of any defense at law or in equity which  otherwise  would be available
against the claims of any person, including, without limitation, any shareholder
or former shareholder of either BB&T or Republic, the aforesaid representations,
warranties and covenants being material  inducements to consummation by BB&T and
Republic of the transactions contemplated herein.

     Except with respect to any required regulatory approval, each party hereto,
by written  instrument  signed by an executive officer of such party, may at any

by the Republic  shareholders) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations  or other  acts of the  other  party  hereto  and may  waive (i) any
inaccuracies of the other party in the  representations or warranties  contained
in this Agreement,  the Plan of Merger or any document delivered pursuant hereto
or  thereto,  (ii)  compliance  with  any  of  the  covenants,  undertakings  or
agreements  of the  other  party,  or  satisfaction  of  any  of the  conditions
precedent  to its  obligations,  contained  herein or in the Plan of Merger,  or
(iii) the  performance  by the  other  party of any of its  obligations  set out

          be entitled to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b); and
          (2) (A) a  Republic  Acquisition  Proposal  shall  have been  publicly

          dissolution  involving,  or a business  combination  or other  similar
          transaction  with,  Republic or any  Republic  Subsidiary  (including,

          BB&T Subsidiary;

and, within fifteen (15) months of such termination,  Republic  consummates,  or
enters into a definitive  agreement with respect to consummation  of, a Republic
Acquisition Proposal (an "Alternative  Transaction Event"),  then Republic shall
within two Business Days after the  occurrence of such  Alternative  Transaction
Event,  pay to BB&T a termination  fee equal to  $17,000,000  (the  "Termination
Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Termination Fee shall

are an integral  part of the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement and
that,  without  these  agreements,  BB&T  would not enter  into this  Agreement;
accordingly,  if  Republic  fails  promptly  to pay any amount due  pursuant  to
Section 7.6(a) and, in order to obtain such payment, BB&T commences a suit which
results in a judgment against  Republic for all or a substantial  portion of the
payment set forth in Section  7.6(a),  Republic  shall pay to BB&T its costs and
expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit,
together  with  interest on the  Termination  Fee from the date that payment was
required  to be made until the date  payment is made at the prime rate of Branch
Banking and Trust  Company in effect on the date payment was required to be made
plus two percentage points.
